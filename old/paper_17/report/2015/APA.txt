item 1a.   risk factors

our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant hazards and risks, including those described below. if any of such events should occur, our business, financial condition, liquidity, and/or results of operations could be materially harmed, and holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments. additional risks relating to our securities may be included in the prospectuses for securities we issue in the future.
crude oil and natural gas price volatility, including the recent decline in prices for oil and natural gas, could adversely affect our operating results and the price of our common stock.
our revenues, operating results, and future rate of growth depend highly upon the prices we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production. historically, the markets for crude oil and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. for example, the nymex daily settlement price for the prompt month oil contract in 2015 ranged from a high of $61.43 per barrel to a low of $34.73 per barrel. the nymex daily settlement price for the prompt month natural gas contract in 2015 ranged from a high of $3.23 per mmbtu to a low of $1.76 per mmbtu. the market prices for crude oil and natural gas depend on factors beyond our control. these factors include demand for crude oil and natural gas, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions, and other factors, including:
   worldwide and domestic supplies of crude oil and natural gas;

   actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations;

   political conditions and events (including instability, changes in governments, or armed conflict) in crude oil or natural gas producing regions;

   the level of global crude oil and natural gas inventories;

   the price and level of imported foreign crude oil and natural gas;

   the price and availability of alternative fuels, including coal and biofuels;

   the availability of pipeline capacity and infrastructure;

   the availability of crude oil transportation and refining capacity;

   weather conditions;

   domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and

   the overall economic environment.

our results of operations, as well as the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, are substantially dependent upon the prices of oil and natural gas, which have declined significantly since june 2014. the recent declines in oil and natural gas prices have adversely affected our revenues, operating income, cash flow, and proved reserves. continued low prices could have a material adverse impact on our operations and limit our ability to fund capital expenditures. without the ability to fund capital expenditures, we would be unable to replace reserves and production. sustained low prices of crude oil and natural gas may further adversely impact our business as follows:
   limiting our financial condition, liquidity, and/or ability to fund planned capital expenditures and operations;

   reducing the amount of crude oil and natural gas that we can produce economically;

   causing us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects;

   reducing our revenues, operating income, and cash flows;

16
   limiting our access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt;

   reducing the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties, resulting in additional non-cash write-downs;

   reducing the carrying value of our gathering, transmission, and processing facilities, resulting in additional impairments; or

   reducing the carrying value of goodwill.

our ability to sell natural gas or oil and/or receive market prices for our natural gas or oil may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints and various transportation interruptions.
a portion of our natural gas and oil production in any region may be interrupted, limited, or shut in, from time to time for numerous reasons, including as a result of weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues or strikes, or capital constraints that limit the ability of third parties to construct gathering systems, processing facilities, or interstate pipelines to transport our production, or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, it could temporarily adversely affect our cash flows.
future economic conditions in the u.s. and certain international markets may materially adversely impact our operating results.
current global market conditions, and uncertainty, including economic instability in europe and certain emerging markets, is likely to have significant long-term effects. global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources, including fossil fuels. a lower future economic growth rate could result in decreased demand growth for our crude oil and natural gas production as well as lower commodity prices, which would reduce our cash flows from operations and our profitability.
weather and climate may have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and productivity.
demand for oil and natural gas are, to a degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impact the price we receive for the commodities we produce. in addition, our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by severe weather, such as freezing temperatures, hurricanes in the gulf of mexico or storms in the north sea, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment. our planning for normal climatic variation, insurance programs, and emergency recovery plans may inadequately mitigate the effects of such weather conditions, and not all such effects can be predicted, eliminated, or insured against.
our operations involve a high degree of operational risk, particularly risk of personal injury, damage, or loss of equipment, and environmental accidents.
our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling, production, and transportation of crude oil and natural gas, including:
   well blowouts, explosions, and cratering;

   pipeline or other facility ruptures and spills;

   fires;

   formations with abnormal pressures;

   equipment malfunctions;

   hurricanes, storms, and/or cyclones, which could affect our operations in areas such as on and offshore the gulf coast and north sea and other natural disasters and weather conditions; and

17
   surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents, saltwater, or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives.

failure or loss of equipment as the result of equipment malfunctions, cyber attacks, or natural disasters such as hurricanes, could result in property damages, personal injury, environmental pollution and other damages for which we could be liable. litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence, such as a well blowout, explosion, or fire at a location where our equipment and services are used, or ground water contamination from hydraulic fracturing chemical additives may result in substantial claims for damages. ineffective containment of a drilling well blowout or pipeline rupture, or surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives could result in extensive environmental pollution and substantial remediation expenses. if a significant amount of our production is interrupted, our containment efforts prove to be ineffective or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence, our cash flows, and, in turn, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
cyber attacks targeting systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may adversely impact our operations.
our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, and production activities. we depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, communicate with our employees and third party partners, and conduct many of our activities. unauthorized access to our digital technology could lead to operational disruption, data corruption or exposure, communication interruption, loss of intellectual property, loss of confidential and fiduciary data, and loss or corruption of reserves or other proprietary information. also, external digital technologies control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution and refining systems in the united states and abroad, which are necessary to transport and market our production. a cyber attack directed at oil and gas distribution systems could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment, delay or prevent delivery of production to markets, and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions.
while we have experienced cyber attacks, we have not suffered any material losses relating to such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. further, as cyber attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyber attacks.
our commodity price risk management and trading activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from price increases and may expose us to other risks.
to the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines, we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. in addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:
   our production falls short of the hedged volumes;

   there is a widening of price-basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement;

   the counterparties to our hedging or other price risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements; or

   an unexpected event materially impacts oil and natural gas prices.

18
the credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect us.
we have exposure to different counterparties, and we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, other investment funds, and other institutions. these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us. in the future, we may have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative transactions in connection with any hedges. we also have exposure to insurance companies in the form of claims under our policies. in addition, if any lender under our credit facilities is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lenders commitment under our credit facilities.
if we were to enter into hedging transactions, we would be exposed to a risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract. this risk of counterparty non-performance is of particular concern given the recent volatility of the financial markets and significant decline in oil and natural gas prices, which could lead to sudden changes in a counterpartys liquidity and impair its ability to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. we are unable to predict sudden changes in a counterpartys creditworthiness or ability to perform. even if we do accurately predict sudden changes, our ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions. furthermore, the bankruptcy of one or more of our hedge providers, or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint, might make it unlikely that we would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed to us by the distressed entity or entities. during periods of falling commodity prices our hedge receivable positions increase, which increases our exposure. if the creditworthiness of our counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance, we could incur a significant loss.
the distressed financial conditions of our purchasers and partners could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or to reimburse us for their share of costs.
concerns about global economic conditions and the volatility of oil and natural gas prices have had a significant adverse impact on the oil and gas industry. we are exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint venture, joint interest billing, and other receivables. we sell our crude oil, natural gas, and ngls to a variety of purchasers. as operator, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective shares of costs. as a result of current economic conditions and the severe decline in oil and natural gas prices, some of our customers and non-operating partners may experience severe financial problems that may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness. we cannot provide assurance that one or more of our financially distressed customers or non-operating partners will not default on their obligations to us or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, future results of operations, or future cash flows. furthermore, the bankruptcy of one or more of our customers or non-operating partners, or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint, might make it unlikely that we would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed by the distressed entity or entities. nonperformance by a trade creditor or non-operating partner could result in significant financial losses.
a downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital.
we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the united states. factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales, and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities. liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix, and commodity pricing levels and others are also considered by the rating agencies. a ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future, increase the cost of future debt, and potentially require us to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain obligations. on february 2, 2016, our credit rating was downgraded by standard and poors to bbb/stable, and on february 25, 2016, our credit rating was downgraded by moodys to baa3/negative outlook, in each case as part of an industry-wide review and downgrade of u.s. exploration and production and oilfield services companies due to deteriorating commodity prices. further downgrades could result in additional postings of between $500 million and $1.1 billion, depending upon timing and availability of tax relief.
19
market conditions may restrict our ability to obtain funds for future development and working capital needs, which may limit our financial flexibility.
the credit markets are subject to fluctuation and are vulnerable to unpredictable shocks. we have a significant development project inventory and an extensive exploration portfolio, which will require substantial future investment. we and/or our partners may need to seek financing in order to fund these or other future activities. our future access to capital, as well as that of our partners and contractors, could be limited if the debt or equity markets are constrained. this could significantly delay development of our property interests.
our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations.
the payment of future dividends on our capital stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors, which considers, among other factors, our operating results, overall financial condition, credit-risk considerations, and capital requirements, as well as general business and market conditions. our board of directors is not required to declare dividends on our common stock and may decide not to declare dividends.
any indentures and other financing agreements that we enter into in the future may limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock, including common stock. in addition, under delaware law, dividends on capital stock may only be paid from surplus, which is the amount by which the fair value of our total assets exceeds the sum of our total liabilities, including contingent liabilities, and the amount of our capital; if there is no surplus, cash dividends on capital stock may only be paid from our net profits for the then current and/or the preceding fiscal year. further, even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and delaware law to pay cash dividends on common stock, we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends in cash on our common stock.
discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production.
the production rate from oil and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted, while related per-unit production costs generally increase as a result of decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors. therefore, unless we add reserves through exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones, secondary recovery reserves, or tertiary recovery reserves, or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves, our estimated proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced. future oil and gas production is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis. furthermore, if oil or gas prices increase, our cost for additional reserves could also increase.
we may not realize an adequate return on wells that we drill.
drilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. the wells we drill or participate in may not be productive, and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells. the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude or natural gas is present or may be produced economically. the costs of drilling, completing, and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including, but not limited to:
   unexpected drilling conditions;

   pressure or irregularities in formations;

   equipment failures or accidents;

   fires, explosions, blowouts, and surface cratering;

   marine risks such as capsizing, collisions, and hurricanes;

20
   other adverse weather conditions; and

   increases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs and equipment.

future drilling activities may not be successful, and, if unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. while all drilling, whether developmental or exploratory, involves these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons.
material differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events or costs may affect the completion and commencement of production from development projects.
we are involved in several large development projects and the completion of these projects may be delayed beyond our anticipated completion dates. our projects may be delayed by project approvals from joint venture partners, timely issuances of permits and licenses by governmental agencies, weather conditions, manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment, and other unforeseen events. delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may adversely affect our large development projects and our ability to participate in large-scale development projects in the future. in addition, our estimates of future development costs are based on current expectation of prices and other costs of equipment and personnel we will need to implement such projects. our actual future development costs may be significantly higher than we currently estimate. if costs become too high, our development projects may become uneconomic to us, and we may be forced to abandon such development projects.
we may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves.
although we perform a review of properties that we acquire that we believe is consistent with industry practices, such reviews are inherently incomplete. it generally is not feasible to review in-depth every individual property involved in each acquisition. ordinarily, we will focus our review efforts on the higher-value properties and will sample the remainder. however, even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us as a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully and accurately their deficiencies and potential. inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. even when problems are identified, we often assume certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties. there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. in addition, there can be no assurance that acquisitions will not have an adverse effect upon our operating results, particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired businesses are being integrated into our ongoing operations.
our liabilities could be adversely affected in the event one or more of our transaction counterparties become the subject of a bankruptcy case.
over the last several years, we have taken action to enhance and streamline our north american portfolio through not only the acquisition of assets in key operating regions but also the divestitures of noncore domestic assets and the monetization of certain nonstrategic international assets. the agreements relating to these transactions contain provisions pursuant to which liabilities related to past and future operations have been allocated between the parties by means of liability assumptions, indemnities, escrows, trusts, and similar arrangements. one or more of the counterparties in these transactions could, either as a result of the severe decline in oil and natural gas prices or other factors related to the historical or future operations of their respective businesses, face financial problems that may have a significant impact on its ability to perform its obligations under these agreements and its solvency and ability to continue as a going concern. in the event that
21
any such counterparty were to become unable financially to perform its liabilities or obligations assumed and as a result become the subject of a case or proceeding under title 11 of the united states code (the bankruptcy code) or any other relevant insolvency law or similar law (which we collectively refer to as insolvency laws) the counterparty may not perform its obligations under the agreements related to these transactions. in that case, our remedy would be a claim in the proceeding for damages for the breach of the contractual arrangement, which may be either a secured claim or an unsecured claim depending on whether or not we have collateral from the counterparty for the performance of the obligations. resolution of our damage claim in such a proceeding may be delayed, and we may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of the obligations assumed by the counterparties under such agreements should they arise.
despite the provisions in our agreements requiring purchasers of our state or federal leasehold interests to assume certain liabilities and obligations related to such interests, if a purchaser of such interests becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant insolvency laws and/or becomes unable financially to perform such liabilities or obligations, the relevant governmental authorities could require us to perform, and hold us responsible for, such liabilities and obligations, such as the decommissioning of such transferred assets. in such event, we may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise.
if a court or a governmental authority were to make any of the foregoing determinations or take any of the foregoing actions, or any similar determination or action, it could adversely impact our cash flows, operations, or financial condition.
crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates, and actual recoveries may vary significantly.
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves and their value. reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. because of the high degree of judgment involved, the accuracy of any reserve estimate is inherently imprecise, and a function of the quality of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation. our reserves estimates are based on 12-month average prices, except where contractual arrangements exist; therefore, reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease. in addition, results of drilling, testing, and production may substantially change the reserve estimates for a given reservoir over time. the estimates of our proved reserves and estimated future net revenues also depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results, including:
   historical production from the area compared with production from other areas;

   the effects of regulations by governmental agencies, including changes to severance and excise taxes;

   future operating costs and capital expenditures; and

   workover and remediation costs.

for these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of those reserves and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may vary substantially. accordingly, reserves estimates may be subject to upward or downward adjustment, and actual production, revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will vary, possibly materially, from estimates.
additionally, because some of our reserves estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis, those estimates are less reliable than the estimates based on a lengthy production history. volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure. in addition, realization or recognition of proved undeveloped reserves will depend on our development schedule and plans. a change in future development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved.
22
certain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.
a sizeable portion of our acreage is currently undeveloped. unless production in paying quantities is established on units containing certain of these leases during their terms, the leases will expire. if our leases expire, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling, and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, and regulatory approvals.
we may incur significant costs related to environmental matters.
as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, we are subject to various federal, provincial, state, local, and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. these laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up and other remediation activities resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution and other damages, limit or constrain operations in affected areas, and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. our efforts to limit our exposure to such liability and cost may prove inadequate and result in significant adverse effects to our results of operations. in addition, it is possible that the increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies could require us to make significant capital expenditures. such capital expenditures could adversely impact our cash flows and our financial condition.
our north american operations are subject to governmental risks that may impact our operations.
our north american operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and by federal, state, provincial, and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, changes in taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies, price or gathering rate controls, and environmental protection laws and regulations.
in response to the deepwater horizon incident in the u.s. gulf of mexico in april 2010, and as directed by the secretary of the u.s. department of the interior, the bureau of ocean energy management (boem) and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement (bsee) issued new guidelines and regulations regarding safety, environmental matters, drilling equipment, and decommissioning applicable to drilling in the gulf of mexico. these regulations imposed additional requirements and caused delays with respect to development and production activities in the gulf of mexico.
with respect to oil and gas operations in the gulf of mexico, the boem is currently planning to issue a new notice to lessees (ntl) significantly revising the obligations of companies operating in the gulf of mexico to provide supplemental assurances of performance with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations associated with wells, platforms, structures, and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies oil and gas leases. we currently expect such new ntl may require that apache provide additional security to boem with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations relating to apaches current ownership interests in various gulf of mexico leases. we are working closely with boem to make arrangements for the provision of such additional required security, if such security becomes necessary under the new ntl. additionally, we are not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which apache has sold gulf of mexico assets or with whom apache has joint ownership. such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially, thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties solvency and ability to continue as a going concern.
new political developments, laws, and the enactment of new or stricter regulations in the gulf of mexico or otherwise impacting our north american operations, and increased liability for companies operating in this sector may adversely impact our results of operations.
23
changes to existing regulations related to emissions and the impact of any changes in climate could adversely impact our business.
certain countries where we operate, including canada and the united kingdom, either tax or assess some form of greenhouse gas (ghg) related fees on our operations. exposure has not been material to date, although a change in existing regulations could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.
in the event the predictions for rising temperatures and sea levels suggested by reports of the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change do transpire, we do not believe those events by themselves are likely to impact our assets or operations. however, any increase in severe weather could have a material adverse effect on our assets and operations.
the proposed u.s. federal budget for fiscal year 2017 includes certain provisions that, if passed as originally submitted, will have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
on february 9, 2016, the office of management and budget released a summary of the proposed u.s. federal budget for fiscal year 2017. the proposed budget repeals many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by u.s. oil and gas companies, and includes proposals to increase royalties and lease fees on oil and gas produced from federal lands in the united states. these provisions include elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred; increases in the taxation of foreign source income; repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for oil and natural gas companies; an increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers; and the imposition of a $10.25 per-barrel fee on oil production to fund investments in a clean transportation system. should some or all of these provisions become law, our taxes will increase, potentially significantly, which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows. this could also cause us to reduce our drilling activities in the u.s. since none of these proposals have yet to be voted on or become law, we do not know the ultimate impact these proposed changes may have on our business.
proposed federal, state, or local regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase our operating and capital costs.
several proposals are before the u.s. congress that, if implemented, would either prohibit or restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to regulation under the safe drinking water act. several states are considering legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices that could impose more stringent permitting, transparency, and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. hydraulic fracturing of wells and subsurface water disposal are also under public and governmental scrutiny due to potential environmental and physical impacts, including possible contamination of groundwater and drinking water and possible links to earthquakes. in addition, some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities and/or hydraulic fracturing, or are considering doing so. we routinely use fracturing techniques in the u.s. and other regions to expand the available space for natural gas and oil to migrate toward the wellbore. it is typically done at substantial depths in very tight formations.
although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the legislation regarding hydraulic fracturing, any new federal, state, or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions in the u.s.
international operations have uncertain political, economic, and other risks.
our operations outside north america are based primarily in egypt and the united kingdom. on a barrel equivalent basis, approximately 40 percent of our 2015 production was outside north america, and approximately 28 percent of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves on december 31, 2015, were located
24
outside north america. as a result, a significant portion of our production and resources are subject to the increased political and economic risks and other factors associated with international operations including, but not limited to:
   general strikes and civil unrest;

   the risk of war, acts of terrorism, expropriation and resource nationalization, forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts;

   import and export regulations;

   taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims, and investment restrictions;

   price control;

   transportation regulations and tariffs;

   constrained natural gas markets dependent on demand in a single or limited geographical area;

   exchange controls, currency fluctuations, devaluation, or other activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments or the movement of funds;

   laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade, including trade sanctions;

   the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where we currently operate;

   the possible inability to subject foreign persons, especially foreign oil ministries and national oil companies, to the jurisdiction of courts in the united states; and

   difficulties in enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations.

foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and gas properties through border disputes. if a country claims superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to us by another country, our interests could decrease in value or be lost. even our smaller international assets may affect our overall business and results of operations by distracting managements attention from our more significant assets. certain regions of the world in which we operate have a history of political and economic instability. this instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investments such as ours. in an extreme case, such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of our assets. this could adversely affect our interests and our future profitability.
the impact that future terrorist attacks by groups such as isis or regional hostilities as have occurred in egypt and libya may have on the oil and gas industry in general, and on our operations in particular, is not known at this time. uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines, production facilities, processing plants, and refineries, could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror or war. we may be required to incur significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against terrorist activities.
a deterioration of conditions in egypt or changes in the economic and political environment in egypt could have an adverse impact on our business.
deterioration in the political, economic, and social conditions or other relevant policies of the egyptian government, such as changes in laws or regulations, export restrictions, expropriation of our assets or resource nationalization, and/or forced renegotiation or modification of our existing contracts with egpc, or threats or
25
acts of terrorism by groups such as isis, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our operations in egypt, excluding sinopecs one-third noncontrolling interest, contributed 20 percent of our 2015 production and accounted for 14 percent of our year-end estimated proved reserves and 27 percent of our estimated discounted future net cash flows.
our operations are sensitive to currency rate fluctuations.
our operations are sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly between the u.s. dollar and the canadian dollar, and between the u.s. dollar and the british pound. our financial statements, presented in u.s. dollars, may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the u.s. dollar relative to other currencies.
we face strong industry competition that may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.
strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas exploration and production industry. we compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for acquisition of oil and gas leases, properties, and reserves, equipment, and labor required to explore, develop, and operate those properties, and marketing of oil and natural gas production. crude oil and natural gas prices impact the costs of properties available for acquisition and the number of companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities. many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than we possess and have established strategic long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry. as a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights. in addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as fluctuating worldwide commodity prices and levels of production, the cost and availability of alternative fuels, and the application of government regulations. we also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists, engineers, and other specialists. these competitive pressures may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.
our insurance policies do not cover all of the risks we face, which could result in significant financial exposure.
exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas can be hazardous, involving natural disasters and other events such as blowouts, cratering, fire and explosion and loss of well control, which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to persons, loss of life, or damage to property and the environment. our international operations are also subject to political risk. the insurance coverage that we maintain against certain losses or liabilities arising from our operations may be inadequate to cover any such resulting liability; moreover, insurance is not available to us against all operational risks.
item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

apache corporation, a delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids. we currently have exploration and production interests in four countries: the u.s., canada, egypt, and the u.k. (north sea). apache also pursues exploration interests in other countries that may over time result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities.
during 2015, apache sold its australia lng business and oil and gas assets. during 2014, apache sold its operations in argentina. results of operations and cash flows from operations for argentina and australia are reflected as discontinued operations in the companys financial statements for all periods presented. certain historical information has been recast to reflect the results of operations for argentina and australia as discontinued operations.
the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k, and the risk factors and related information set forth in part i, item 1a and part ii, item 7a of this form 10-k.
overview of 2015 results this year was a transitional year for apache. we made significant progress high-grading our portfolio, reducing drilling activity, driving down costs, and proactively strengthening our financial condition.
we completed an extensive refocusing of the companys asset portfolio which began several years ago. through this process, we successfully monetized both capital intensive projects and assets that were not accretive to earnings in the near-term and other non-strategic assets. these divestitures included apaches interest in lng projects in australia and canada, its exploration and production operations in australia and argentina, and mature assets offshore in the gulf of mexico. proceeds from divestitures were used to improve our liquidity and redeployed to upgrade our portfolio.
we also reacted swiftly to the significant decline in crude oil prices that began in the third quarter of 2014 and continued throughout 2015 and into 2016. immediate action was taken to substantially reduce activity levels, and concrete steps were taken to cut overhead and operating costs. apaches intense focus on driving internal efficiencies, along with considerable downward pressure on third-party service costs, resulted in savings in both capital and operating costs. lease operating expenses and general and administrative expenses decreased 17 percent and 16 percent, respectively, from the prior year.
during the year, we also took action to strengthen our financial and liquidity position. the company reduced debt by $2.5 billion since year-end 2014 and exited the year with $1.5 billion of cash. our nearest long-term debt maturity is in 2018, and only $700 million, or 8 percent of our total debt portfolio, matures prior to 2021. in june 2015, we replaced $5.3 billion in revolving credit facilities with one $3.5 billion credit facility, which matures in june 2020.
daily production of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids averaged 535 mboe/d during 2015. excluding the impact of divested assets and the impact of egypt impairments and write-downs, production for the year would have increased 3 percent from 2014, despite a reduction of over 60 percent in capital spending. production volumes for 2015 included a nonrecurring downward adjustment of 9,649 boe/d related to egypt taxes. in the fourth quarter of 2015, we incurred charges totaling $1.3 billion for an impairment of certain gathering, transmission, and processing (gtp) assets and a write-down of oil and gas properties in egypt. these charges drove a significant loss in egypt for the fourth quarter, which mostly offset tax expense and tax volumes recognized in the first three quarters of the year. for more information regarding our production-sharing contracts and taxes, please refer to the geographic area overviews section set forth in part i, item 1 and 2 of this form 10-k.

in spite of these and other operating achievements, the precipitous decline in commodity prices negatively impacted our earnings and cash flow compared to the prior year. we reported a $23.1 billion loss attributable to common stock, or $61.20 per diluted common share, compared to a loss of $5.4 billion, or $14.06 per share in 2014. notable items impacting our earnings that were driven by the decline in commodity price and refocusing our asset portfolio include the following:

(1)   excludes egypt noncontrolling interest impact.

2016 outlook we believe our proactive actions taken in 2015 and previous years have positioned us to be flexible and rapid in our responses to the challenges faced in this difficult and unpredictable environment. we are prepared for a potentially lower for longer commodity price cycle, while retaining our ability to dynamically manage our activity levels as commodity price and service costs dictate. to ensure that we sustain this position, we have reduced our activity with a target of achieving cash flow neutrality. this means our capital program and dividends will be funded through cash from operations and a limited amount of non-core asset sales, without external financing.
we currently plan capital investments in 2016 in the range of $1.4 to $1.8 billion, a reduction of over 60 percent from 2015 levels. approximately $700 million to $800 million will be allocated to north american onshore plays, with the balance to international and u.s. offshore regions. this budget may be adjusted with commodity price movements throughout the year. our budgeted amounts exclude expenditures attributable to a one-third noncontrolling interest in egypt. our capital budget for 2016 has been, and will be, allocated on a prioritized basis as follows: (i) maintain assets and keeping them running efficiently and preserve mineral rights and leases, (ii) further optimize and build high quality inventory for the future, (iii) conduct certain medium-cycle, high impact exploration activities, and (iv) conduct limited-scale development activities that remain economically robust at these low prices. in addition, we will continue our overhead and lease operating expenses cost reduction efforts in order to position apache for an extended low commodity price environment.
given the further curtailment of capital spending, we are projecting a production decline of 7 percent to 11 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 production levels after adjusting for divestitures and volumes associated with egypts noncontrolling interest and tax impacts. however, we believe that if commodity prices improve from current market levels, we will be able to increase our capital plan accordingly with a greater focus on growth in our onshore north america assets.

operational highlights operational highlights for the year include:
north america
                                       north america onshore liquids averaged 193,483 barrels per day, with crude oil representing 69 percent of the liquids production. when adjusted for asset divestitures, this represents an increase of 4 percent compared to 2014. north america onshore liquids production represented 56 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 36 percent of our overall production.

                                                 the permian region averaged 12 operated rigs during the year, drilling 378 gross wells, 241 net wells. drilling activity in the region resulted in a production increase of 6 percent relative to the prior year. over half of the regions production is crude oil and 20 percent is ngls. combined, this represents more than a third of apaches total liquids production for 2015. the region averaged 168 mboe/d during 2015.

                                                        the midcontinent/gulf coast region averaged 5 operated rigs during the year, drilling 127 gross wells, 76 net wells. the region focused its drilling activities in the canyon lime, eagleford, marmaton, and woodford formations during 2015. apache is active in the scoop play in central oklahoma targeting the woodford formation, where we drilled or participated in drilling 33 wells. the region averaged 73 mboe/d during 2015.

                                                       the canada region averaged 2 operated rigs during the year, drilling 38 gross wells, 21 net wells. canada primarily focused on advancing growth plays in the duvernay and montney formations, with a goal of reducing drilling and completion costs. in the duvernay, we brought on-line our first seven-well pad under budget and at production levels that are exceeding our initial expectations. the region averaged 68 mboe/d during 2015.

international and offshore
                                            the egypt region significantly reduced its drilling program throughout the year, averaging 14 rigs and drilling 122 gross wells, 107 net wells.
despite the reduction, gross production, which is subject to the terms of production sharing contracts, increased 1 percent. egypts net production decreased 3 percent from 2014. development of the ptah and berenice oil fields continued to deliver excellent results, with nine new wells brought on-line and combined gross field production exceeding 26,000 b/d at its peak. the region averaged 145 net mboe/d during 2015.

                                                       the north sea region averaged 6 rigs, drilling 26 gross wells, 22 net wells. during the year, the region averaged production of 71 mboe/d. apache was able to maintain relatively flat production year over year despite a 21 percent reduction in capital expenditures. the 2015 drilling program was extremely successful and sets up excellent growth and profitability opportunities over the next five years. during the fourth quarter of 2015, apache announced five significant wells in the north sea: three exploration discoveries and two notable development wells.

exploration discoveries
   the k discovery, in the beryl area, is a significant oil discovery with multiple commercial zones across three distinct fault blocks, including one fault block with over 1,500 feet of net pay. apache is the operator of this discovery with a 55 percent working interest.

   the corona discovery, also located in the beryl area, logged 225 feet total vertical depth net pay in excellent reservoir-quality sandstone. apache has a 100 percent working interest in this discovery.

32
                                                      the seagull discovery confirmed 672 feet of net oil pay over a 1,092-foot column in triassic-age sands. the well was flow tested with a facility-constrained rate of 8.7 mb/d of oil and 16 million cubic feet of natural gas per day (mmcf/d) with a very low pressure drawdown. further appraisal work will continue following the recent acquisition of a multi-azimuth 3-d survey.
apache has a 35 percent working interest in this project and is now operator of this license.

notable development wells
                                                       apache drilled two significant development wells in the beryl area, which apache operates. apache owns a 60.55 percent working interest in both wells. the acn development well came online in october at a test rate of 11 mb/d of oil and 30.4 mmcf/d of natural gas. the l4s pilot well started production in july and had an initial production rate of 2 mb/d of oil and 45 mmcf/d of natural gas.

acquisition and divestiture activity over apaches 60-year history, we have repeatedly demonstrated our ability to capitalize quickly and decisively on changes in our industry and economic conditions. a key component of this strategy is to continuously review and optimize our portfolio of assets in response to changes. most recently and prior to the precipitous decline of commodity prices beginning in 2014, apache closed, or had agreements executed, on a series of divestitures designed to monetize nonstrategic assets and enhance our portfolio. these divestments comprised primarily capital intensive projects and assets that were not accretive to earnings in the near-term, and included all of our operations in australia and argentina. these divestments include:
                                                               australia operations on june 5, 2015, apaches subsidiaries completed the sale of the companys australian subsidiary apache energy limited to a consortium of private equity funds managed by macquarie capital group limited and brookfield asset management inc. for total proceeds of $1.9 billion (net of $225 million in customary, post-closing adjustments for the period between the effective date, october 1, 2014, and closing). additionally, in october 2015, apaches subsidiaries completed the sale of its 49 percent interest in yara pilbara holdings pty ltd (yphpl), to yara international for total proceeds of $391 million. the effective date of the transaction was january 1, 2015.

                      lng projects on april 2, 2015 and april 10, 2015, apache subsidiaries completed the sale of its interest in the wheatstone lng and kitimat lng projects, respectively, along with accompanying upstream oil and gas reserves to woodside petroleum limited for a total cash consideration of $3.7 billion.

                                                          nonstrategic assets in the anadarko basin and in southern louisiana on december 31, 2014, apache completed the sale of certain anadarko basin and southern louisiana oil and gas assets for approximately $1.3 billion in two separate transactions. in the anadarko basin, apache sold approximately 115,000 net acres in wheeler county, texas, and western oklahoma. in southern louisiana, the company sold working interests in approximately 90,000 net acres. the effective date of both of these transactions was october 1, 2014.

                           certain gulf of mexico deepwater assets on june 30, 2014, apache completed the sale of non-operated interests in the lucius and heidelberg development projects and 11 primary term deepwater exploration blocks in the gulf of mexico for $1.4 billion. the effective date of the transaction was may 1, 2014.

crude oil prices a substantial portion of our crude oil production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of the companys control. average realized crude oil prices for 2015 were down 47 percent compared to 2014, a direct result of the sharply lower benchmark oil prices over the past year.
continued volatility in the commodity price environment reinforces the importance of our asset portfolio. while the market price received for natural gas varies among geographic areas, crude oil tends to trade within a tighter global range. price movements for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction. crude oil prices realized in 2015 averaged $48.17 per barrel.
natural gas prices natural gas, which currently has a limited global transportation system, is subject to price variances based on local supply and demand conditions. our primary markets include north america, egypt, and the u.k. an overview of the market conditions in our primary gas-producing regions follows:
   north america has a common market; most of our gas is sold on a monthly or daily basis at either monthly or daily market prices. our north american regions averaged $2.39 per mcf in 2015, down from $4.24 per mcf in 2014.

                        in egypt, our gas is sold to egpc, primarily under an industry pricing formula indexed to dated brent crude oil with a minimum gas price of $1.50
per mmbtu and a maximum gas price of $2.65 per mmbtu, plus an upward adjustment for liquids content. overall, the region averaged $2.92 per mcf in 2015, down 1 percent from the prior year.

                            natural gas from the north sea beryl field is processed through the sage gas plant operated by apache. the gas is sold to a third party at the st.
fergus entry point of the national grid on a national balancing point index price basis. the region averaged $6.73 per mcf in 2015, a 19 percent decrease from an average of $8.29 per mcf in 2014.

ngl prices apaches ngl production is sold under contracts with prices at market indices based on local supply and demand conditions, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser.
crude oil revenues
2015 vs. 2014   during 2015 crude oil revenues totaled $5.0 billion, approximately 50 percent lower than the 2014 total of $10.0 billion, driven by a 47 percent decrease in average crude oil prices and a 5 percent decrease in worldwide production. average daily production in 2015 was 284.4 mb/d, with prices averaging $48.17 per barrel. crude oil represented 78 percent of our 2015 oil and gas production revenues and 53 percent of our equivalent production, compared to 79 and 51 percent, respectively, in the prior year. lower realized prices reduced revenues $4.8 billion, while lower production volumes reduced revenues an additional $273 million.
worldwide crude oil production from continuing operations decreased 15.5 mb/d. when excluding production from asset divestitures during 2015 and 2014, crude oil production remained essentially flat as drilling and recompletion activity in our north american onshore regions offset natural decline in all regions.
2014 vs. 2013   during 2014 crude oil revenues totaled $10.0 billion, $1.8 billion lower than the 2013 total of $11.9 billion, driven by a 6 percent decrease in worldwide production and 10 percent decrease in average realized prices. average daily production in 2014 was 300.0 mb/d, with prices averaging $91.73 per barrel.
38
crude oil represented 79 percent of our 2014 oil and gas production revenues and 51 percent of our equivalent production, compared to 80 and 48 percent, respectively, in the prior year. lower realized prices reduced revenues $1.2 billion, while lower production volumes reduced revenues $604 million.
worldwide crude oil production from continuing operations decreased 18.0 mb/d, however, when excluding production from asset divestitures during 2014 and 2013, crude oil production increased 17.0 mb/d. this increase was driven by production growth of 20.1 mb/d in our permian region as a result of higher drilling and recompletion activity, partially offset by a decrease in production from the north sea on natural decline.
natural gas revenues
2015 vs. 2014   natural gas revenues of $1.2 billion for 2015 were $826 million lower than 2014, the result of a 31 percent decrease in realized prices and a 16 percent decrease in production volumes. worldwide production decreased 209.4 mmcf/d, lowering revenues by $214 million. realized prices in 2015 averaged $2.80 per mcf, a decrease of $1.25 per mcf compared to 2014, which decreased revenues by $612 million.
worldwide gas production from continuing operations decreased 16 percent. excluding production from asset divestitures during 2015 and 2014, gas production decreased only 1 percent. this decrease was driven primarily by natural decline and well shut-ins in egypt and canada. this decrease was primarily offset by drilling and recompletion activity in north america onshore regions.
2014 vs. 2013   natural gas revenues of $2.0 billion for 2014 were $283 million lower than 2013, the result of a 21 percent decrease in production volumes offset by a 10 percent increase in realized prices. worldwide production decreased 345.9 mmcf/d, lowering revenues by $511.8 million. realized prices in 2014 averaged $4.05 per mcf, an increase of $0.37 per mcf from 2013, which increased revenues by $229 million.
worldwide gas production from continuing operations decreased 21 percent. however, excluding production from asset divestitures during 2015 and 2014, gas production increased 14.2 mmcf/d. this increase was driven by production growth of 28.0 mmcf/d in the permian region as a result of higher drilling and recompletion activity. egypts net production increased 13.8 mmcf/d as a result of our successful drilling program with new wells coming on-line during 2014, and production from the north sea increased 5 mmcf/d on stronger than expected well performance.
ngl revenues
2015 vs. 2014 ngl revenues totaled $227 million in 2015, a decrease of $441 million from 2014, the result of a 7 percent decrease in production volumes and a 63 percent decrease in realized prices. worldwide production from continuing operations decreased 4.8 mb/d, reducing revenues by $17 million. realized prices in 2015 averaged $9.98 per barrel, a decrease of $17.30 per barrel, which reduced revenues by $424 million.
2014 vs. 2013 ngl revenues totaled $668 million in 2014, an increase of $16 million from 2013, the result of a 7 percent increase in production volumes partially offset by a 4 percent decrease in realized prices. worldwide production from continuing operations increased 4.5 mb/d, which added $44.9 million to revenues. this increase was primarily driven by drilling and recompletion activity in our north american onshore regions. realized prices in 2014 averaged $27.28 per barrel, a decrease of $1.28 per barrel, which reduced revenues by $29.4 million.

2015 vs. 2014   oil and gas property recurring dd&a expense of $3.5 billion in 2015 decreased $857 million compared to 2014. the companys oil and gas property recurring dd&a rate decreased $2.28 per boe in 2015 compared to 2014. the primary factor driving both lower absolute dollar expense and lower dd&a per boe rates was the reduction in the companys oil and gas property carrying values resulting from significant property write-downs incurred during 2015.
2014 vs. 2013   recurring full-cost depletion expense decreased $146 million on an absolute dollar basis: $412 million on lower volumes partially offset by an increase of $266 million from a higher average cost rate per boe. our full-cost depletion rate increased $1.58 to $20.36 per boe reflecting increased cost for exploration and development activity over the prior years.
additional dd&a under the full-cost method of accounting, the company is required to review the carrying value of its proved oil and gas properties each quarter on a country-by-country basis. under these rules, capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, net of accumulated dd&a and deferred income taxes, may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, net of related tax effects and discounted 10 percent per annum and adjusted for cash flow hedges. estimated future net cash flows are calculated using end-of-period costs and an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements.

apache recorded non-cash after-tax write-downs of its proved oil and gas properties totaling $16.6 billion, $3.1 billion, and $541 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. the following table reflects write-downs by country:

in 2013, the company recorded a non-cash write-down of $118 million, net of tax, in argentina, which is reflected as discontinued operations in the companys consolidated financial statements.
if commodity prices do not recover significantly from current levels, the company expects further write-downs of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties as the full cost ceiling limitation was calculated using a historical 12-month pricing average that included commodity prices from 2015. these prices were significantly higher than current commodity futures prices. to estimate the full cost ceiling limitation for 2016, had the company utilized commodity futures prices as of december 31, 2015 in lieu of using historical commodity prices to calculate the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average price, the write-down as of december 31, 2015 would have been higher by $4.3 billion ($3.0 billion net of tax).
lease operating expenses (loe)
loe includes several key components, such as direct operating costs, repair and maintenance, and workover costs. direct operating costs generally trend with commodity prices and are impacted by the type of commodity produced and the location of properties (i.e., offshore, onshore, remote locations, etc.). fluctuations in commodity prices impact operating cost elements both directly and indirectly. they directly impact costs such as power, fuel, and chemicals, which are commodity price based. commodity prices also affect industry activity and demand, thus indirectly impacting the cost of items such as rig rates, labor, boats, helicopters, materials, and supplies. oil, which contributed more than half of our 2015 production, is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. repair and maintenance costs are typically higher on offshore properties.
during 2015, loe decreased $384 million, or 17 percent, on an absolute dollar basis compared to 2014. on a per-unit basis, loe decreased $0.90, or 9 percent compared to 2014. during 2014, loe decreased $412 million, or 16 percent, on an absolute dollar basis compared to 2013. on a per-unit basis, loe decreased $0.58, or 5 percent, compared to 2013. these reductions reflect our continued focus on cost reductions consistent with the current price environment.
gathering and transportation we generally sell oil and natural gas under two common types of agreements, both of which include a transportation charge. one is a netback arrangement, under which we sell oil or natural gas at the wellhead and collect a lower relative price to reflect transportation costs to be incurred by the purchaser. in this case, we record sales at the netback price received from the purchaser. alternatively, we sell oil or natural gas at a specific delivery point, pay our own transportation to a third-party carrier, and receive a price with no transportation deduction. in this case, we record the separate transportation cost as gathering and transportation costs.
41
in the u.s. and canada we sell oil and natural gas under both types of arrangements. in the north sea, we pay transportation charges to a third-party carrier. in egypt, our oil and natural gas production is primarily sold to egpc under netback arrangements; however, we also export crude oil under both types of arrangements.
2015 vs. 2014   gathering and transportation costs decreased $62 million from 2014. the decrease was driven primarily by north american onshore divestitures.
2014 vs. 2013   gathering and transportation costs decreased $15 million from 2013. canadas 2014 costs decreased $32 million from a decline in production primarily associated with divestitures. the u.s. costs for 2014 increased $9 million as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of increased production in the midcontinent/gulf coast and permian regions from increased drilling activity partially offset by a decrease from the gulf of mexico asset sales. egypt costs were down $2 million from decreases in the world scale freight rates. north sea costs increased $10 million on increased ngl activity and oil transportation tariffs.
taxes other than income taxes other than income primarily consist of u.k. petroleum revenue tax (prt), severance taxes on properties onshore and in state or provincial waters off the coast of the u.s., and ad valorem taxes on properties in the u.s. and canada. severance taxes are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues, while the u.k. prt is assessed on net receipts from qualifying fields in the u.k. north sea. we are subject to a variety of other taxes including u.s. franchise taxes and various canadian taxes, including the freehold mineral tax and saskatchewan resources surtax. the table below presents a comparison of these expenses:

2015 vs. 2014   taxes other than income were $295 million lower than 2014. u.k. prt decreased $118 million over the comparable 2014 period as the result of decreased production revenues in the north sea from qualifying fields during the year. severance tax decreased $138 million as the result of lower revenues and the divestiture of properties in louisiana and oklahoma. ad valorem taxes decreased $27 million as a result of property divestitures. in 2015, the u.k. government enacted finance bill 2015, which provides tax relief to exploration and production (e&p) companies operating in the north sea. effective january 1, 2016, the u.k. prt rate is reduced from 50 percent to 35 percent.
2014 vs. 2013   taxes other than income were $195 million lower than 2013. u.k. prt decreased $196 million over the comparable 2013 period based on a decrease in production revenues in the north sea from qualifying fields during the year. severance tax increased $2 million with increased production from the permian region offset by higher tax credits and decreased commodity prices.
impairments during 2015, the company recorded asset impairments totaling $1.9 billion in connection with fair value assessments in the current low commodity price environment, including $1.7 billion for the impairment of gathering, transmission, and processing (gtp) facilities, $148 million for the impairment of our yphpl equity method investment sold in the fourth quarter, and $55 million for inventory write-downs. gtp impairments included $555 million ($410 million net of tax) for facilities in canada, $102 million in the u.s. ($66 million net
42
of tax), and $1.1 billion in egypt. the egyptian impairments resulted in net losses for the year in the applicable concessions, significantly reducing tax expense recorded under our production-sharing contracts.
during 2014, the company recorded asset impairments totaling $1.9 billion in connection with fair value assessments, including $1.3 billion for the impairment of goodwill, $604 million for the impairment of assets held for sale, and other asset impairments. the company had also recorded $439 million in impairments related to the sale of australias assets, which are classified as discontinued operations in 2014.
general and administrative (g&a) expenses
2015 vs. 2014   g&a expenses decreased $74 million, or 16 percent, from 2014. on a per-unit basis, g&a expenses decreased $0.16 to $1.93 per boe. these reductions reflect apaches intense focus on driving internal efficiencies and bringing overhead in line with the current commodity price environment. in 2015, we rationalized our entire organizational structure, eliminating layers of management, consolidating office locations, and reducing corporate and regional staffing to more closely align with activity levels expected in the future.
2014 vs. 2013   g&a expenses decreased $30 million, or 6 percent, from 2013. on a per-unit basis, g&a expenses increased $0.10 to $2.09 per boe, with the benefit of lower costs partially offset by the impact of lower production.
transaction, reorganization, and separation costs apache recorded $132 million, $67 million and $33 million of expenses during 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, primarily related to divestiture activity and company reorganization, including separation costs, investment banking fees and other associated costs. the charges for 2015 include $53 million for employee separation cost; $42 million associated with office closings, consolidation of office space in houston, and other reorganization efforts; and $36 million related to the australia divestiture and other transactions.
financing costs, net financing costs incurred during the period comprised the following:

2015 vs. 2014   net financing costs increased $88 million from 2014. the increase is primarily related to a decrease of $60 million in capitalized interest from lower asset balances qualifying for capitalized interest and a $39 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt during 2015, partially offset by a decrease of $13 million in interest expense resulting from lower average debt balances.
2014 vs. 2013   net financing costs decreased $18 million from 2013. the decrease is primarily related to a $61 million decrease in interest expense as a result of lower average debt balances during 2014, partially offset by a $28 million decrease in capitalized interest resulting from lower property balances and a $16 million gain on extinguishment of debt in 2013.

provision for income taxes in 2015, apache repatriated the sales proceeds from the divestment of its interest in lng projects and australian upstream assets. upon the repatriation of these proceeds, apache recognized a u.s. current income tax liability of $560 million. pursuant to its plan of divestiture of these assets, apache recorded a deferred income tax liability of $560 million on undistributed foreign earnings in 2014.
the 2015 income tax benefit from continuing operations totaled $5.5 billion. the deferred tax position in the u.s. changed from a net deferred tax liability as of december 31, 2014 to a net deferred tax asset as of december 31, 2015 as a result of $19.5 billion in non-cash ceiling test write-downs and the recognition of $2.1 billion of deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credit carryforwards. the 2015 effective tax rate reflects an increase in valuation allowance against the u.s. and canadian regions net deferred tax assets. separately, the u.k. government enacted finance bill 2015 that provides income tax relief to e&p companies operating in the north sea through a reduction of supplementary charge from 32 percent to 20 percent, effective january 1, 2015. as a result of the enacted legislation, in 2015, apache recorded a deferred tax benefit of $619 million related to the remeasurement of the companys december 31, 2014 u.k. deferred income tax liability.
the 2014 provision for income taxes from continuing operations totaled $663 million. the 2014 effective rate reflects the tax benefit from the $5.0 billion non-cash ceiling test write-down in the u.s. and north sea. the companys rate is also impacted by the $560 million of deferred income tax expense recorded in 2014 for changing our position on undistributed earnings on foreign subsidiaries and $311 million of deferred income tax expense on distributed foreign earnings. in addition, the company had approximately $1.9 billion of impairments related to non-cash write-downs of goodwill and assets held for sale which impact the effective tax rate.
for additional information regarding income taxes, please refer to note 7income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.
capital resources and liquidity operating cash flows are the companys primary source of liquidity. we may also elect to utilize available cash on hand, committed borrowing capacity, access to both debt and equity capital markets, or proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic assets for all other liquidity and capital resource needs.
apaches operating cash flows, both in the short-term and the long-term, are impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices, as well as costs and sales volumes. significant changes in commodity prices impact our revenues, earnings and cash flows. these changes potentially impact our liquidity if costs do not trend with changes in commodity prices. historically, costs have trended with commodity prices, albeit on a lag. sales volumes also impact cash flows; however, they have a less volatile impact in the short-term.
deterioration in commodity prices also impacts estimated quantities of proved reserves. during 2015, we recognized negative reserve revisions of approximately 15 percent of our year-end 2014 estimated proved reserves as a result of lower prices. if realized prices for the remainder of 2016 approximate commodity future prices as of december 31, 2015, the company is reasonably likely to report additional negative revisions, currently estimated at eight to ten percent of year-end 2015 estimated proved reserves.
apaches long-term operating cash flows are dependent on reserve replacement and the level of costs required for ongoing operations. cash investments are required to fund activity necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proved crude oil and natural gas reserves. future success in maintaining and growing reserves and production is highly dependent on the success of our drilling program and our ability to add reserves economically.
we currently plan capital investments in 2016 in the range of $1.4 to $1.8 billion, a reduction of over 60 percent from 2015 levels. approximately $700 million to $800 million will be allocated to north american onshore plays, with the balance to international and u.s. offshore regions. this budget may be adjusted with
44
commodity price movements throughout the year. our budgeted amounts exclude expenditures attributable to a one-third non-controlling interest in egypt. our capital budget for 2016 has been, and will be, allocated on a prioritized basis as follows: (i) maintain assets and keeping them running efficiently and preserve mineral rights and leases, (ii) further optimize and build high quality inventory for the future, (iii) conduct certain medium-cycle, high impact exploration activities, and (iv) conduct limited-scale development activities that remain economically robust at these low prices. in addition, we will continue our overhead and loe cost reduction efforts in order to position apache for an extended low commodity price environment.
we believe the liquidity and capital resource alternatives available to apache, combined with proactive measures to adjust our capital budget to reflect lower commodity prices and anticipated operating cash flows, will be adequate to fund short-term and long-term operations, including our capital spending program, repayment of debt maturities, payment of dividends, and any amount that may ultimately be paid in connection with commitments and contingencies.

net cash provided by continuing operating activities operating cash flows are our primary source of capital and liquidity and are impacted, both in the short-term and the long-term, by volatile oil and natural gas prices. the factors that determine operating cash flows are largely the same as those that affect net earnings, with the exception of non-cash expenses such as dd&a, asset retirement obligation (aro) accretion, oil and gas property write-downs, asset impairments, and deferred income tax expense, which affect earnings but do not affect cash flows.
net cash provided by continuing operating activities for 2015 totaled $2.8 billion, down $4.7 billion from 2014. the decrease primarily reflects lower commodity prices and divestitures.
for a detailed discussion of commodity prices, production, and expenses, please see results of operations in this item 7. for additional detail on the changes in operating assets and liabilities and the non-cash expenses which do not impact net cash provided by operating activities, please see the statement of consolidated cash flows in the consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.
australia discontinued operations during 2015, apache completed the sale of its wheatstone lng project and associated upstream assets to woodside for total proceeds of $2.8 billion. during 2015, apache also completed the sale of its australian subsidiary ael to a consortium of private equity funds managed by macquarie capital group limited and brookfield asset management inc. for total proceeds of $1.9 billion. the results of operations for the divested australian assets and losses on disposal are classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this annual report on form 10-k. in addition, apache sold its 49 percent interest equity method investment in yphpl for total cash proceeds of $391 million.
argentina discontinued operations during 2014, apache completed the sale of our argentina operations and properties to ypf sociedad anónima for cash proceeds of $800 million (subject to customary closing adjustments). the results of operations related to argentina have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this annual report on form 10-k. net cash provided by argentina discontinued operations for the first quarter of 2014 was $2 million.
asset divestitures during 2015, 2014, and 2013, apache had proceeds from divestitures totaling $1.1 billion, $3.1 billion, and $4.4 billion, respectively. for information regarding our acquisitions and divestitures, please see note 2acquisitions and divestitures in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.
egypt noncontrolling interest during 2013, apache completed the sale of a one-third minority participation in its egypt oil and gas business to sinopec for $2.95 billion. apache made cash distributions totaling $129 million and $140 million to sinopec in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
capital expenditures during 2015, capital spending for exploration and development (e&d) activities totaled $4.6 billion compared to $9.0 billion in the prior year. apaches e&d capital spending was primarily focused on our north american onshore region, where apache operated an average of 19 drilling rigs. apaches investment in gas gathering, transmission, and processing facilities totaled $233 million and $881 million during 2015 and 2014, respectively. apaches investment in gtp was primarily for the kitimat lng project, which was divested in the second quarter of 2015.
46
apache also completed leasehold and property acquisitions totaling $367 million during 2015, compared with $1.5 billion in 2014. our acquisition investments continued to focus on adding new leasehold positions to our north american onshore portfolio.
shares repurchased apaches board of directors has authorized the purchase of up to 40 million shares of the companys common stock. shares may be purchased either in the open market or through privately held negotiated transactions. the company initiated the buyback program on june 10, 2013, and through december 31, 2014, had repurchased a total of 32.2 million shares at an average price of $88.96 per share. the company has not purchased any additional shares during 2015 and is not obligated to acquire any specific number of shares.
dividends the company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for 51 consecutive years through 2015. future dividend payments will depend on the companys level of earnings, financial requirements, and other relevant factors. common stock dividends paid during 2015 totaled $377 million, compared with $365 million in 2014 and $303 million in 2013. the company paid dividends on its series d preferred stock totaling $57 million in 2013. the preferred stock was converted to common stock in august 2013.

cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2015, we had $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which $1.1 billion of cash was held by foreign subsidiaries, and approximately $382 million was held by apache corporation and u.s. subsidiaries. the cash held by foreign subsidiaries should not be subject to additional u.s. income taxes if repatriated. the majority of the cash is invested in highly liquid, investment-grade securities with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.
debt at december 31, 2015, outstanding debt, which consisted of notes and debentures, totaled $8.8 billion. we have $550 million maturing in 2018, $150 million maturing in 2019, and the remaining $8.1 billion maturing in years 2021 through 2096. at december 31, 2015, we had $416,000 of notes due june 2016 classified as current debt on the consolidated balance sheet.
in september 2015, the company fully redeemed its $500 million 5.625% notes due in 2017 and its $400 million 1.75% notes due in 2017. the notes were redeemed pursuant to the provisions of each respective notes indenture. apache paid the holders an aggregate of $939 million in cash reflecting principal and the premium to par, and an additional $8 million in accrued and unpaid interest.
available credit facilities in june 2015, the company entered into a five-year revolving credit facility which matures in june 2020, subject to apaches two, one-year extension options. the facility provides for aggregate commitments of $3.5 billion (including a $750 million letter of credit subfacility), with rights to increase commitments up to an
47
aggregate $4.5 billion. proceeds from borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes. apaches available borrowing capacity under this facility supports its commercial paper program. in connection with entry into the $3.5 billion facility, apache terminated $5.3 billion in commitments under existing credit facilities. as of december 31, 2015, aggregate available borrowing capacity under this credit facility was $3.5 billion.
at the companys option, the interest rate per annum for borrowings under the facility is either a base rate, as defined, plus a margin, or the london inter-bank offered rate (libor), plus a margin. at december 31, 2015 the margin over libor was 1.0 percent. the company also pays quarterly a facility fee at a per annum rate on total commitments, which at december 31, 2015 was 0.125 percent on the total $3.5 billion in commitments. the margins and the facility fee vary based upon the companys senior long-term debt rating. as a result of recent ratings downgrades, the base rate margin is 0.075 percent, the libor margin is 1.075 percent, and the facility fee is 0.175 percent as of the date of filing this report.
the financial covenants of the credit facility require the company to maintain an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. for purposes of this calculation, capital excludes the effects of non-cash write-downs, impairments, and related charges occurring after june 30, 2015. at december 31, 2015, the companys debt-to-capital ratio as calculated under the credit facility was 34 percent.
negative covenants restrict the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to create liens securing debt on its hydrocarbon-related assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens, liens on subsidiary assets located outside of the united states and canada, and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics liens. the company also may incur liens on assets if debt secured thereby does not exceed 5 percent of the companys consolidated assets, or approximately $940 million as of december 31, 2015. negative covenants also restrict apaches ability to merge with another entity unless it is the surviving entity, dispose of substantially all of its assets, and guarantee debt of non-consolidated entities in excess of the stated threshold.
there are no clauses in the facility that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes. the credit facility agreement does not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings. however, the agreement allows the lenders to accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending commitments for nonpayment and other breaches, and if the company or any of its u.s. or canadian subsidiaries defaults on other indebtedness in excess of the stated threshold, is insolvent, or has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it for payment of money in excess of the stated threshold. lenders may also accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending commitments if the company undergoes a specified change in control or any borrower has specified pension plan liabilities in excess of the stated threshold. the company was in compliance with the terms of the credit facility as of december 31, 2015.
in february 2016, apache entered into a three-year letter of credit facility providing £900 million in commitments, with options to increase commitments to £1.075 billion and extend the term by one year. the facility is available for letters of credit and loans to cash collateralize letter of credit obligations to the extent letters of credit are unavailable under the facility. the facilitys representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default are substantially similar to those in apaches $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. commissions are payable on outstanding letters of credit and borrowings bear interest (at a base rate or libor), plus a margin. letter of credit commissions, the interest margin, and the facility fee vary depending on apaches senior unsecured long-term debt rating. the company has not requested any letters of credit or borrowings under this facility as of the date of this filing. this facility is available for the companys letter of credit needs, particularly those which may arise in respect of abandonment obligations assumed in various north sea acquisitions.
there is no assurance that the financial condition of banks with lending commitments to the company will not deteriorate. we closely monitor the ratings of the banks in our bank groups. having large bank groups allows the company to mitigate the potential impact of any banks failure to honor its lending commitment.
commercial paper program as of december 31, 2015, the company has available a $3.5 billion commercial paper program. the commercial paper program generally enables apache to borrow funds for up to 270 days at competitive interest
48
rates. the commercial paper program is fully supported by available borrowing capacity under the companys 2015 $3.5 billion committed credit facility. if the company is unable to issue commercial paper following a significant credit downgrade or dislocation in the market, the companys 2015 committed credit facility, which expires in 2020, is available as a 100 percent backstop. as of december 31, 2015, the company had no borrowings under its commercial paper program, bank facility, or uncommitted bank lines.
off-balance sheet arrangements apache enters into customary agreements in the oil and gas industry for drilling rig commitments, firm transportation agreements, and other obligations as described below in contractual obligations in this item 7. other than the off-balance sheet arrangements described herein, apache does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or capital resource positions.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the companys contractual obligations as of december 31, 2015. for additional information regarding these obligations, please see note 6debt and note 8commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.

(1)                                                 this table does not include the companys liability for dismantlement, abandonment, and restoration costs of oil and gas properties or pension or postretirement benefit obligations. for additional information regarding these liabilities, please see notes 5 and 9, respectively, in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.

(2)                   this represents minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. apaches expenditures for drilling rig services will exceed such minimum amounts to the extent apache utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract.

(3)                                                     purchase obligations represent agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, are legally binding, and specify all significant terms, including fixed and minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the appropriate timing of the transaction. these include minimum commitments associated with take-or-pay contracts, ngl processing agreements, and drilling work program commitments.

(4)   firm transportation commitments relate to contractual obligations for capacity rights on third-party pipelines.

(5)   other operating lease obligations pertain to other long-term exploration, development, and production activities. the company has work-related commitments for supply and standby vessels, gas pipeline and land leases.

apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur. the inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess settlements resulting from litigation. apaches management feels that it has adequately reserved for its contingent
49
obligations, including approximately $52 million for environmental remediation and approximately $29 million for various contingent legal liabilities. for a detailed discussion of the companys environmental and legal contingencies, please see note 8commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.
in addition to our recorded environmental and legal liabilities, we have potential exposure to future obligations related to divested properties. apache has divested various leases, wells, and facilities located in the gulf of mexico where the purchasers typically assume all obligations to plug, abandon, and decommission the associated wells, structures, and facilities acquired. one or more of the counterparties in these transactions could, either as a result of the severe decline in oil and natural gas prices or other factors related to the historical or future operations of their respective businesses, face financial problems that may have a significant impact on its solvency and ability to continue as a going concern. if a purchaser of our gulf of mexico assets becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant insolvency laws or otherwise fails to perform required abandonment obligations, apache could be required to perform such actions under applicable federal laws and regulations. in such event, we may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise.
with respect to our retained oil and gas operations in the gulf of mexico, the bureau of ocean energy management (boem) is currently planning to issue a new notice to lessees (ntl) significantly revising the obligations of companies operating in the gulf of mexico to provide supplemental assurances of performance with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations associated with wells, platforms, structures, and facilities. we currently expect such new ntl may require apache to provide additional security to the boem with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations relating to apaches current ownership interests in various gulf of mexico leases. we are working closely with the boem to make arrangements for the provision of such additional required security, if such security becomes necessary under the new ntl. additionally, we are not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which apache has sold gulf of mexico assets. such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially, thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties solvency and ability to continue as a going concern.
insurance program we maintain insurance policies that include coverage for physical damage to our assets, third party liability, workers compensation, employers liability, sudden and accidental pollution, and other risks. our insurance coverage includes deductibles or retentions that must be met prior to recovery. additionally, our insurance is subject to policy exclusions and limitations, and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages.
our current insurance policies covering physical damage to our assets provide $1 billion in coverage per occurrence. these policies also provide sudden and accidental pollution coverage. coverage for gulf of mexico named windstorms is excluded from this coverage.
our current insurance policies covering general liabilities provide approximately $500 million in coverage, scaled to apaches interest, subject to a retention that must be met prior to recovery. this coverage is in excess of any existing policies, including, but not limited to, aircraft liability and automobile liability. our service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally indemnify apache for injuries and death of the service providers employees as well as subcontractors hired by the service provider.
apache purchases multi-year political risk insurance from the overseas private investment corporation (opic) and other highly rated international insurers covering a portion of its investments in egypt for losses arising from confiscation, nationalization, and expropriation risks. the islamic corporation for the insurance of investment and export credit (iciec, an agency of the islamic development bank) reinsures opic. in the aggregate, these insurance policies, subject to the policy terms and conditions, provide approximately $750 million of coverage to apache, subject to a self-insured retention of approximately $1 billion.
50
in addition, apache has a separate policy with opic, which, subject to policy terms and conditions, provides $300 million of coverage through 2024 for losses arising from (1) non-payment by egpc of arbitral awards covering amounts owed apache on past due invoices and (2) expropriation of exportable petroleum in the event that actions taken by the government of egypt prevent apache from exporting our share of production. the multilateral investment guarantee agency (miga), a member of the world bank group, provides $150 million in reinsurance to opic.
future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. in addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable.
critical accounting policies and estimates apache prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. apache identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of apaches financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity, and complexity in their deployment. critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. management routinely discusses the development, selection, and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. the following is a discussion of apaches most critical accounting policies.
reserves estimates proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing conditions, operating conditions, and government regulations.
proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time.
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. for example, since we use the units-of-production method to amortize our oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our dd&a expense. our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves. finally, these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures.
reserves are calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements.
apache has elected not to disclose probable and possible reserves or reserve estimates in this filing.
asset retirement obligation (aro)
the company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. apaches removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms in the north sea and gulf of mexico. estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments. asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety, and public relations considerations.
51
aro associated with retiring tangible long-lived assets is recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and becomes determinable. the liability is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset. the aro liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with apaches oil and gas properties. the company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations. inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental, and political environments. to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing aro liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance. accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value.
income taxes our oil and gas exploration and production operations are subject to taxation on income in numerous jurisdictions worldwide. we record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets. if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices).
the company regularly assesses and, if required, establishes accruals for tax contingencies that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where the company operates. tax reserves have been established and include any related interest, despite the belief by the company that certain tax positions meet certain legislative, judicial, and regulatory requirements. these reserves are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law, and any new legislation. the company believes that the reserves established are adequate in relation to the potential for any additional tax assessments.
purchase price allocation accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities. any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
the purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value. estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired companys assets and liabilities and tax-related carryforwards at the merger date, although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known. the amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed relative to the total acquisition cost.
in estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we made various assumptions. the most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved crude oil and natural gas properties. to estimate the fair values of these properties, we prepared estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves as described above in reserve estimates of this item 7. estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future.

possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. if there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is monitored by management through an established process where changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes, and future development plans are reviewed. if, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants. the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, and capital decisions, considering all available information at the date of review.
during 2015, there was a substantial decline in commodity prices. the resulting change in future commodity price assumptions and plan for cash was a triggering event which required us to reassess our long-lived assets for impairment. based on the results of this assessment, we recorded impairments of certain gathering, transmission, and processing facilities. for discussion of these impairments, see fair value measurements of note 1summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
goodwill as of december 31, 2015, the companys consolidated balance sheet included $87 million of goodwill, all of which has been assigned to the egypt reporting unit. goodwill is assessed at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level. we conduct a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment as of july 1st of each year, and whenever impairment indicators arise, by examining relevant events and circumstances which could have a negative impact on our goodwill such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, overall financial performance, acquisitions and divestitures, and other relevant entity-specific events.
the first step of the impairment test requires management to make estimates regarding the fair value of each reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned. if it is necessary to determine the fair value of the reporting unit, we use a combination of the income approach and the market approach.
under the income approach, the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows. the income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of forecasted revenue and operating costs, proved reserves, the success of future exploration for and development of unproved reserves, discount rates, and other variables. negative revisions of estimated reserves quantities, increases in future cost estimates, divestiture of a significant component of the reporting unit, or sustained decreases in crude oil or natural gas prices could lead to a reduction in expected future cash flows and possibly an impairment of all or a portion of goodwill in future periods.
key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model described above include estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves, including both proved reserves and risk-adjusted unproved reserves; estimates of market prices considering forward commodity price curves as of the measurement date; and estimates of operating, administrative, and capital costs adjusted for inflation. we discount the resulting future cash flows using discount rates similar to those used by the company in the valuation of acquisitions and divestitures.
to assess the reasonableness of our fair value estimate, we use a market approach to compare the fair value to similar businesses whose securities are actively traded in the public market. this requires management to make certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies, recent comparable asset transactions, and transaction premiums. associated market multiples are applied to various financial metrics of the reporting unit to estimate fair value.

although we base the fair value estimate of each reporting unit on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, those assumptions are inherently unpredictable and uncertain, and actual results could differ from the estimate. in the event of a prolonged global recession, commodity prices may stay depressed or decline further, thereby causing the fair value of the reporting unit to decline, which could result in an impairment of goodwill.
no goodwill impairment was recognized during 2015. during the fourth quarter of 2014, the company recognized non-cash impairments of the entire amount of recorded goodwill in the u.s., north sea, and canada reporting units of $1.0 billion, $163 million, and $103 million, respectively.

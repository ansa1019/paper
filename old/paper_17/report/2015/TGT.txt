item 1a.    risk factors our business is subject to many risks. set forth below are the material risks that we face. for the convenience of the reader, the risks are listed in the categories where those risks primarily apply, but they may also apply to other categories.
competitive and reputational risks our continued success is dependent on positive perceptions of target which, if eroded, could adversely affect our business and our relationships with our guests and team members.
we believe that one of the reasons our guests prefer to shop at target, our team members choose target as a place of employment and our vendors choose to do business with us is the reputation we have built over many years for serving our four primary constituencies: guests, team members, shareholders, and the communities in which we operate. to be successful in the future, we must continue to preserve, grow, and leverage the value of target's reputation. reputational value is based in large part on perceptions. while reputations may take decades to build, any negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse mainstream and social media publicity, governmental investigations, or litigation. those types of incidents could have an adverse impact on perceptions and lead to tangible adverse effects on our business, including consumer boycotts, lost sales, loss of new store and technology development opportunities, or team member retention and recruiting difficulties. for example, we experienced weaker than expected sales immediately following the announcement of a data breach that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2013. more recently, the sale of our pharmacy and clinic assets to cvs means that cvs will be operating clinics and pharmacies within our stores, and our guests' perceptions of and experiences with cvs, whether within our stores, at independent cvs locations, or otherwise may impact our reputation.
if we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
the retail business is highly competitive. in the past, we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our guests' shopping experience through a careful combination of price, merchandise assortment, store environment, convenience, guest service, loyalty programs and marketing efforts. our ability to create a personalized guest experience through the collection and use of accurate and relevant guest data is important to our ability to differentiate from other retailers. guest perceptions regarding the cleanliness and safety of our stores, the functionality and reliability of our digital channels, our in-stock levels, the effectiveness of our promotions, the attractiveness of our third party offerings, such as the clinics and pharmacies owned and operated by cvs, and other factors also affect our ability to compete. no single competitive factor is dominant, and actions by our competitors on any of these factors or the failure of our strategies to drive traffic across all sales channels could have an adverse effect on our sales, gross margins, and expenses.
we sell many products under our owned and exclusive brands. these brands are an important part of our business because they differentiate us from other retailers, generally carry higher margins than equivalent national brand products and represent a significant portion of our overall sales. if one or more of these brands experiences a loss of consumer acceptance or confidence, or if we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights in our owned and exclusive brands, our sales and gross margins could be adversely affected.
the continuing migration and evolution of retailing to online and mobile channels has increased our challenges in differentiating ourselves from other retailers. in particular, consumers are able to quickly and conveniently comparison shop and determine real-time product availability using digital tools, which can lead to decisions based solely on price, the functionality of the digital tools or a combination of those and other factors. we must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our guests regardless of the ultimate sales channel; providing and maintaining digital tools for our guests and team members that have the right features and are reliable and easy to use; working with our vendors to offer unique and distinctive merchandise, offering certain services our guests desire in our stores through third parties, such as cvs, offering a compelling guest loyalty program, and encouraging our guests to shop with confidence with our price-match policy. failures to effectively execute in these efforts, actions by our competitors in response to these efforts, or failures of our vendors to manage their own channels, content and technology systems could hurt our ability to differentiate ourselves from other retailers and, as a result, have an adverse effect on sales, gross margins, and expenses.

if we are unable to successfully develop and maintain a relevant and reliable experience for our guests, regardless of where our guest demand is ultimately fulfilled, our sales, results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected.
our business has evolved from an in-store experience to interaction with guests across multiple channels (in-store, online, mobile and social media, among others). our guests are using computers, tablets, mobile phones and other devices to shop in our stores and online and provide feedback and public commentary about all aspects of our business. we currently provide full and mobile versions of our website (target.com), offer applications for mobile phones and tablets, and interact with our guests through social media. retailing is rapidly evolving so that the majority of our sales in all of our channels are digitally enabled, and we must anticipate and meet changing guest expectations and counteract new developments and technology investments by our competitors. our evolving retailing efforts include implementing new technology, software and processes to be able to fulfill guest orders directly from our vendors and from any point within our system of stores and distribution centers. providing flexible fulfillment options is complex and may not meet guest expectations for accurate order fulfillment, faster and guaranteed delivery times, and low-price or free shipping. if we are unable to attract and retain team members or contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support these efforts, implement improvements to our guest‐facing technology in a timely manner, allow real-time and accurate visibility to product availability when guests are ready to purchase, quickly and efficiently fulfill our guests orders using the fulfillment and payment methods they demand, or provide a convenient and consistent experience for our guests across all sales channels, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected. in addition, if target.com and our other guest‐facing technology systems do not appeal to our guests, reliably function as designed, integrate across all sales channels, or maintain the privacy of guest data, or if we are unable consistently meet our guests' expectations, we may experience a loss of guest confidence and lost sales, which could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.
if we fail to anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences, our sales, gross margins and profitability could suffer.
a large part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trend‐right decisions and effectively manage our inventory in a broad range of merchandise categories, including apparel, accessories, home décor, electronics, toys, seasonal offerings, food and other merchandise. for example, our apparel and home décor assortment is continually evolving and in other areas of our product assortment, including food, we are supporting guest wellness goals and becoming more localized with items that appeal to local cultural and demographic tastes. failure to obtain accurate and relevant data on guest preferences, predict changing consumer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions, emphasize the correct categories, implement effective promotions, and personalize our offerings to our guests may result in lost sales, spoilage, and increased inventory markdowns, which would lead to a deterioration in our results of operations by hurting our sales, gross margins, and profitability.
technology investments and infrastructure risks if our capital investments in technology, supply chain, new stores and remodeling existing stores do not achieve appropriate returns, our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
our business is becoming increasingly reliant on technology investments, and the returns on these investments can be less predictable than building new stores and remodeling existing stores. we are currently making, and will continue to make, significant technology investments to support our efforts to provide a consistent guest experience across all sales channels, implement improvements to our guest‐facing technology, and evolve our supply chain and our inventory management systems, information processes, and computer systems to more efficiently run our business and remain competitive and relevant to our guests. these technology initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost. we must monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace, which depends on our ability to accurately forecast our needs and is influenced by the amount and pace of investments by our competitors. in addition, our growth also depends, in part, on our ability to build new stores and remodel existing stores in a manner that achieves appropriate returns on our capital investment. we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores. many of our expected new store sites are smaller and non-standard footprints located in fully developed markets, which require changes to our supply chain practices and are generally more time-consuming, expensive and uncertain undertakings than expansion into undeveloped suburban and ex-urban markets. targeting the wrong opportunities, failing to make the best investments, or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.
6
a significant disruption in our computer systems and our inability to adequately maintain and update those systems could adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain guest confidence.
we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage and account for inventory, process guest transactions, manage and maintain the privacy of guest data, communicate with our vendors and other third parties, service redcard accounts, summarize and analyze results, and on continued and unimpeded access to the internet to use our computer systems. our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses and malicious attacks, security breaches and catastrophic events. if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly or reliably, we may incur substantial repair or replacement costs, experience data loss or theft and impediments to our ability to manage inventories or process guest transactions, engage in additional promotional activities to retain our guests, and encounter lost guest confidence, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
we continually make significant technology investments that will help maintain and update our existing computer systems. implementing significant system changes increases the risk of computer system disruption. the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce our operational efficiency, and could negatively impact guest experience and guest confidence.
data security and privacy risks if our efforts to protect the security of information about our guests, team members and vendors are unsuccessful, we may face additional costly government enforcement actions and private litigation, and our sales and reputation could suffer.
an important component of our business involves the receipt and storage of information about our guests, team members, and vendors. we have programs in place to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents. however, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. in addition, hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery, or other forms of deceiving our team members, contractors, vendors, and temporary staff.
until the data breach in the fourth quarter of 2013, all incidents we experienced were insignificant. the data breach we experienced in 2013 was significant and went undetected for several weeks. both we and our vendors have experienced data security incidents subsequent to the 2013 data breach; however, to date these other incidents have not been material to our consolidated financial statements. based on the prominence and notoriety of the 2013 data breach, even minor additional data security incidents could draw greater scrutiny. if we or our vendors experience additional significant data security breaches or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breaches, we could be exposed to additional government enforcement actions and private litigation. in addition, our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their information, which could cause them to discontinue using our redcards or loyalty programs, or stop shopping with us altogether.
supply chain and third party risks interruptions in our supply chain or fulfillment network, increased commodity, supply chain and fulfillment costs, or changes in our relationships with our vendors could adversely affect our gross margins, expenses and results of operations.
we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise to our distribution centers, stores and our guests in a timely and efficient manner. as we continue to add fulfillment capabilities or pursue strategies with different fulfillment requirements, our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging. if our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments, whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons, we could experience merchandise out-of-stocks, delivery delays or increased delivery costs that could lead to lost sales and decreased guest confidence, and adversely affect our results of operations.
in addition, a large portion of our merchandise is sourced, directly or indirectly, from outside the united states, with china as our single largest source. political or financial instability, currency fluctuations, trade restrictions, the outbreak
7
of pandemics, labor unrest, transport capacity and costs, port security, weather conditions, natural disasters or other events that could slow or disrupt port activities and affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could disrupt our supply of merchandise and/or adversely affect our results of operations. there have been periodic labor disputes impacting the u.s. ports that have caused us to make alternative arrangements to continue the flow of inventory, and if these types of disputes recur or worsen, it may have a material impact on our costs or inventory supply. changes in the costs of procuring commodities used in our merchandise or the costs related to our supply chain, including vendor costs, labor, fuel, tariffs, currency exchange rates and supply chain transparency initiatives, could have an adverse effect on gross margins, expenses and results of operations. changes in our relationships with our vendors also have the potential to increase our expenses and adversely affect results of operations.
a disruption in relationships with third parties who provide us services in connection with certain aspects of our business could adversely affect our operations.
we rely on third parties to support a variety of business functions, including portions of our technology development and systems, our digital platforms and distribution network operations, credit and debit card transaction processing, extensions of credit for our 5% redcard rewards loyalty program, the clinics and pharmacies operated by cvs within our stores, the infrastructure supporting our guest contact centers, and aspects of our food offerings. if we are unable to contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support those strategies or integrate their products and services with our business, or if we fail to properly manage those third parties or if they fail to meet our performance standards and expectations, including with respect to data security, then our reputation, sales, and results of operations could be adversely affected. in addition, we could face increased costs associated with finding replacement providers or hiring new team members to provide these services in-house. if our guests do not react favorably to cvs's operations or if our relationship with cvs is ineffective, our ability to discontinue the relationship is limited and our results of operations may be adversely affected. in addition, if we wish to have clinics and pharmacies in any new stores, those clinics and pharmacies must be owned and operated by cvs.
legal, regulatory, global and other external risks our earnings are highly susceptible to the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the united states.
virtually all of our sales are in the united states, making our results highly dependent on u.s. consumer confidence and the health of the u.s. economy. in addition, a significant portion of our total sales is derived from stores located in five states: california, texas, florida, minnesota and illinois, resulting in further dependence on local economic conditions in these states. deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or consumer confidence could negatively affect our business in many ways, including slowing sales growth or reduction in overall sales, and reducing gross margins. these same considerations impact the success of our credit card program. even though we no longer own a consumer credit card receivables portfolio, we share in the economic performance of the credit card program with td. deterioration in macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect the volume of new credit accounts, the amount of credit card program balances and the ability of credit card holders to pay their balances. these conditions could result in us receiving lower profit‐sharing payments.
weather conditions where our stores are located may impact consumer shopping patterns, which alone or together with natural disasters, particularly in areas where our sales are concentrated, could adversely affect our results of operations.
uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect consumer shopping patterns, particularly in apparel and seasonal items, which could lead to lost sales or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our short-term results of operations. in addition, our three largest states by total sales are california, texas and florida, areas where natural disasters are more prevalent. natural disasters in those states or in other areas where our sales are concentrated could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores, distribution centers or key vendors, and cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers, stores, and directly to guests, which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs and lowering our sales.
8
we rely on a large, global and changing workforce of target team members, contractors and temporary staffing. if we do not effectively manage our workforce and the concentration of work in certain global locations, our labor costs and results of operations could be adversely affected.
with approximately 341,000 team members, our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense, and our business and regulatory compliance is dependent on our ability to attract, train, and retain the appropriate mix of qualified team members, contractors, and temporary staffing and effectively organize and manage those resources as our business and strategic priorities change. many team members are in entry-level or part-time positions with historically high turnover rates. our ability to meet our changing labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, collective bargaining efforts, health care and other benefit costs, changing demographics, and our reputation and relevance within the labor market. if we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers and an appropriate mix of qualified team members, contractors and temporary staffing, our operations, guest service levels and support functions could suffer. those factors, together with increasing wage and benefit costs, could adversely affect our results of operations. we are periodically subject to labor organizing efforts. if we become subject to one or more collective bargaining agreements in the future, it could adversely affect our labor costs and how we operate our business.
we maintain a headquarters location in india where there has generally been greater political, financial, environmental and health instability than the united states. an extended disruption of our operations in india could adversely affect certain operations supporting stability and maintenance of our digital sales channels and information technology development.
failure to address product safety concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.
if our merchandise offerings, including food, drug and children's products, do not meet applicable safety standards or our guests' expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk. all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards. events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns, including food or drug contamination, could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. in addition, negative guest perceptions regarding the safety of the products we sell could cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs, resulting in lost sales. in those circumstances, it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our guests.
our failure to comply with federal, state, local, and international laws, or changes in these laws could increase our costs, reduce our margins, and lower our sales.
our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations in the united states and other countries in which we operate. significant workforce-related legislative changes could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations. examples of possible workforce-related legislative changes include changes to an employer's obligation to recognize collective bargaining units, the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed, minimum wage requirements, advance scheduling notice requirements, and health care mandates. in addition, changes in the regulatory environment affecting privacy and information security, product safety, payment methods and related fees, responsible sourcing, supply chain transparency, or environmental protection, among others, could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices. in addition, if we fail to comply with other applicable laws and regulations, including wage and hour laws, the foreign corrupt practices act and local anti-bribery laws, we could be subject to legal risk, including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation, which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs, reducing our margins, and lowering our sales.
financial risks changes in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our net income.
a number of factors influence our effective income tax rate, including changes in tax law, tax treaties, interpretation of existing laws, and our ability to sustain our reporting positions on examination. changes in any of those factors could change our effective tax rate, which could adversely affect our net income. in addition, our operations outside of the united states may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate.
9
if we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit, our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations could suffer.
we are dependent on a stable, liquid, and well-functioning financial system to fund our operations and capital investments. in particular, we have historically relied on the public debt markets to fund portions of our capital investments and the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund seasonal needs for working capital. our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and maintaining strong credit ratings. if rating agencies lower our credit ratings, it could adversely impact our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances. each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically, and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same. in addition, we use a variety of derivative products to manage our exposure to market risk, principally interest rate and equity price fluctuations. disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could reduce our ability to meet our capital requirements or fund our working capital needs, and lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures, which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary fiscal 2015 included the following notable items:
•   gaap earnings per share were $5.31, including $0.07 related to discontinued operations.
•   adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $4.69.
•   comparable sales grew 2.1 percent. digital channel sales growth of more than 30 percent contributed 0.8 percentage points to 2015 comparable sales growth.
•   we sold our pharmacy and clinic businesses to cvs, recognizing a pretax gain of $620 million.
•   we paid dividends of $1,362 million in 2015, an increase of 13.0 percent above 2014.
•   we returned cash through share repurchase for the first time since second quarter 2013, with purchases of $3,441 million of common stock at an average price of $77.07 per share.
sales were $73,785 million for 2015, an increase of $1,167 million or 1.6 percent from the prior year. earnings from continuing operations before interest expense and income taxes in 2015 increased by $995 million or 22.0 percent from 2014 to $5,530 million. operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was $5,140 million, $5,131 million, and $7,519 million for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. proceeds from the sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses to cvs are included in investing cash flows provided by continuing operations. in 2013, operating cash flow provided by continuing operations includes $2.7 billion of proceeds from the sale of our u.s. credit card receivables.

adjusted diluted earnings per share               $4.69         $4.22         $4.29              11.3           %   (1.7   )%
note:  adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (adjusted eps), a non-gaap metric, excludes the impact of certain matters not related to our routine retail operations and the impact of our discontinued canadian operations. management believes that adjusted eps is meaningful to provide period-to-period comparisons of our operating results. a reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to gaap measures is provided on page 23.
we report after-tax return on invested capital (roic) from continuing operations as we believe roic provides a meaningful measure of the effectiveness of our capital allocation over time. for the trailing twelve months ended january 30, 2016, roic was 16.0 percent, compared with 12.4 percent for the trailing twelve months ended january 31, 2015. excluding the net gain on the sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses, roic was 13.9 percent for the trailing twelve months ended january 30, 2016. a reconciliation of roic is provided on page 24.
pharmacies and clinics transaction in december 2015, we closed the previously announced sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses to cvs for cash consideration of $1.9 billion. cvs now operates the pharmacy and clinic businesses in our stores under a perpetual operating agreement, subject to termination in limited circumstances. no profit-sharing arrangement exists, but cvs will make an annual, inflation-adjusted occupancy-related payment to us, starting at $20 million to $25 million in the first year of the agreement. we also entered into a development agreement with cvs through which we may jointly develop small-format stores.
in connection with the sale, we recognized a pretax gain of $620 million, which we recorded outside of segment results and excluded from adjusted eps. we also recorded deferred income of $694 million, which we will amortize into income evenly over the 23-year weighted average remaining accounting useful life of our stores.
during 2015, we used a portion of the $1.9 billion cash consideration to repurchase shares of our common stock and settle approximately $200 million of retained pharmacy and clinic net liabilities. we expect to use the remaining proceeds to pay approximately $500 million of related taxes and repurchase shares.
had this transaction closed prior to this year, our 2015 reported sales and cost of goods sold would have been lower by approximately $3.8 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, with no notable effect on ebitda or ebit.
this transaction is expected to be accretive to eps in every period following the closing, and should add 50 basis points or more to roic over time. in addition, due to the lower sales base without a significant effect on profits, we expect the transaction to have a favorable impact on our ebitda and ebit margin rates.
refer to note 6 of the financial statements for additional information about the transaction.

note: rate analysis metrics are computed by dividing the applicable amount by sales.
sales sales include merchandise sales, net of expected returns, and gift card breakage. refer to note 2 of the financial statements for a definition of gift card breakage. the increase in 2015 and 2014 sales reflects an increase in comparable sales of 2.1 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively, and the contribution from new stores, partially offset by a decrease in 2015 of approximately $550 million due to the sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses. inflation did not materially affect sales in any period presented.

comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing stores and digital channel sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. comparable sales include all sales, except sales from stores open less than 13 months, digital acquisitions operating less than one year, stores that have been closed, and digital acquisitions that we no longer operate. pharmacy and clinic sales for the comparable period following the sale to cvs are excluded from the calculation. comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry. as a result, our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

td offers credit to qualified guests through target-branded credit cards: the target credit card and the target mastercard credit card (target credit cards). additionally, we offer a branded proprietary target debit card. collectively, we refer to these products as redcards®. guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases and free shipping at target.com when they use a redcard. we monitor the percentage of sales that are paid for using redcards (redcard penetration) because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of incremental purchases on our redcards are also incremental sales for target.

gross margin rate our gross margin rate was 29.5 percent in 2015, 29.4 percent in 2014, and 29.8 percent in 2013. the 2015 increase was primarily due to favorable category sales mix and lower promotional activity relative to the highly promotional period in 2014 following the 2013 data breach, partially offset by the impact of increased digital channel sales.
the 2014 decrease was primarily due to promotional activity.
selling, general and administrative expense rate our sg&a expense rate was 19.6 percent in 2015, 20.0 percent in 2014, and 20.2 percent in 2013. the decrease in 2015 primarily resulted from cost saving initiatives and reduced marketing expense, partially offset by investments in other initiatives, none of which were individually significant. we will continue to seek efficiency savings to reinvest in our business; however, we do not expect the sg&a rate to continue to decline at the pace realized during 2014 and 2015.
the decrease in 2014 was primarily related to cost savings initiatives, partially offset by investments in technology and other initiatives, none of which were individually significant.

other performance factors other selling, general and administrative expenses we recorded $216 million, $174 million, and $81 million of selling, general and administrative expenses outside of the segment during 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. additional information about these items is provided within the reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to gaap measures on page 23 and note 30 of the financial statements.
net interest expense net interest expense from continuing operations was $607 million, $882 million, and $1,049 million for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. net interest expense for 2014 and 2013 included a loss on early retirement of debt of $285 million and $445 million, respectively.
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate from continuing operations decreased to 32.5 percent in 2015, from 33.0 percent in 2014, driven primarily by the $112 million tax benefit that resulted from releasing the valuation allowance on a capital loss related to our canada exit. this benefit is recorded in continuing operations as the release of the valuation allowance is attributable to a capital gain generated by the cvs transaction. the tax rate benefit from this valuation allowance release was partially offset by a year-over-year decrease in the favorable resolution of various income tax matters and the rate impact of higher pretax earnings. the resolution of various income tax matters reduced tax expense by $8 million and $35 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. note 23 of the financial statements provides a tax rate reconciliation.
our effective income tax rate from continuing operations decreased to 33.0 percent in 2014, from 34.6 percent in 2013, driven primarily by the net tax effect of our global sourcing operations and the favorable resolution of various income tax matters. the resolution of various income tax matters reduced tax expense by $35 million and $16 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.

discontinued operations on january 15, 2015, target canada co. and certain other wholly owned subsidiaries of target (collectively canada subsidiaries), comprising substantially all of our former canadian operations and our former canadian segment, filed for protection (the filing) under the companies' creditors arrangement act (ccaa) with the ontario superior court of justice in toronto (the court) and were deconsolidated. as a result, we recorded a pretax impairment loss on deconsolidation and other charges, collectively totaling $5.1 billion. the canada subsidiaries are executing a liquidation through the ccaa process.
income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $42 million during 2015.
in the fourth quarter of 2015, we reached settlements with two entities that controlled guaranteed leases representing approximately 46 percent of the recorded accrual at that time. under the settlement terms, these entities have subrogated to us their claims against the canada subsidiaries. the settlement amounts were materially consistent with our previously recorded accruals.
as part of a march 2016 settlement between the canada subsidiaries and all of their former landlords, we have agreed to subordinate a portion of our intercompany claims and make certain cash contributions to the estate in exchange for a full release from obligations under guarantees of certain leases. this agreement remains subject to creditor and court approval. the financial impact of this agreement is materially consistent with amounts recorded in our financial statements.

reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to gaap measures to provide additional transparency, we have disclosed non-gaap adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (adjusted eps). this metric excludes the impact of the 2015 sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses, the 2013 sale of our u.s. consumer credit card receivables portfolio, losses on early retirement of debt, net expenses related to the 2013 data breach, and other matters presented below. we believe this information is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our continuing operations. this measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles in the united states (gaap). the most comparable gaap measure is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. adjusted eps from continuing operations should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under gaap. other companies may calculate non-gaap adjusted eps from continuing operations differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies. prior year amounts have been revised to present adjusted eps on a continuing operations basis.

(c) calculated using the effective tax rate for continuing operations, which was 32.5 percent and 33.0 percent for the trailing twelve months ended january 30, 2016 and january 31, 2015.
(d) calculated as eight times our trailing twelve months rent expense.
(e) average based on the invested capital at the end of the current period and the invested capital at the end of the prior period.
(f) excluding the net gain on the sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses, roic was 13.9 percent for the trailing twelve months ended january 30, 2016.
capitalized operating lease obligations and operating lease interest are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, gaap. the most comparable gaap measure is total rent expense. capitalized operating lease obligations and operating lease interest should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under gaap.

analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources our period-end cash and cash equivalents balance increased to $4,046 million from $2,210 million in 2014, primarily reflecting the proceeds from the sale of the pharmacy and clinic businesses. due to the timing of the sale late in 2015, we did not fully deploy the net proceeds by the end of 2015. short-term investments of $3,008 million and $1,520 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2015 and 2014, respectively. our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments. this policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 60 days or less. we also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments.
cash flows our 2015 operations were funded by internally generated funds. operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was $5,140 million in 2015 compared with $5,131 million in 2014. proceeds from the sale of our pharmacy and clinic businesses to cvs are included in investing cash flows provided by continuing operations. these cash flows, combined with period year-end cash position, allowed us to invest in the business, pay dividends and repurchase shares under our share repurchase program.
inventory year-end inventory was $8,601 million, compared with $8,282 million in 2014. the increase was due to investments to drive growth in certain merchandise categories, improve in-stocks, and earlier receipts of certain merchandise.
share repurchases in june 2015, our board of directors authorized a $5 billion expansion of our existing share repurchase program to $10 billion. under this program, we have repurchased 94.6 million shares of common stock through january 30, 2016, at an average price of $69.57, for a total investment of $6.6 billion.
during 2015, we repurchased 44.7 million shares of our common stock, for a total investment of $3,441 million ($77.07 per share), including shares repurchased under accelerated share repurchase agreements. we did not repurchase any shares on the open market during 2014. however, as described in note 25 to the financial statements, we reacquired 0.8 million shares upon the noncash settlement of prepaid forward contracts related to nonqualified deferred compensation plans.
dividends we paid dividends totaling $1,362 million in 2015 and $1,205 million in 2014, an increase of 13.0 percent. we declared dividends totaling $1,378 million ($2.20 per share) in 2015, a per share increase of 10.6 percent over 2014. we declared dividends totaling $1,271 million ($1.99 per share) in 2014, a per share increase of 20.6 percent over 2013. we have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future.
short-term and long-term financing our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility, and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities. within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. our ability to access the long-term debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity. our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and maintaining strong credit ratings. as of january 30, 2016, our credit ratings were as follows:
credit ratings     moody's   standard and poor's   fitch long-term debt     a2        a                     a-
commercial paper   p-1       a-1                   f2
25
if our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above.
in 2015, we funded our peak holiday sales period working capital needs through internally generated funds. in 2014, we funded our peak holiday sales period working capital needs through internally generated funds and the issuance of commercial paper.

we have additional liquidity through a committed $2.25 billion revolving credit facility that expires in october 2018. no balances were outstanding at any time during 2015, 2014, or 2013 under this facility.
most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. in addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. we are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. additionally, at january 30, 2016, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a credit rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control and (ii) our long-term credit ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term credit ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade.
we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations, finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives, fund obligations incurred as a result of our exit from canada, pay dividends, and execute purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future. our exit from canada increased our after-tax cash flows beginning in 2015. we continue to anticipate ample access to commercial paper and long-term financing.

capital expenditures decreased in 2015 from the prior year as we opened fewer large-format stores and realized efficiency gains in technology, partially offset by increased guest experience and supply chain investments. capital expenditures were less than our initial expectations reflecting efficiency gains in technology combined with the impact of project timing shifts as we aligned investments against specific initiatives to drive growth, invest in our supply chain, and build out our omnichannel capabilities. capital expenditures decreased in 2014 from the prior year due to fewer remodels and new stores, partially offset by increased technology investments to support our omnichannel efforts and security enhancements.
we expect capital expenditures in 2016 to return to a level comparable with 2013 and 2014.

(c)   deferred compensation obligations include commitments related to our nonqualified deferred compensation plans. the timing of deferred compensation payouts is estimated based on payments currently made to former employees and retirees, forecasted investment returns, and the projected timing of future retirements.
(d)   real estate liabilities include costs incurred but not paid related to the construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities.
(e)   estimated tax contingencies of $215 million, including interest and penalties and primarily related to continuing operations, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. see note 23 of the financial statements for further information.
(f)   estimated loss contingencies, including those related to the canada exit and the 2013 data breach, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. see note 7 and note 19 of the financial statements for further information.
(g)   purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, equipment purchases, marketing-related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments, and service contracts. we issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. we do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. if we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. we also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditioned on terms of the letter of credit being met.
(h)   real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase, construction, or remodeling of real estate and facilities.
(i)   we have not included obligations under our pension plans in the contractual obligations table above because no additional amounts are required to be funded as of january 30, 2016. our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate.
off balance sheet arrangements:    other than the unrecorded contractual obligations noted above, we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements.
critical accounting estimates our analysis of operations and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap. preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. in the notes to consolidated financial statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. our estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could differ under other assumptions or conditions. however, except as discussed below regarding canada exit-related costs, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future
27
estimates or assumptions. our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit & finance committee of our board of directors. the following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment:
inventory and cost of sales:    we use the retail inventory method to account for the majority of our inventory and the related cost of sales. under this method, inventory is stated at cost using the last-in, first-out (lifo) method as determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to each merchandise grouping's ending retail value. the cost of our inventory includes the amount we pay to our suppliers to acquire inventory, freight costs incurred in connection with the delivery of product to our distribution centers and stores, and import costs, reduced by vendor income and cash discounts. the majority of our distribution center operating costs, including compensation and benefits, are expensed to cost of sales in the period incurred. since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market. we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts. historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic conditions change, including changing consumer demand, guest preferences, changing consumer credit markets, or increasing competition. we believe these risks are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months. inventory was $8,601 million and $8,282 million at january 30, 2016 and january 31, 2015, respectively, and is further described in note 12 of the financial statements.
vendor income receivable:    cost of sales and sg&a expenses are partially offset by various forms of consideration received from our vendors (vendor income). vendor income is earned for a variety of programs, such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions, advertising allowances, and compliance programs. we establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received. based on the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned. the majority of year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. historically, adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material. excluding pharmacy-related receivables, which were insignificant at period-end, vendor income receivable was $379 million and $426 million at january 30, 2016 and january 31, 2015, respectively. the vendor income receivable balance is described further in note 4 of the financial statements.
long-lived assets:    long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and/or disposition of the assets are less than their carrying amount. measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value, as appropriate. we recorded impairments of $54 million, $124 million, and $77 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, which are described further in note 14. as of january 30, 2016, a 10 percent decrease in the fair value of assets we intend to sell or close would result in additional impairment of $7 million in 2015. historically, we have not realized material losses upon sale of long-lived assets.
investments in and receivables from canada subsidiaries:    we determined the fair value and recoverability of our canadian investments by comparing the estimated fair value of the underlying assets of the canada subsidiaries to estimated liabilities. we estimated the fair value of the major asset classes using estimated selling price less cost to sell, the income approach based on estimated market rents and capitalization rates, and discounted cash flow analysis of the differential between estimated market rent and contractual rent payments, as appropriate. we also applied an estimated liquidation discount to reflect the ccaa filing.
outstanding liabilities include accounts payable and other liabilities, forward commitments, unsubordinated related party payables, lease liabilities, and other potential claims. potential claims include an accrual for the estimated probable loss related to claims that may be asserted against the canada subsidiaries under certain contracts. based on our estimates, the fair value of liabilities exceeds the fair value of assets.
to assess the fair value and recoverability of amounts receivable from the canada subsidiaries, we estimated the fair value of the underlying net assets of the canada subsidiaries available for distribution to their creditors in relation to the estimated creditor claims and the priority of those claims.
28
our estimates involve significant judgment and are based on currently available information, an assessment of the validity of certain claims, and estimated payments by the canada subsidiaries. our ultimate recovery is subject to the final liquidation value of the canada subsidiaries and may vary significantly from our current estimates. see note 7 of the financial statements for further information.
insurance/self-insurance:    we retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss, and team member medical and dental claims. however, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. we use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. general liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. our workers' compensation and general liability accrual was $498 million and $566 million at january 30, 2016 and january 31, 2015, respectively. we believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate; however, our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions. for example, a five percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our self-insurance expense by $25 million in 2015. historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. refer to item 7a, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures. we maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events, including network security matters.
income taxes:    we pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations, and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities. we periodically reassess these probabilities, and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, were $215 million and $195 million at january 30, 2016 and january 31, 2015, respectively, and primarily relate to continuing operations. we believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. income taxes are described further in note 23 of the financial statements.
pension accounting:    we maintain a funded qualified, defined benefit pension plan, as well as several smaller and unfunded nonqualified plans for certain current and retired team members. the costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs. eligibility and the level of benefits varies depending on team members' full-time or part-time status, date of hire, and/or length of service. the benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected long-term rate of return, the discount rate, and compensation growth rates. the assumptions, with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes, are used to determine the period-end benefit obligation and establish expense for the next year.
our 2015 expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.5 percent is determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance, and current market conditions. our compound annual rate of return on qualified plans' assets was 8.4 percent, 7.2 percent, 6.8 percent, and 8.5 percent for the 5-year, 10-year, 15-year, and 20-year periods, respectively. a one percentage point decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase annual expense by $35 million. based on a change in our asset allocation policy in late 2015, our expected long-term rate of return is 6.8 percent for 2016.
the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds, using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. a 0.5 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $32 million.
based on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members.
pension benefits are further described in note 28 of the financial statements.
legal and other contingencies:    we are exposed to other claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest of our shareholders and other constituents. when a loss is probable, we record an accrual based on the reasonably estimable loss or range of loss. when no point of loss is more likely than another, we record the lowest amount in the estimated
29
range of loss and disclose the estimated range. we do not record liabilities for reasonably possible loss contingencies, but do disclose a range of reasonably possible losses if they are material and we are able to estimate such a range. if we cannot provide a range of reasonably possible losses, we explain the factors that prevent us from determining such a range. historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material.
we believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable. with the exception of canada exit-related loss exposures, we do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation may materially affect our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. however, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. if an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods. refer to note 7 of the financial statements for further information on the canada exit-related contingencies, respectively.

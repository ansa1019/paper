various factors exist that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-
looking statement. in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, we believe the following are some of the important risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations:
we operate in a highly competitive industry, and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our operations and profitability.
numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability. these factors include, but are not limited to, the following:
we compete with other transportation service providers of varying sizes, some of which may have more
•  equipment, a broader global network, a wider range of services, greater capital resources or other competitive advantages;
•  some of our competitors may reduce their prices to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase prices or maintain revenue;
6
•  we may be unable to continue to collect fuel surcharges or our fuel surcharge program may become ineffective in mitigating the impact of fluctuating costs for fuel and other petroleum-based products;
•  many customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting "core carriers" as approved transportation service providers and we may not be selected;
•  many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, and this process may depress prices or result in the loss of some business to competitors;
•  some shippers may choose to acquire their own trucking fleet or may choose to increase the volume of freight they transport if they have an existing trucking fleet;
•  some customers may choose to consolidate certain ltl shipments through a different mode of transportation, such as truckload, intermodal or rail;
•  a trend towards consolidation in the ground transportation industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size;
•  advances in technology require increased investments to remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing to accept higher prices to cover the cost of these investments; and
•  competition from non-asset-based logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect our customer relationships and ability to maintain sufficient pricing.
if we are unable to effectively compete with other ltl carriers, whether on the basis of price, service or otherwise, we may be unable to retain existing customers or attract new customers, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, continued merger and acquisition activity in transportation and logistics could result in stronger or new competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated ltl industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.
if our employees were to unionize, our operating costs would increase and our ability to compete would be impaired.
none of our employees are currently represented under a collective bargaining agreement. however, from time to time there have been efforts to organize our employees at various service centers. further, congress or one or more states could approve legislation and/or the national labor relations board could render decisions or implement rule changes that could significantly affect our business and our relationship with our employees, including actions that could substantially liberalize the procedures for union organization. in addition, we can offer no assurance that the department of labor will not adopt new regulations or interpret existing regulations in a manner that would favor the agenda of unions, or that our employees will not unionize in the future, particularly if regulatory changes occur that facilitate unionization.
the unionization of our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations because:
•  restrictive work rules could hamper our efforts to improve and sustain operating efficiency;
•  restrictive work rules could impair our service reputation and limit our ability to provide next-day services;
•  a strike or work stoppage could negatively impact our profitability and could damage customer and employee relationships;
•  shippers may limit their use of unionized trucking companies because of the threat of strikes and other work stoppages; and
•  an election and bargaining process could divert management's time and attention from our overall objectives and impose significant expenses.

if we are unable to successfully execute our growth strategy, our business and future results of operations may suffer.
our growth strategy includes increasing the volume of freight moving through our existing service center network, selectively expanding our capacity and broadening the scope of our service offerings. in connection with our growth strategy, at various times, we have expanded and upgraded service centers, purchased additional equipment and increased our sales and marketing efforts, and we expect to continue to do so. our growth strategy exposes us to a number of risks, including the following:
•  shortages of suitable real estate may limit our growth and could cause congestion in our service center network, which could result in increased operating expenses;
•  growth may strain our management, capital resources, information systems and customer service;
•  hiring new employees may increase training costs and may result in temporary inefficiencies until those employees become proficient in their jobs; and
•  expanding our service offerings may require us to enter into new markets and encounter new competitive challenges.
we cannot assure that we will overcome the risks associated with our growth strategy. if we fail to overcome those risks, we may not realize additional revenue or profits from our efforts, we may incur additional expenses and, therefore, our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
we may be unable to successfully consummate and integrate acquisitions as part of our growth strategy.
although we have not completed an acquisition since 2008, growth through acquisitions has been a key component of our ltl growth strategy throughout our history. in the future, we may seek to acquire other ltl carriers as well as other complementary businesses. exploration of potential acquisitions requires significant attention from our management team. in addition, we expect to compete for acquisition opportunities with other companies, some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we do. we cannot ensure that we will have sufficient cash to consummate an acquisition or otherwise be able to obtain financing for any acquisition. if we are unable to access sufficient funding for potential acquisitions, we may not be able to complete transactions that we otherwise find advantageous.
any subsequent acquisition will entail numerous risks, including:
•  we may not achieve anticipated levels of revenue, efficiency, cash flows and profitability;
•  we may experience difficulties managing businesses that are outside our historical core competency and markets;
•  we may underestimate the resources required to support acquisitions, which could disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management;
•  we may incur unanticipated costs to our infrastructure to support new business lines or separate legal entities;
•  we may be required to temporarily match existing customer pricing in the acquiree's markets, which may be lower than the rates that we would typically charge for our services;
•  liabilities we assume could be greater than our original estimates or may not be disclosed to us at the time of acquisition;
•  we may incur additional indebtedness or we may issue additional equity to finance future acquisitions, which could be dilutive to our shareholders;
•  potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired company; and
•  an inability to recognize projected cost savings and economies of scale.
in addition, we may have difficulty integrating any acquired business and its operations, services and personnel into our existing operations, and such integration may require a significant amount of time and effort by our management team. to the extent we do not successfully avoid or overcome the risks or problems resulting from any acquisitions we undertake, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
8
our customers' and suppliers' businesses may be impacted by a downturn in the economy and/or a disruption of financial markets, which may decrease demand for our services.
adverse economic conditions can negatively affect our customers' business levels, the amount of transportation services they need, their ability to pay for our services and overall freight levels, any of which might impair our asset utilization. customers encountering adverse economic conditions may be unable to obtain additional financing, or financing under acceptable terms, due to disruptions in the capital and credit markets. these customers represent a greater potential for bad debt losses, which may require us to increase our reserve for bad debt.
economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more of our large customers could have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter. further, when adverse economic times arise customers may select competitors that offer lower rates in an attempt to lower their costs, and we might be forced to lower our rates or lose freight.
our suppliers' business levels also may be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions or financial constraints, which could lead to disruptions in the supply and availability of equipment, parts and services critical to our operations. a significant interruption in our normal supply chain could disrupt our operations, increase our costs and negatively impact our ability to serve our customers.
we also are subject to cost increases outside of our control that could materially reduce our profitability if we are unable to increase our rates sufficiently. such cost increases include, but are not limited to, increases in fuel prices, interest rates, taxes, tolls, license and registration fees, insurance, revenue equipment and healthcare for our employees.
difficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers could result in increases in driver compensation and could adversely affect our profitability, our ability to maintain or grow our fleet and our ability to maintain our customer relationships.
from time to time we have experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified drivers and such shortages may recur in the future. due in part to the time commitment, physical requirements, our stringent company hiring standards and current industry conditions, the available pool of qualified employee drivers has been declining. because of the intense competition for drivers, we may face difficulty maintaining or increasing our number of drivers. the compensation we offer our drivers is subject to market conditions that may require increases in driver compensation. if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified drivers, we could be required to adjust our compensation packages, amend our hiring standards, or operate with fewer trucks and face difficulty meeting customer demands, any of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability.
the fmcsa's csa initiative could adversely impact our ability to hire qualified drivers, meet our growth projections and maintain our customer relationships, each of which could adversely impact our results of operations.
the fmcsa's compliance, safety, accountability initiative ("csa") is an enforcement and compliance program designed to monitor and improve commercial motor vehicle safety by measuring the safety record of both the motor carrier and the driver. these measurements are scored and used by the fmcsa to identify potential safety risks and to direct enforcement action.
our csa scores are dependent upon our safety and compliance experience, which could change at any time. in addition, the safety standards prescribed in csa could change and our ability to maintain an acceptable score could be adversely impacted. public disclosure of certain csa scores was restricted through the enactment of the fixing america's surface transportation act of 2015 (the "fast act") on december 4, 2015; however, the fast act does not restrict public disclosure of all data collected by the fmcsa. if we receive unacceptable csa scores, and this data is made available to the public, our relationships with our customers could be damaged, which could result in a loss of business.
the requirements of csa could also shrink the industry's pool of drivers as those with unfavorable scores could leave the industry. as a result, the costs to attract, train and retain qualified drivers could increase. in addition, a shortage of qualified drivers could increase driver turnover, decrease asset utilization, limit growth and adversely impact our results of operations.

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability.
we are exposed to claims related to cargo loss and damage, property damage, personal injury, workers' compensation, group health and group dental. we have insurance coverage with third-party insurance carriers, but we assume a significant portion of the risk associated with these claims due to our sirs and deductibles. our operating results would be adversely affected if any of the following were to occur: (i) the number or the severity of claims increases; (ii) we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment; or (iii) claims exceed our excess coverage amounts. if claims exceed our sir or deductible levels, insurance companies exit the transportation insurance marketplace, or insurance market conditions change, insurers could raise premiums for excess coverage to cover their expenses and anticipated future losses. in addition, insurance companies generally require us to collateralize our sir or deductible levels. if these collateralization requirements increase, our borrowing capacity could be adversely affected.
healthcare legislation may increase our costs and reduce our future profitability.
to attract and retain employees, we maintain a competitive health insurance plan for our employees and their dependents. we cannot predict the impact that any state or federal healthcare legislation or regulation will have on our operations, but we expect costs associated with providing benefits under employee medical plans and healthcare-related costs associated with workers' compensation to continue to increase. rising healthcare costs in the united states could result in significant long-term costs to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. in addition, rising healthcare costs could force us to make further changes to our benefits program, which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees.
we have significant ongoing cash requirements that could limit our growth and affect our profitability if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital.
our business is highly capital intensive. we generally finance our capital expenditures and planned growth with existing cash, cash flow from operations, issuance of debt and through available borrowings under our existing senior unsecured credit agreement. we may require additional capital to finance long-term real estate purchase opportunities and acquisitions, which we may fund through additional debt or through equity offerings. if we are unable in the future to generate sufficient cash from our operations or raise capital by accessing the debt and equity markets, we may be forced to limit our growth and operate our equipment for longer periods of time, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
our business also has significant ongoing operating cash requirements. if our cash requirements are high or our cash flow from operations is low during particular periods, we may need to seek additional financing, which could be costly or difficult to obtain.
limited supply and increased costs of new equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow.
we may face difficulty in purchasing new equipment due to decreased supply and increased costs. investment in new equipment is a significant part of our annual capital expenditures and we require an available supply of tractors and trailers from equipment manufacturers to operate and grow our business. we may also be subject to shortages in raw materials that are required for the production of critical operating equipment and supplies, such as shortages in rubber or steel.
the price of our equipment may also be adversely affected in the future by regulations on newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines. we are subject to regulations issued by the u.s. environmental protection agency (the
"epa") and various state agencies that have required progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines. these regulations have resulted in higher prices for tractors and diesel engines and increased operating and maintenance costs, and there can be no assurance that continued increases in pricing or costs will not have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
10
we may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the availability and price of diesel fuel.
diesel fuel is a critical component of our operations and a significant operating expense for our business. despite the recent decline in diesel fuel prices, future increases in such prices and decreases in diesel fuel availability could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. diesel fuel prices and fuel availability can be impacted by factors beyond our control, such as natural or man-made disasters, adverse weather conditions, political events, disruption or failure of technology or information systems, price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels, terrorist activities, armed conflict and world supply and demand imbalances. we maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at many of our service center locations; however, we may be susceptible to fuel shortages at certain locations that could cause us to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis and to prevent a disruption to our service schedules. an interruption in the supply of diesel fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
we do not hedge against the risk of diesel fuel price increases. an increase in diesel fuel prices or diesel fuel taxes, or any change in federal or state regulations that results in such an increase, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. we have fuel surcharge programs in place with a majority of our customers, which help offset the negative impact of the increased cost of diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products.
however, we also incur fuel costs that cannot be recovered even with respect to customers with which we maintain fuel surcharge programs, such as those costs associated with empty miles or the time when our engines are idling.
because our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices, our fuel surcharge recovery may not capture the increased costs we pay for fuel, especially when prices are rising, leading to fluctuations in our levels of reimbursement. we regularly monitor the components of our pricing, including fuel surcharges, and address individual account profitability issues with our customers when necessary; however, there can be no assurance that fuel surcharges can be maintained indefinitely or will be sufficiently effective in offsetting increases in diesel fuel prices.
we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, and costs of compliance with, liabilities under, or violations of, existing or future environmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our business.
we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment, the presence of hazardous materials at our properties or in our vehicles, fuel storage tanks, the transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water. under certain environmental laws, we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites, as well as costs associated with the clean-up of accidents involving our vehicles. environmental laws have become and are expected to continue to be increasingly more stringent over time, and there can be no assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental laws or liabilities arising under such laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition.
in addition to the epa regulations on exhaust emissions with which we must comply, there is an increased regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions in the united states. we are also subject to increasing sensitivity to sustainability issues. this increased focus on sustainability may result in new regulations and/or customer requirements that could adversely impact our business. any future limitations on the emission of greenhouse gases, other environmental legislation or customer sustainability requirements could increase our future capital expenditures and have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
we are subject to the risks of litigation and governmental proceedings, which could adversely affect our business.
the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, property damage, cargo claims, safety and contract compliance, environmental liability and other matters. accordingly, we are, and in the future may be, subject to legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business, and may include class-action allegations. we are also subject to potential governmental proceedings and claims. the parties in such legal actions may seek amounts from us that may not be covered in whole or in part by insurance. defending ourselves against such legal actions could result in significant costs and could require a substantial amount of time and effort by our management team. we cannot predict the outcome of litigation or governmental proceedings to which we are a party or whether we will be subject to future legal actions. as a result, the potential costs associated with legal actions against us could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
11
we are subject to various risks arising from our international business operations and relationships, which could adversely affect our business.
we arrange for transportation and logistics services to and from various international locations and are subject to both the risks of conducting international business and the requirements of the foreign corrupt practices act of
1977 (the "fcpa"). failure to comply with the fcpa may result in legal claims against us. in addition, we face other risks associated with international operations and relationships, which may include restrictive trade policies, imposition of duties, taxes or government royalties imposed by foreign governments.
we operate in a highly regulated industry, and increased costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.
we are regulated by the dot and by various state agencies. these regulatory authorities have broad powers, generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations, as well as motor carrier registration, driver hours of service, safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers, transportation of hazardous materials, certain mergers and acquisitions and periodic financial reporting. the trucking industry is also subject to regulatory and legislative changes from a variety of other governmental authorities, which address matters such as: increasingly stringent environmental, occupational safety and health regulations, limits on vehicle weight and size, ergonomics, port security, and hours of service. in addition, we are subject to compliance with cargo-security and transportation regulations issued by the tsa and cbp within the u.s. department of homeland security. regulatory requirements, and changes in regulatory requirements, may affect our business or the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and increasing the costs of providing transportation services.
our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors, harsh weather conditions and disasters.
our operations are subject to seasonal trends common in our industry. our operating margins in the first and fourth quarters are typically lower than those during the second and third quarters due to reduced shipments during the winter months. harsh weather and disaster, whether natural or man-made, can also adversely affect our performance by reducing demand and reducing our ability to transport freight, which could result in decreased revenue and increased operating expenses.
if we are unable to retain our key employees, or if we do not effectively execute our succession plan, our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected.
our success will continue to depend upon the experience and leadership of our key employees and executive officers.
in that regard, the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity if we are unable to secure replacement personnel that have sufficient experience in our industry and in the management of our business. if we are unable to continue to develop and retain a core group of management personnel and execute succession planning strategies, or we encounter any unforeseen difficulties associated with the recent transition of members of our management team, our business could be negatively impacted in the future.
our principal shareholders control a large portion of our outstanding common stock.
earl e. congdon, david s. congdon, john r. congdon, jr. and members of their respective families beneficially own an aggregate of approximately 25% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. as long as the congdon family controls a large portion of our voting stock, they may be able to significantly influence the election of the entire board of directors and the outcome of all matters involving a shareholder vote. the congdon family's interests may differ from the interests of other shareholders and the status of their ownership could change at their discretion.
our financial results may be adversely impacted by potential future changes in accounting practices.
future changes in accounting standards or practices, and related legal and regulatory interpretations of those changes, may adversely impact public companies in general, the transportation industry or our operations specifically. new accounting standards or requirements could change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets and/or liabilities or could be costly to implement. these types of regulations could have a negative impact on our financial position, liquidity, results of operations and/or access to capital.
12
our information technology systems are subject to cyber and other risks, some of which are beyond our control, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.
we are reliant on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems for our operations as well as providing a value-added service to our customers. our information systems, including our accounting, communications and data processing systems, are integral to the efficient operation of our business. it is critical that the data processed by these systems remain confidential, as it often includes competitive customer information, confidential customer credit card and transaction data, employee records and key financial and operational results and statistics. cyber incidents that impact the security, availability, reliability, speed, accuracy or other proper functioning of these systems and measures, including outages, computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions, could have a significant impact on our operations. we utilize third-party service providers who have access to our systems and certain sensitive data, which exposes us to additional security risks. although our information systems are protected through physical and software safeguards as well as redundant systems, network security measures and backup systems, it is not practicable to protect against the possibility of power loss, telecommunications failures, cybersecurity attacks, and other cyber incidents in every potential circumstance that may arise. a significant cyber incident, including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware, or other damage, could interrupt or delay our operations, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers, expose us to a risk of loss or litigation, and/or cause us to incur significant time and expense to remedy such an event, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.
we rely heavily on information technology systems and any disruption to our technology infrastructure or failures of essential services upon which our information technology platforms rely could cause us to incur costs or result in a loss of business, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
our information technology systems are complex and require ongoing investments and enhancements to meet both internal requirements and the requirements of our customers. our information technology systems also depend upon the internet, third-party service providers, global communications providers, satellite-based communications systems, the electric utilities grid, electric utility providers and telecommunications providers. we have no control over the operation, quality, or maintenance of these services or whether vendors will improve their services or continue to provide services that are essential to our business. disruptions due to transitional challenges in upgrading or enhancing our technology systems or failures in the services upon which our information technology platforms rely, which may arise from adverse weather conditions or natural calamities, such as floods, hurricanes, earthquakes or tornadoes; illegal acts, including terrorist attacks; human error or systems modernization initiatives; and/or other disruptions, may adversely affect the services we provide, which could increase our costs or result in a loss of customers that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
damage to our reputation through unfavorable publicity could adversely affect our financial condition.
in the current environment of instantaneous communication and social media outlets, the quick and broad dissemination of information through media sources could cause damaging information about us, whether accurate or not, to be broadly publicized. unfavorable publicity about the company or our employees could damage our reputation and may result in a reduction in demand for our services or the loss of customers that could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. this unfavorable publicity could also require the need to allocate significant resources to the rebuilding of our reputation.
anti-terrorism measures may disrupt our business.
federal, state and municipal authorities have implemented and are continuing to implement various anti-terrorism measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. if additional security measures disrupt or impede the timing of our deliveries, we may fail to meet the requirements of our customers or incur increased expenses to do so. there can be no assurance that new anti-terrorism measures will not be implemented and that such measures will not have a material adverse effect on our operations.
13
a decrease in the demand and value of used equipment may impact our results of operations.
as we purchase new tractors and trailers as part of our normal replacement cycle each year, we rely on the used equipment market to dispose of our older equipment. oversupply in the transportation industry as well as adverse domestic and foreign economic conditions can negatively impact the demand for used equipment and, therefore, reduce the value we can obtain on our used equipment. if we are unable to sell our older equipment at or above our salvage value, the resulting losses could have a significant impact on our results of operations.
if we raise additional capital in the future, your ownership in us could be diluted.
any issuance of equity we may undertake in the future to raise additional capital could cause the price of our common stock to decline, or require us to issue shares at a price that is lower than that paid by holders of our common stock in the past, which would result in those newly issued shares being dilutive. if we obtain funds through a credit facility or through the issuance of debt or preferred securities, these obligations and securities would likely have rights senior to your rights as a common shareholder, which could impair the value of our common stock.
the market value of our common stock may fluctuate and could be substantially affected by various factors.
the price of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market constantly changes. we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. these factors include, among others:
•  actual or anticipated variations in earnings, financial or operating performance or liquidity;
•  changes in analysts' recommendations or projections;
•  failure to meet analysts' projections;
•  general economic and capital market conditions;
•  announcements of developments related to our business;
•  operating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers;
•  actions by government regulators; and
•  news reports of trends, concerns and other issues related to us or our industry, including changes in regulations.
our common stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future, and these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance. general market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices.
our articles of incorporation, our bylaws and virginia law contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in our control or our management.
provisions of our articles of incorporation, bylaws and the laws of virginia, the state in which we are incorporated, may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of us or a change in management that shareholders may consider favorable. these provisions:
•  limit who may call a special meeting of shareholders;
•  require shareholder action by written consent to be unanimous;
•  establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at shareholder meetings;
•  may make it difficult to merge with or otherwise absorb a virginia corporation acquired in a tender offer for the three years after the acquisition; and
•  may make an unsolicited attempt to gain control of us more difficult by restricting the right of specified shareholders to vote newly acquired large blocks of stock.
14
these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to take certain corporate actions. these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.

our 225 facilities are strategically dispersed over the states in which we operate. at december 31, 2015 , the terms of our leased properties ranged from month-to-month to a lease that expires in 2039. we believe that as current leases expire, we will be able to renew them or find comparable facilities without incurring any material negative impact on service to our customers or our operating results.
we also own eight non-operating service center properties. three of these properties are leased to third parties with lease terms that range from month-to-month to a lease that expires in 2036.
we believe that all of our properties are in good repair and are capable of providing the level of service required by current business levels and customer demands. in addition, we believe we have sufficient capacity in our service center network to accommodate increased demand for our services.

overview we are a leading, less-than-truckload ("ltl"), union-free motor carrier providing regional, inter-regional and national ltl services, which include ground and air expedited transportation and consumer household pickup and delivery, through a single integrated organization. in addition to our core ltl services, we offer a broad range of value-added services including container drayage, truckload brokerage, supply chain consulting and warehousing.
more than 95% of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers, whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the u.s. domestic economy.
in analyzing the components of our revenue, we monitor changes and trends in our ltl services using the following key metrics, which exclude certain transportation and logistics services where pricing is generally not determined by weight, commodity or distance:
ltl revenue per hundredweight - this measurement reflects the application of our pricing policies to the services we provide, which are influenced by competitive market conditions and our growth objectives.
generally, freight is rated by a class system, which is established by the national motor freight traffic association, inc. light, bulky freight typically has a higher class and is priced at higher revenue per
•  hundredweight than dense, heavy freight. fuel surcharges, accessorial charges, revenue adjustments and revenue for undelivered freight are included in this measurement. revenue for undelivered freight is deferred for financial statement purposes in accordance with our revenue recognition policy; however, we believe including it in our revenue per hundredweight metrics results in a better indicator of changes in our yields by matching total billed revenue with the corresponding weight of those shipments.
revenue per hundredweight is a commonly-used indicator of pricing trends, but this metric can be influenced by other factors, such as changes in fuel surcharges, weight per shipment, length of haul and the class, or mix, of our freight. as a result, changes in revenue per hundredweight do not necessarily indicate actual changes in underlying base rates.
ltl weight per shipment - fluctuations in weight per shipment can indicate changes in the mix of freight we receive from our customers, as well as changes in the number of units included in a shipment. generally, increases in weight per shipment indicate higher demand for our customers' products and overall increased
•  economic activity. changes in weight per shipment can also be influenced by shifts between ltl and other modes of transportation, such as truckload and intermodal, in response to capacity, service and pricing issues.  fluctuations in weight per shipment generally have an inverse effect on our revenue per hundredweight, as a decrease in weight per shipment will typically cause an increase in revenue per hundredweight.
average length of haul - we consider lengths of haul less than 500 miles to be regional traffic, lengths of haul between 500 miles and 1,000 miles to be inter-regional traffic, and lengths of haul in excess of 1,000
miles to be national traffic. this metric is used to analyze our tonnage and pricing trends for shipments
•  with similar characteristics, and also allows for comparison with other transportation providers serving specific markets. by analyzing this metric, we can determine the success and growth potential of our service products in these markets. changes in length of haul generally have a direct effect on our revenue per hundredweight, as an increase in length of haul will typically cause an increase in revenue per hundredweight.
our primary revenue focus is to increase "density," which is shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure. increases in density allow us to maximize our asset utilization and labor productivity, which we measure over many different functional areas of our operations including linehaul load factor, pickup and delivery
("p&d") stops per hour, p&d shipments per hour, platform pounds handled per hour and platform shipments per hour.
in addition to our focus on density and operating efficiencies, it is critical for us to obtain an appropriate yield on the shipments we handle. we manage our yields by focusing on individual account profitability. we believe yield management and improvements in efficiency are key components in our ability to produce profitable growth.
our primary cost elements are direct wages and benefits associated with the movement of freight, operating supplies and expenses, which include diesel fuel, and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities. we gauge our overall success in managing costs by monitoring our operating ratio, a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue, which also allows for industry-wide comparisons with our competitors.

we continually upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs. our technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our network, increases the productivity of our workforce and provides key metrics that we use to monitor and enhance our processes.

in 2015, we produced revenue growth of 6.6%, increased net income by 13.9% and increased diluted earnings per diluted share by 15.2%. these results were achieved during a period of general softening in the domestic economic environment. we believe our revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in tonnage attributable to winning additional market share, as our new and existing customers increasingly respond to the value of our premium service. our tonnage growth resulted from an increase in shipments, which was partially offset by the decline in weight per shipment. we believe our long-term strategy of providing industry-leading service continues to drive our market share growth, while also allowing us to remain committed to our disciplined yield management process.
our tonnage growth during 2015 led to increased density within our freight movement operations and service center network. the additional freight density and our focus on operational efficiency led to productivity improvements in both of our platform and p&d operations. these improvements, when combined with our disciplined yield management process, generated a 100 basis-point improvement in our operating ratio in 2015, which represents the sixth consecutive year that our operating ratio has improved at least 100 basis points. as a result, our net income and earnings per diluted share in 2015 were $304.7 million and $3.57, respectively.
revenue our revenue in 2015 increased $184.5 million, or 6.6% as compared to 2014. ltl tonnage increased 7.4% primarily due to the 11.6% increase in ltl shipments, although our tonnage growth was affected by a 3.8% decrease in weight per shipment. we attribute the decline in weight per shipment in 2015 to softening economic conditions and changes in the mix of our freight.
ltl revenue per hundredweight decreased 0.5% to $18.23 in 2015, primarily due to declines in our fuel surcharges.
ltl revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 5.7% in 2015 as compared to 2014, which includes the positive effect on this metric from a decrease in weight per shipment. we believe the increase in revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, reflects our continued commitment to a disciplined yield management process and a relatively stable pricing environment.
most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge that is generally indexed to the u.s. department of energy's ("doe") published diesel fuel prices that reset each week. our fuel surcharges are designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of petroleum-based products and are one of the many components included in the overall negotiated price we charge for our services. fuel surcharge revenue decreased to 10.4% of revenue in 2015 from
15.5% in 2014, primarily due to a decrease in the average price per gallon for diesel fuel for those comparative periods. we regularly monitor the components of our pricing, including base freight rates and fuel surcharges, and our costs at the customer level. we address individual customer profitability issues to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses.
21
operating costs and other expenses salaries, wages and benefits increased $188.5 million, or 13.6% in 2015 due to a $143.6 million increase in salaries and wages and a $44.9 million increase in benefit costs. the increase in salaries and wages, excluding benefits, was primarily due to an increase in the average number of full-time employees of 2,063, or 13.5%, over
2014, as well as annual wage increases provided to our employees in september of 2014 and 2015. the increase in full-time employees was necessary to provide capacity for the increase in shipments during the year. we also implemented certain operational initiatives that decreased our reliance on purchased transportation providers and increased our utilization of company employees and equipment. the additional freight density contributed to a slight improvement in our p&d and platform shipments per hour, which improved 1.1% and 1.8%, respectively from
2014. our aggregate productive labor costs increased to 27.9% of revenue in 2015 as compared to 25.8% in 2014, while our other salaries and wages increased to 11.9% of revenue in 2015 as compared to 11.5% in 2014.
employee benefit costs increased $44.9 million, or 13.2% primarily due to an increase in the number of full-time employees eligible for benefits, certain enhancements to paid-time-off benefits and an increase in our workers compensation expense. these increases were partially offset by a reduction in expense for certain retirement benefit plans directly linked to the share price of our common stock. in the fourth quarter of 2015 our group health costs increased and we anticipate this trend to continue into 2016. employee benefit costs in 2015 were
32.6% of salaries and wages as compared to 32.8% in 2014.
operating supplies and expenses decreased $78.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014. the cost of diesel fuel, excluding fuel taxes, represents the largest component of operating supplies and expenses, and can vary based on both average price per gallon and consumption. our diesel fuel costs decreased primarily due to a 33.7% decrease in our average cost per gallon during 2015 as compared to the prior year. this decrease was partially offset by an increase in fuel consumption of 9.1%, primarily due to an 11.6% increase in linehaul and p&d miles driven. our fuel consumption benefited from an overall improvement in miles per gallon, which continues to improve as we add newer, more fuel-efficient equipment to our operations. the additional fuel consumption resulted in an increase in fuel taxes, which increased our operating taxes and licenses. we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are therefore subject to market price fluctuations. other operating supplies and expenses, excluding diesel fuel, remained relatively consistent as a percent of revenue between the periods compared.
depreciation and amortization expenses increased $18.9 million primarily due to the assets acquired through our
2015 and 2014 capital expenditures. as a percent of revenue, our depreciation and amortization expense increased to
5.6% in 2015 compared to 5.3% in 2014. while our investments in real estate, equipment and technology can increase our costs, we believe these investments are necessary to support our continued growth and strategic initiatives.
purchased transportation expense decreased $13.0 million, or 10.1% in 2015 as compared to 2014. we primarily utilized purchased transportation services from third-party providers to support our container drayage, international freight-forwarding and truckload brokerage services. we also utilized purchased transportation to perform limited p&d services in our ltl operations. the decrease in purchased transportation was primarily due to operational improvement initiatives to reduce our use of third-party providers for the movement of our customers'
shipments.
our effective tax rate in 2015 was 37.8% as compared to 38.1% in 2014. our effective tax rates in 2015 and 2014
were favorably impacted by various tax credits, including credits for the use of alternative fuel in our operations. our effective tax rate generally exceeds the federal statutory rate of 35% due to the impact of state taxes, and to a lesser extent, certain other non-deductible items.

our 2014 financial results reflected strong increases in revenue, net income and earnings per diluted share. our revenue increased 19.3% to $2.79 billion and our operating ratio improved by 130 basis points to 84.2%, which represented the fifth consecutive year that our operating ratio has improved by more than 100 basis points. as a result, our net income increased 29.8% from the prior-year period to $267.5 million in 2014.
our revenue growth in 2014 was driven by a 16.9% increase in ltl tons combined with a 2.1% increase in revenue per hundredweight. our tonnage growth was primarily the result of market share gains from new and existing customers that desire the value of superior service at a fair price. this growth increased density throughout our operations, which contributed to our improved profitability for the year. our growth has required continuous and significant investments in our service center network, equipment, technology and employees. as a result, our capital expenditures were $367.7 million in 2014 and were even higher in 2015. in addition, we added 2,370 full-time employees in 2014, which included an increase in our total number of drivers of 1,253, or 16.8%. we believe these investments provided the additional capacity needed to meet demand, and positioned us well for anticipated future growth.
revenue our revenue increased $450.2 million, or 19.3% during 2014, which was a result of increases in both ltl tonnage and yield. ltl tonnage increased 16.9% primarily due to the 14.2% increase in ltl shipments and a 2.3% increase in weight per shipment. we believe that our tonnage growth in 2014 was primarily due to further market share gains from our existing customers, the addition of new customers and the general improvement in the domestic economy.
ltl revenue per hundredweight increased 2.1% to $18.33 in 2014, despite declines in fuel surcharge rates, the decrease in length of haul and the increase in weight per shipment, each of which generally has the effect of lowering this metric. ltl revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 2.8% in 2014 as compared to 2013. we believe the increase in revenue per hundredweight reflected our disciplined yield management process and a favorable pricing environment that resulted from general capacity constraints in the ltl industry.
our fuel surcharges are designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of petroleum-based products and are one of the many components included in the overall negotiated price we charge for our services. fuel surcharge revenue decreased to 15.5% of revenue in 2014 from 16.1% in 2013, primarily due to a decrease in the average price per gallon for diesel fuel for those comparative periods. most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge that is generally indexed to the doe's published diesel fuel prices that reset each week. fluctuations in fuel surcharges between the periods are primarily the result of changes in the underlying price of diesel fuel. we regularly monitor the components of our pricing, including base freight rates and fuel surcharges. we also address any individual account profitability issues with our customers as part of our effort to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses.
23
operating costs and other expenses salaries, wages and benefits increased $210.5 million, or 18.0% in 2014 due to a $170.4 million increase in salaries and wages and a $40.1 million increase in benefit costs. the increases in salaries and wages, excluding benefits, were primarily due to the 13.5% increase in the average number of full-time employees over 2013 and the annual wage increases in 2013 and 2014. the increase in employees primarily related to our productive labor workforce, which was necessary to keep pace with our increased volumes during the year. in addition to the increase in employees, our costs were also impacted by a productivity decline in our platform operations that increased these costs as a percent of revenue. our aggregate productive labor costs increased to 25.8% of revenue in 2014 as compared to 25.5% in 2013, while our other salaries and wages improved to 11.5% of revenue in 2014 as compared to
11.7% in 2013.
employee benefit costs increased $40.1 million primarily due to the increase in the number of full-time employees eligible for benefits, which led to higher payroll-related taxes and paid time off benefits. our employee benefit costs also increased for certain retirement benefit plans directly linked to the improvement in our net income and the share price of our common stock. the cost for our health and dental benefit plans increased over 2013, primarily due to an increase in the total number of eligible employees in the plans. this increase was partially offset by a reduction in the average cost per employee for these benefits in 2014 as compared to 2013. as a result, health and dental benefit expenses decreased as a percent of salaries and wages, which contributed to the overall improvement in total employee benefit costs as a percent of salaries and wages to 32.8% for 2014 from 34.6% for
2013.
operating supplies and expenses increased $47.5 million in 2014 as compared to 2013, although these costs as a percent of revenue improved to 15.5% of revenue in 2014 from 16.5% in 2013. the cost of diesel fuel, excluding fuel taxes, represents the largest component of operating supplies and expenses, and can vary based on both consumption and average price per gallon. our total miles driven in 2014 increased 16.4% as compared to 2013, which compared favorably to our diesel fuel consumption, which increased only 13.0% during the same period. our consumption trends continued to improve due to certain operational initiatives to increase our average miles per gallon and the increased use of new fuel-efficient equipment. our cost of diesel fuel, excluding fuel taxes, also benefited from a decrease in our average cost per gallon of 4.3% for 2014 from 2013. we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are therefore subject to market price fluctuations. other operating supplies and expenses, excluding diesel fuel, remained relatively consistent as a percent of revenue between the periods compared.
depreciation and amortization expense increased $19.4 million primarily due to the increase in depreciable assets acquired through our 2014 and 2013 capital expenditure plans. as a percent of revenue, our depreciation and amortization expense decreased to 5.3% in 2014 as compared to 5.4% in 2013.
purchased transportation expense increased $22.9 million, or 21.5%, in 2014 as compared to 2013. these costs, however, were relatively consistent as a percent of revenue between the periods compared. we primarily utilized purchased transportation services from third-party providers in 2014 to support our container drayage, truckload brokerage and international freight-forwarding services. to a lesser extent, we also utilized purchased transportation in our ltl operations to maximize the efficient movement of freight.
miscellaneous expenses, net, increased $15.6 million in 2014 due to changes in our gains and losses recognized on the sale of operating assets, increased consulting costs associated with our ongoing technology enhancement efforts and increased legal costs. net gains on the sales of operating assets in 2014 were $0.7 million as compared to net gains of $5.7 million in 2013.
our effective tax rate for 2014 was 38.1% as compared to 37.3% in 2013. our effective tax rates in 2014 and 2013
were favorably impacted by various tax credits, including credits for the use of alternative fuel in operations.
our effective tax rate generally exceeded the federal statutory rate of 35% due to the impact of state taxes, and to a lesser extent, certain other non-deductible items.

the change in our cash flows provided by operating activities in 2015 from 2014 was due primarily to fluctuations within our working capital accounts, which include changes in income taxes, customer receivables and certain accrued liabilities. in addition, an increase in our net income and higher depreciation and amortization expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014, as described above in " results of operations, " also resulted in increased cash flows provided by operating activities.
the change in our cash flows provided by operating activities in 2014 from 2013 was due primarily to the significant improvement in our net income and higher depreciation and amortization expenses in 2014 as compared to
2013, which is more fully described above in " results of operations. " other changes in our cash flows provided by operating activities are related to various fluctuations within our working capital accounts.
the changes in our cash flows used in investing activities were primarily due to increases in our capital expenditure plan each year. the changes in our capital expenditure plan are more fully described below in " capital expenditures."
the changes in our cash flows used in financing activities were primarily due to repurchases of our common stock, which is more fully described below in "stock repurchase program." in addition, scheduled principal payments under our long-term debt agreements and fluctuations in our senior unsecured revolving line of credit also impacted our cash flows used in financing activities in each of the years compared.
we have three primary sources of available liquidity: cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit agreement, which is described below. we believe we also have sufficient access to debt and equity markets to provide other sources of liquidity.

our capital expenditure requirements are generally based upon the projected increase in the number and size of our service center facilities to support our plan for long-term growth, our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and forecasted tonnage and shipment growth. expenditures for land and structures can be dependent upon the availability of land in the areas we are looking to expand. our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers were higher in each of 2015 and 2014 as compared to the previous year due to the volume of equipment scheduled for replacement in those years as well as the
25
equipment needs for anticipated growth. we expect to continue to maintain a high level of capital expenditures in order to support our long-term plan for market share growth.
we currently estimate capital expenditures will be approximately $440 million for the year ending december 31,
2016. approximately $180 million is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities, construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities, subject to the availability of suitable real estate and the timing of construction projects; approximately $220 million is allocated for the purchase of tractors and trailers; and approximately $40 million is allocated for investments in technology and other assets. we expect to fund these capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations, our existing cash and cash equivalents and the use of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. we believe our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our expected capital expenditures.
stock repurchase program on november 10, 2014, we announced that our board of directors had approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to an aggregate of $200.0 million of our outstanding common stock. we may repurchase shares from time-to-time in open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions. the program expires on november 6, 2016. shares of our common stock repurchased by us under the repurchase program are canceled at the time of repurchase and are authorized but unissued shares of our common stock. during the twelve months ended december 31, 2015, we repurchased 1,682,419 shares for $114.1 million. during the twelve months ended december 31,
2014, we repurchased 70,620 shares for $5.5 million. as of december 31, 2015, we had repurchased a total of
1,753,039 shares for $119.6 million, and $80.4 million remained authorized under the program.
financing agreements on december 15, 2015, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with wells fargo bank, national association ("wells fargo") serving as administrative agent for the lenders (the "2015 credit agreement"). the 2015
credit agreement provides for a five-year, $250.0 million senior unsecured revolving line of credit. we may also request an increase in the line of credit commitments up to an aggregate of $350.0 million , which may include term loan commitments, in minimum increments of $25.0 million . of the $250.0 million line of credit commitments, up to
$100.0 million may be used for letters of credit and $30.0 million may be used for borrowings under the wells fargo sweep plus loan program (the "sweep program"). we utilize the sweep program to manage our daily cash needs, as it automatically initiates borrowings to cover overnight cash requirements primarily for working capital needs.
the amounts outstanding and remaining borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities are presented below:

available borrowing capacity     $       169,964       $  136,808
at our option, borrowings under the 2015 credit agreement bear interest at either: (i) libor plus an applicable margin (based on our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization) that ranges from 1.0% to 1.50% ; or (ii) a base rate plus an applicable margin (based on our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization) that ranges from 0.0% to 0.5% .
loans under the sweep program bear interest at the libor plus applicable margin rate. letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin for libor and base rate loans are charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during the quarter. commitment fees ranging from
0.125% to 0.2% (based upon the ratio of debt-to-total capitalization) are charged quarterly in arrears on the aggregate unutilized portion of the 2015 credit agreement. wells fargo, as administrative agent, also receives an annual fee for providing administrative services.
for the periods covered under the 2015 credit agreement, the applicable margin and letter of credit fees were 1.0%
and commitment fees were 0.125% .
the 2015 credit agreement superseded and replaced our previous five-year, $200.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility dated august 10, 2011, as amended on november 7, 2014 (the "2011 credit agreement"). for periods in
2015 and 2014 under the 2011 credit agreement, the applicable margin and letter of credit fees were 1.0% , and commitment fees were 0.175% .

the 2015 credit agreement contains customary covenants, including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of debt to total capital and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. any future wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries of old dominion would be required to guarantee payment of all of our obligations under the
2015 credit agreement.
the 2015 credit agreement also includes a provision limiting our ability to make restricted payments, including dividends and payments for share repurchases, unless, among other conditions, no defaults or events of default under the 2015 credit agreement are ongoing (or would be caused by such restricted payment). we did not declare or pay a cash dividend on our common stock in 2015 or 2014, and we have no plans to declare or pay a cash dividend in
2016. our share repurchases are described above in " stock repurchase program ."
we had two outstanding unsecured senior note agreements with an aggregate amount outstanding of $120.0 million at december 31, 2015 . at december 31, 2014 , we had three outstanding unsecured senior note agreements with an aggregate amount outstanding of $155.7 million . these notes include scheduled principal payments with maturities that range from 2016 to 2021, of which $25.0 million is due in the next twelve months. interest rates on these notes are fixed and range from 4.00% to 5.85%. the effective average interest rate on our outstanding senior note agreements was 4.68% and 4.87% at december 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
with the exception of borrowings pursuant to the 2015 credit agreement, interest rates are fixed on all of our debt instruments. therefore, short-term exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our revolving credit facility. we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes.
a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit our ability to generate cash flow and affect profitability. most of our debt agreements have covenants that require stated levels of financial performance, which if not achieved could cause acceleration of the payment schedules. as of december 31, 2015 , we were in compliance with these covenants. we do not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance that would cause us to violate any such covenants in the future, and we believe the combination of our
2015 credit agreement along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet foreseeable seasonal and long-term capital needs.

critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements, we apply the following critical accounting policies that we believe affect our judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. these critical accounting policies are further described in note 1 of the notes to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report.
27
revenue recognition we recognize revenue based upon when our transportation services have been completed in accordance with the bill of lading contract, our general tariff provisions or contractual agreements with our customers. generally, this occurs when we complete the delivery of a shipment. for transportation services not completed at the end of a reporting period, we use a percentage of completion method to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period. under this method, we develop a factor for each uncompleted shipment by dividing the actual number of days in transit at the end of a reporting period by that shipment's standard delivery time schedule. this factor is applied to the total revenue for that shipment and revenue is allocated between reporting periods accordingly.
allowances for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments. we estimate this allowance by analyzing the aging of our customer receivables, our historical loss experience and other trends and factors affecting the credit risk of our customers. we determine customer receivables to be past due when payment has not been received by the invoice due date. write-
offs occur when we determine an account to be uncollectible and could differ from our allowance estimate as a result of factors such as changes in the overall economic environment or risks surrounding our customers.
additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments. we periodically review the underlying assumptions in our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts to ensure that the allowance reflects the most recent trends and factors.
we also maintain an allowance for estimated revenue adjustments resulting from future billing corrections, customer allowances, money-back service guarantees and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments. these revenue adjustments are recorded in our revenue from operations. we use historical experience, trends and current information to update and evaluate these estimates.
claims and insurance accruals claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated cost of claims not covered by insurance for cargo loss and damage, bipd, workers' compensation, group health and dental. the related costs are charged to insurance and claims expense except for workers' compensation, group health and dental, which are charged to employee benefits expense.
insurers providing excess coverage above a company's self-insured retention ("sir") or deductible levels typically adjust their premiums to cover insured losses and for other market factors. as a result, we periodically evaluate our sir and deductible levels to determine the most cost-efficient balance between our exposure and excess coverage.
in establishing accruals for claims and expenses, we evaluate and monitor each claim individually, and we use factors such as historical claims development experience, known trends and third-party estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability. we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable; however, any changes in the severity of previously-reported claims, significant changes in medical costs and regulatory changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods.
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives. we use historical experience, certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset. when indicators of impairment exist, we review property and equipment for impairment due to changes in operational and market conditions, and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate.
estimated economic lives for structures are 7 to 30 years; revenue equipment is 4 to 15 years; other equipment is 2
to 20 years; and leasehold improvements are the lesser of the economic life of the leasehold improvement or the remaining life of the lease. the use of different assumptions, estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value and related depreciation of our assets.
28
inflation most of our expenses are affected by inflation, which typically results in increased operating costs. in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products, particularly diesel fuel, we generally include a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements. the fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of diesel fuel above a base price and fluctuates as diesel fuel prices change from the base, which is generally indexed to the doe's published fuel prices that reset each week. volatility in the price of diesel fuel, independent of inflation, has impacted our business, as described in this report. however, we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations for each of the past three years.
related party transactions family relationships each of earl e. congdon, david s. congdon and john r. congdon, jr. are related to one another and served in various management positions and/or on our board of directors during 2015. our employment agreements with earl e. congdon and david s. congdon are incorporated by reference as exhibits to this report. we regularly disclose the amount of compensation that we pay to these individuals, as well as any of their family members employed by us and whose compensation from time to time may require disclosure, in the proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders.
transactions with old dominion truck leasing, inc.
old dominion truck leasing, inc. ("leasing") is a north carolina corporation whose voting stock is beneficially owned by members of the congdon family. leasing is primarily engaged in the business of leasing tractors, trailers and other vehicles as well as providing contract dedicated fleet services. john r. congdon, jr. serves as chairman of the board of directors of leasing. earl e. congdon and david s. congdon currently serve as members of leasing's board of directors. we have historically collaborated with leasing for the purchase of certain equipment and fuel.
our collaboration with leasing for the purchase of fuel ended in the fourth quarter of 2015. we do not believe that the termination of this arrangement, or any other arrangement with leasing, will have a material adverse impact on our financial results.

market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates.
we are exposed to interest rate risk directly related to loans, if any, under our 2015 credit agreement, which have variable interest rates. a 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate on this agreement would have no material effect on our operating results. we have established policies and procedures to manage exposure to market risks and use major institutions that we believe are creditworthy to minimize credit risk.
we are exposed to market risk for equity investments relating to company-owned life insurance contracts on certain employees. at december 31, 2015 , the cash value for variable life insurance contracts was $35.6 million of the
$37.8 million of aggregate cash values for all life insurance contracts included on our balance sheets. variable life insurance contracts expose us to fluctuations in equity markets; however, we utilize a third-party to manage these assets and minimize that exposure. a 10% change in market value in those investments would have a $3.6
million impact on our pre-tax income.
we are exposed to market risk for awards granted under our employee and director phantom stock plans. the liability for the unsettled outstanding awards is remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on the closing price of our common stock at that date. at december 31, 2015 , the total liability for unsettled awards granted under our employee and director
29
phantom stock plans totaled $25.3 million . a 10% change in the price of our common stock at december 31, 2015
would have had a $2.5 million impact on our operating income in 2015 with respect to these plans.
we are also exposed to commodity price risk related to diesel fuel prices and manage our exposure to that risk primarily through the application of fuel surcharges to our customers.
for further discussion related to these risks, see notes 2 and 7 of the notes to the financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" and item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."

notes to the financial statements note 1. significant accounting policies business we are a leading, less-than-truckload ("ltl"), union-free motor carrier providing regional, inter-regional and national ltl services, which include ground and air expedited transportation and consumer household pickup and delivery, through a single integrated organization. more than 97% of our revenue is derived from these services. in addition to our core ltl services, we offer a broad range of value-added services including container drayage, truckload brokerage, supply chain consulting and warehousing.
we have one operating segment, and no single customer exceeds 10% of our revenue.
basis of presentation the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. actual results could differ from those estimates.
certain amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform prior years' financial statements to the current presentation.
unless the context requires otherwise, references in these notes to "old dominion," the "company," "we," "us" and
"our" refer to old dominion freight line, inc.
revenue and expense recognition we recognize revenue based upon when our transportation services have been completed in accordance with the bill of lading contract, our general tariff provisions or contractual agreements with our customers. generally, this occurs when we complete the delivery of a shipment. for transportation services not completed at the end of a reporting period, we use a percentage of completion method to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period. under this method, we develop a factor for each uncompleted shipment by dividing the actual number of days in transit at the end of a reporting period by that shipment's standard delivery time schedule. this factor is applied to the total revenue for that shipment and revenue is allocated between reporting periods accordingly.
expenses are recognized when incurred.
allowances for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. we estimate this allowance by analyzing the aging of our customer receivables, our historical loss experience and other trends and factors affecting the credit risk of our customers. write-offs occur when we determine an account to be uncollectible and could differ from our allowance estimate as a result of factors such as changes in the overall economic environment or risks surrounding our customers. additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments. we periodically review the underlying assumptions in our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts to ensure that the allowance reflects the most recent trends and factors.
we also maintain an allowance for estimated revenue adjustments resulting from future billing corrections, customer allowances, money-back service guarantees and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments. these revenue adjustments are recorded in our revenue from operations. we use historical experience, trends and current information to update and evaluate these estimates.
35

notes to the financial statements (continued)
credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of customer receivables. we perform initial and ongoing credit evaluations of our customers to minimize credit risk. we generally do not require collateral but may require prepayment of our services under certain circumstances. credit risk is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographic regions.
cash and cash equivalents we consider cash on hand and deposits in banks along with certificates of deposit and short-term marketable securities with original maturities of three months or less as cash and cash equivalents.
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost. major additions and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are charged to expense as incurred. we capitalize the cost of tires mounted on purchased revenue equipment as a part of the total equipment cost.
subsequent replacement tires are expensed at the time those tires are placed in service. we assess the realizable value of our long-lived assets and evaluate such assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
depreciation of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. the following table provides the estimated useful lives by asset type:
structures                7 to 30 years revenue equipment         4 to 15 years other equipment           2 to 20 years leasehold improvements    lesser of economic life or life of lease depreciation expense, which includes the amortization of capital leases, was $164.8 million , $145.8 million and
$126.4 million for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
goodwill intangible assets have been acquired in connection with business combinations and are comprised of goodwill.
goodwill is calculated as the excess cost over the fair value of assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. we review goodwill annually for impairment as a single reporting unit, unless circumstances dictate more frequent assessments, in accordance with accounting standards update ("asu") 2011-08, testing goodwill for impairment. asu 2011-08 permits an initial assessment, commonly referred to as "step zero", of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and also provides a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test required by accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 350.
we performed the qualitative assessment of goodwill on our annual measurement date of october 1, 2015 and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit would be greater than its carrying amount. therefore, we determined it was not necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test.
furthermore, there has been no historical impairment of our goodwill.
claims and insurance accruals as of december 31, 2015 , we maintained a self-insured retention ("sir") of $2.75 million per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage ("bipd") claims; a deductible of $100,000 per claim for cargo loss and damage; and a deductible of $1.0 million per occurrence for workers' compensation claims. we also had an sir of $500,000 per occurrence (with a $400,000 aggregate over our retention level) for group health claims.
36
old dominion freight line, inc.
notes to the financial statements (continued)
claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated cost of claims for cargo loss and damage, bipd, workers'
compensation, group health and group dental not covered by insurance. these accruals include amounts for future claims development and claims incurred but not reported, which are primarily based on historical claims development experience. the related costs for cargo loss and damage and bipd are charged to "insurance and claims" on our statements of operations, while the related costs for workers' compensation, group health and group dental are charged to "salaries, wages and benefits" on our statements of operations.
our liability for claims and insurance totaled $119.2 million and $107.7 million at december 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. the long-term portions of those reserves were $74.3 million and $65.4 million for 2015 and 2014 , respectively, which were included in "other non-current liabilities" on our balance sheets.
share-based compensation awards of phantom stock to employees and directors are accounted for as a liability under asc topic 718, compensation - stock compensation . asc topic 718 requires changes in the fair value of our liability to be recognized as compensation cost over the requisite service period for the percentage of requisite service rendered each period. changes in the fair value of the liability that occur after the requisite service period are recognized as compensation cost during the period in which the changes occur. we remeasure the liability for the outstanding awards at the end of each reporting period based on the closing price of our common stock at that date, and the compensation cost is based on the change in fair value for each reporting period.
advertising the costs of advertising our services are expensed as incurred and are included in "general supplies and expenses"
on our statements of operations. advertising costs charged to expense totaled $22.9 million , $19.3 million and
$16.7 million for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
fair values of financial instruments the carrying values of financial instruments in current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. the carrying value of our total long-term debt, including current maturities, and capital lease obligations was $133.8 million and $155.7 million at december 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. the estimated fair value of our total long-term debt and capital lease obligations was $139.1 million and $165.5 million at december 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. the fair value measurement of our senior notes was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis that factors in current market yields for comparable borrowing arrangements under our credit profile. since this methodology is based upon market yields for comparable arrangements, the measurement is categorized as level 2 under the three-level fair value hierarchy as established by the financial accounting standards board (the "fasb").
stock repurchase program on november 10, 2014, we announced that our board of directors had approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to an aggregate of $200.0 million of our outstanding common stock. we may repurchase shares from time-to-time in open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions. the program expires on november 6, 2016. shares of our common stock repurchased by us under the repurchase program are canceled at the time of repurchase and are authorized but unissued shares of our common stock. as of december 31, 2015 , we had repurchased 1,753,039 shares for $119.6 million , and $80.4 million remained authorized under the program.
comprehensive income the company has no components of other comprehensive income. accordingly, net income equals comprehensive income for all periods presented in this report.
earnings per share earnings per common share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. there were no potentially dilutive shares outstanding at the end of each period presented in this report.

"miscellaneous expenses, net" on our statements of operations.
recent accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, " revenue from contracts with customers " (topic 606). this asu supersedes the previous revenue recognition requirements in asc topic 605-revenue recognition and most industry-
specific guidance throughout the asc. the core principle within this asu is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received for those goods or services. in august 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-14, "revenue from contracts with customers", which deferred the effective date for asu 2014-09 by one year to fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2017, while providing the option to early adopt for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2016. transition methods under asu 2014-09 must be through either (i) retrospective application to each prior reporting periods presented, or (ii) retrospective application with a cumulative effect adjustment at the date of initial application. we continue to assess the method of application and impact, if any, of the adoption of asu 2014-09 on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
in april 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-05, " customer's accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement
" (topic 350). this asu provides additional guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. under asu 2015-05, if a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license, customers should account for the license element of the arrangement in a manner consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. if the arrangement does not contain a software license, customers should account for the arrangement as a service contract. the company will adopt the provisions of asu 2015-05 in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, and is currently evaluating the impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
in april 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-03, " interest - imputation of interest: simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs " (topic 835-30). this asu requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt's carrying value, which is consistent with the presentation of debt discounts. this asu is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2015. the company does not believe the adoption of asu 2015-03 will have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
in november 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-17, " balance sheet classification of deferred taxes " (topic 740). this asu requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet rather than being separated into current and noncurrent. the asu is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. we early adopted this asu on a retrospective basis during the fourth quarter of 2015. accordingly, deferred income tax assets in the amount of $29.4 million that were formerly classified as current assets at december 31, 2014, have been reclassified to non-current deferred income tax liabilities in our balance sheet.
in february 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-02, " leases " (topic 842). this asu requires a lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability under most operating leases in its balance sheet. the asu is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
early adoption is permitted. the company is currently evaluating the effects that the adoption of asu 2016-02 will have on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

we had two outstanding unsecured senior note agreements with an aggregate amount outstanding of $120.0 million at december 31, 2015 . at december 31, 2014 , we had three outstanding unsecured senior note agreements with an aggregate amount outstanding of $155.7 million . these notes include scheduled principal payments with maturities that range from 2016 to 2021, of which $25.0 million is due in the next twelve months. interest rates on these notes are fixed and range from 4.00% to 5.85% . the effective average interest rate on our outstanding senior note agreements was 4.68% and 4.87% at december 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
on december 15, 2015, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with wells fargo bank, national association ("wells fargo") serving as administrative agent for the lenders (the "2015 credit agreement"). the 2015
credit agreement provides for a five-year, $250.0 million senior unsecured revolving line of credit. we may also request an increase in the line of credit commitments up to an aggregate of $350.0 million , which may include term loan commitments, in minimum increments of $25.0 million . of the $250.0 million line of credit commitments, up to
$100.0 million may be used for letters of credit and $30.0 million may be used for borrowings under the wells fargo sweep plus loan program (the "sweep program"). we utilize the sweep program to manage our daily cash needs, as it automatically initiates borrowings to cover overnight cash requirements primarily for working capital needs.
at our option, borrowings under the 2015 credit agreement bear interest at either: (i) libor plus an applicable margin (based on our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization) that ranges from 1.0% to 1.50% ; or (ii) a base rate plus an applicable margin (based on our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization) that ranges from 0.0% to 0.5% .
loans under the sweep program bear interest at the libor plus applicable margin rate. letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin for libor and base rate loans are charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during the quarter. commitment fees ranging from
0.125% to 0.2% (based upon the ratio of debt-to-total capitalization) are charged quarterly in arrears on the aggregate unutilized portion of the 2015 credit agreement. wells fargo, as administrative agent, also receives an annual fee for providing administrative services.
for the periods covered under the 2015 credit agreement, the applicable margin and letter of credit fees were 1.0%
and commitment fees were 0.125% .
the 2015 credit agreement superseded and replaced our previous five-year, $200.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility dated august 10, 2011, as amended on november 7, 2014 (the "2011 credit agreement"). for periods in
2015 and 2014 under the 2011 credit agreement, the applicable margin and letter of credit fees were 1.0% , and commitment fees were 0.175% .
there were $67.7 million and $63.2 million of outstanding letters of credit at december 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
the 2015 credit agreement includes a provision limiting our ability to make restricted payments, including dividends and payments for share repurchases, unless, among other conditions, no defaults or events of default under the 2015 credit agreement are ongoing (or would be caused by such restricted payment). we did not declare or pay a cash dividend on our common stock in 2015 or 2014, and we have no plans to declare or pay a cash dividend in
2016. our share repurchases are described above in " stock repurchase program ."

old dominion truck leasing, inc. ("leasing") is a north carolina corporation whose voting stock is beneficially owned by members of the congdon family. leasing is primarily engaged in the business of leasing tractors, trailers and other vehicles as well as providing contract dedicated fleet services. john r. congdon, jr. serves as chairman of the board of directors of leasing. earl e. congdon and david s. congdon currently serve as members of leasing's board of directors. we have historically collaborated with leasing for the purchase of certain equipment and fuel.
our collaboration with leasing for the purchase of fuel ended in the fourth quarter of 2015. we do not believe these arrangements with leasing had a material impact on our financial results.
we purchased $313,000 , $298,000 and $299,000 of maintenance and other services from leasing in 2015 , 2014 and
2013 , respectively. we intend to continue to purchase maintenance and other services from leasing, provided that leasing's prices continue to be favorable to us. in addition, we received $12,000 , $17,500 and $18,000 from leasing for the rental of property in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
note 6. employee benefit plans defined contribution plan substantially all employees meeting certain service requirements are eligible to participate in our 401(k) employee retirement plan. employee contributions are limited to a percentage of the employee's compensation, as defined in the plan. we match a percentage of our employees' contributions up to certain maximum limits. in addition, we may also provide a discretionary matching contribution as specified in the plan. our employer contributions, net of forfeitures, for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were $30.3 million , $26.4 million and $20.6 million , respectively.
deferred compensation plan we maintain a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for the benefit of certain eligible employees, including those whose contributions to the 401(k) employee retirement plan are limited due to provisions of the internal revenue code. participating employees may elect to defer receipt of a percentage of their compensation, as defined in the plan, and the deferred amount is credited to each participant's deferred compensation account. the plan is not funded, and the company does not make a matching contribution to this plan. although the plan is not funded, participants are allowed to select investment options for which their deferrals and future earnings are deemed to be invested. participant accounts are adjusted daily to reflect participant deferrals and the performance of their deemed investments. the amounts owed to the participants totaled $48.7 million and $42.7 million at december 31,
2015 and 2014 , respectively, of which $44.5 million and $41.2 million were included in "other non-current liabilities" on our balance sheets as of december 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.

phantom stock plan expired in may 2012; however, grants under the 2005 phantom stock plan remain outstanding. each share of phantom stock awarded to eligible employees under the 2005 phantom stock plan represents a contractual right to receive an amount in cash equal to the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the settlement date, which generally is the earlier of the eligible employee's (i) termination from the company after reaching 55
years of age, (ii) death or (iii) total disability. no shares of common stock will be issued pursuant to the 2005
phantom stock plan, as the awards are settled in cash after the required vesting period has been satisfied and upon termination of employment.

a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. further, in designing a control system, we must take into account the benefits of controls relative to their costs. because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected.
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2015 has been audited by ernst & young llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

report of independent registered public accounting firm the board of directors and shareholders of old dominion freight line, inc.
we have audited old dominion freight line, inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31,
2015, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework) (the coso criteria). old dominion freight line, inc.'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
in our opinion, old dominion freight line, inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2015, based on the coso criteria
.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the balance sheets of old dominion freight line, inc. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2015 and our report dated february 29, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at item 15 (a)(2).

overview we are a leading, less-than-truckload ("ltl"), union-free motor carrier providing regional, inter-regional and national ltl services, which include ground and air expedited transportation and consumer household pickup and delivery, through a single integrated organization. in addition to our core ltl services, we offer a broad range of value-added services including container drayage, truckload brokerage, supply chain consulting and warehousing.
more than 95% of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers, whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the u.s. domestic economy.
in analyzing the components of our revenue, we monitor changes and trends in our ltl services using the following key metrics, which exclude certain transportation and logistics services where pricing is generally not determined by weight, commodity or distance:
ltl revenue per hundredweight - this measurement reflects the application of our pricing policies to the services we provide, which are influenced by competitive market conditions and our growth objectives.
generally, freight is rated by a class system, which is established by the national motor freight traffic association, inc. light, bulky freight typically has a higher class and is priced at higher revenue per
•  hundredweight than dense, heavy freight. fuel surcharges, accessorial charges, revenue adjustments and revenue for undelivered freight are included in this measurement. revenue for undelivered freight is deferred for financial statement purposes in accordance with our revenue recognition policy; however, we believe including it in our revenue per hundredweight metrics results in a better indicator of changes in our yields by matching total billed revenue with the corresponding weight of those shipments.
revenue per hundredweight is a commonly-used indicator of pricing trends, but this metric can be influenced by other factors, such as changes in fuel surcharges, weight per shipment, length of haul and the class, or mix, of our freight. as a result, changes in revenue per hundredweight do not necessarily indicate actual changes in underlying base rates.
ltl weight per shipment - fluctuations in weight per shipment can indicate changes in the mix of freight we receive from our customers, as well as changes in the number of units included in a shipment. generally, increases in weight per shipment indicate higher demand for our customers' products and overall increased
•  economic activity. changes in weight per shipment can also be influenced by shifts between ltl and other modes of transportation, such as truckload and intermodal, in response to capacity, service and pricing issues.  fluctuations in weight per shipment generally have an inverse effect on our revenue per hundredweight, as a decrease in weight per shipment will typically cause an increase in revenue per hundredweight.
average length of haul - we consider lengths of haul less than 500 miles to be regional traffic, lengths of haul between 500 miles and 1,000 miles to be inter-regional traffic, and lengths of haul in excess of 1,000
miles to be national traffic. this metric is used to analyze our tonnage and pricing trends for shipments
•  with similar characteristics, and also allows for comparison with other transportation providers serving specific markets. by analyzing this metric, we can determine the success and growth potential of our service products in these markets. changes in length of haul generally have a direct effect on our revenue per hundredweight, as an increase in length of haul will typically cause an increase in revenue per hundredweight.
our primary revenue focus is to increase "density," which is shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure. increases in density allow us to maximize our asset utilization and labor productivity, which we measure over many different functional areas of our operations including linehaul load factor, pickup and delivery
("p&d") stops per hour, p&d shipments per hour, platform pounds handled per hour and platform shipments per hour.
in addition to our focus on density and operating efficiencies, it is critical for us to obtain an appropriate yield on the shipments we handle. we manage our yields by focusing on individual account profitability. we believe yield management and improvements in efficiency are key components in our ability to produce profitable growth.
our primary cost elements are direct wages and benefits associated with the movement of freight, operating supplies and expenses, which include diesel fuel, and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities. we gauge our overall success in managing costs by monitoring our operating ratio, a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue, which also allows for industry-wide comparisons with our competitors.

we continually upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs. our technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our network, increases the productivity of our workforce and provides key metrics that we use to monitor and enhance our processes.

in 2015, we produced revenue growth of 6.6%, increased net income by 13.9% and increased diluted earnings per diluted share by 15.2%. these results were achieved during a period of general softening in the domestic economic environment. we believe our revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in tonnage attributable to winning additional market share, as our new and existing customers increasingly respond to the value of our premium service. our tonnage growth resulted from an increase in shipments, which was partially offset by the decline in weight per shipment. we believe our long-term strategy of providing industry-leading service continues to drive our market share growth, while also allowing us to remain committed to our disciplined yield management process.
our tonnage growth during 2015 led to increased density within our freight movement operations and service center network. the additional freight density and our focus on operational efficiency led to productivity improvements in both of our platform and p&d operations. these improvements, when combined with our disciplined yield management process, generated a 100 basis-point improvement in our operating ratio in 2015, which represents the sixth consecutive year that our operating ratio has improved at least 100 basis points. as a result, our net income and earnings per diluted share in 2015 were $304.7 million and $3.57, respectively.
revenue our revenue in 2015 increased $184.5 million, or 6.6% as compared to 2014. ltl tonnage increased 7.4% primarily due to the 11.6% increase in ltl shipments, although our tonnage growth was affected by a 3.8% decrease in weight per shipment. we attribute the decline in weight per shipment in 2015 to softening economic conditions and changes in the mix of our freight.
ltl revenue per hundredweight decreased 0.5% to $18.23 in 2015, primarily due to declines in our fuel surcharges.
ltl revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 5.7% in 2015 as compared to 2014, which includes the positive effect on this metric from a decrease in weight per shipment. we believe the increase in revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, reflects our continued commitment to a disciplined yield management process and a relatively stable pricing environment.
most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge that is generally indexed to the u.s. department of energy's ("doe") published diesel fuel prices that reset each week. our fuel surcharges are designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of petroleum-based products and are one of the many components included in the overall negotiated price we charge for our services. fuel surcharge revenue decreased to 10.4% of revenue in 2015 from
15.5% in 2014, primarily due to a decrease in the average price per gallon for diesel fuel for those comparative periods. we regularly monitor the components of our pricing, including base freight rates and fuel surcharges, and our costs at the customer level. we address individual customer profitability issues to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses.
21
operating costs and other expenses salaries, wages and benefits increased $188.5 million, or 13.6% in 2015 due to a $143.6 million increase in salaries and wages and a $44.9 million increase in benefit costs. the increase in salaries and wages, excluding benefits, was primarily due to an increase in the average number of full-time employees of 2,063, or 13.5%, over
2014, as well as annual wage increases provided to our employees in september of 2014 and 2015. the increase in full-time employees was necessary to provide capacity for the increase in shipments during the year. we also implemented certain operational initiatives that decreased our reliance on purchased transportation providers and increased our utilization of company employees and equipment. the additional freight density contributed to a slight improvement in our p&d and platform shipments per hour, which improved 1.1% and 1.8%, respectively from
2014. our aggregate productive labor costs increased to 27.9% of revenue in 2015 as compared to 25.8% in 2014, while our other salaries and wages increased to 11.9% of revenue in 2015 as compared to 11.5% in 2014.
employee benefit costs increased $44.9 million, or 13.2% primarily due to an increase in the number of full-time employees eligible for benefits, certain enhancements to paid-time-off benefits and an increase in our workers compensation expense. these increases were partially offset by a reduction in expense for certain retirement benefit plans directly linked to the share price of our common stock. in the fourth quarter of 2015 our group health costs increased and we anticipate this trend to continue into 2016. employee benefit costs in 2015 were
32.6% of salaries and wages as compared to 32.8% in 2014.
operating supplies and expenses decreased $78.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014. the cost of diesel fuel, excluding fuel taxes, represents the largest component of operating supplies and expenses, and can vary based on both average price per gallon and consumption. our diesel fuel costs decreased primarily due to a 33.7% decrease in our average cost per gallon during 2015 as compared to the prior year. this decrease was partially offset by an increase in fuel consumption of 9.1%, primarily due to an 11.6% increase in linehaul and p&d miles driven. our fuel consumption benefited from an overall improvement in miles per gallon, which continues to improve as we add newer, more fuel-efficient equipment to our operations. the additional fuel consumption resulted in an increase in fuel taxes, which increased our operating taxes and licenses. we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are therefore subject to market price fluctuations. other operating supplies and expenses, excluding diesel fuel, remained relatively consistent as a percent of revenue between the periods compared.
depreciation and amortization expenses increased $18.9 million primarily due to the assets acquired through our
2015 and 2014 capital expenditures. as a percent of revenue, our depreciation and amortization expense increased to
5.6% in 2015 compared to 5.3% in 2014. while our investments in real estate, equipment and technology can increase our costs, we believe these investments are necessary to support our continued growth and strategic initiatives.
purchased transportation expense decreased $13.0 million, or 10.1% in 2015 as compared to 2014. we primarily utilized purchased transportation services from third-party providers to support our container drayage, international freight-forwarding and truckload brokerage services. we also utilized purchased transportation to perform limited p&d services in our ltl operations. the decrease in purchased transportation was primarily due to operational improvement initiatives to reduce our use of third-party providers for the movement of our customers'
shipments.
our effective tax rate in 2015 was 37.8% as compared to 38.1% in 2014. our effective tax rates in 2015 and 2014
were favorably impacted by various tax credits, including credits for the use of alternative fuel in our operations. our effective tax rate generally exceeds the federal statutory rate of 35% due to the impact of state taxes, and to a lesser extent, certain other non-deductible items.

our 2014 financial results reflected strong increases in revenue, net income and earnings per diluted share. our revenue increased 19.3% to $2.79 billion and our operating ratio improved by 130 basis points to 84.2%, which represented the fifth consecutive year that our operating ratio has improved by more than 100 basis points. as a result, our net income increased 29.8% from the prior-year period to $267.5 million in 2014.
our revenue growth in 2014 was driven by a 16.9% increase in ltl tons combined with a 2.1% increase in revenue per hundredweight. our tonnage growth was primarily the result of market share gains from new and existing customers that desire the value of superior service at a fair price. this growth increased density throughout our operations, which contributed to our improved profitability for the year. our growth has required continuous and significant investments in our service center network, equipment, technology and employees. as a result, our capital expenditures were $367.7 million in 2014 and were even higher in 2015. in addition, we added 2,370 full-time employees in 2014, which included an increase in our total number of drivers of 1,253, or 16.8%. we believe these investments provided the additional capacity needed to meet demand, and positioned us well for anticipated future growth.
revenue our revenue increased $450.2 million, or 19.3% during 2014, which was a result of increases in both ltl tonnage and yield. ltl tonnage increased 16.9% primarily due to the 14.2% increase in ltl shipments and a 2.3% increase in weight per shipment. we believe that our tonnage growth in 2014 was primarily due to further market share gains from our existing customers, the addition of new customers and the general improvement in the domestic economy.
ltl revenue per hundredweight increased 2.1% to $18.33 in 2014, despite declines in fuel surcharge rates, the decrease in length of haul and the increase in weight per shipment, each of which generally has the effect of lowering this metric. ltl revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 2.8% in 2014 as compared to 2013. we believe the increase in revenue per hundredweight reflected our disciplined yield management process and a favorable pricing environment that resulted from general capacity constraints in the ltl industry.
our fuel surcharges are designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of petroleum-based products and are one of the many components included in the overall negotiated price we charge for our services. fuel surcharge revenue decreased to 15.5% of revenue in 2014 from 16.1% in 2013, primarily due to a decrease in the average price per gallon for diesel fuel for those comparative periods. most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge that is generally indexed to the doe's published diesel fuel prices that reset each week. fluctuations in fuel surcharges between the periods are primarily the result of changes in the underlying price of diesel fuel. we regularly monitor the components of our pricing, including base freight rates and fuel surcharges. we also address any individual account profitability issues with our customers as part of our effort to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses.
23
operating costs and other expenses salaries, wages and benefits increased $210.5 million, or 18.0% in 2014 due to a $170.4 million increase in salaries and wages and a $40.1 million increase in benefit costs. the increases in salaries and wages, excluding benefits, were primarily due to the 13.5% increase in the average number of full-time employees over 2013 and the annual wage increases in 2013 and 2014. the increase in employees primarily related to our productive labor workforce, which was necessary to keep pace with our increased volumes during the year. in addition to the increase in employees, our costs were also impacted by a productivity decline in our platform operations that increased these costs as a percent of revenue. our aggregate productive labor costs increased to 25.8% of revenue in 2014 as compared to 25.5% in 2013, while our other salaries and wages improved to 11.5% of revenue in 2014 as compared to
11.7% in 2013.
employee benefit costs increased $40.1 million primarily due to the increase in the number of full-time employees eligible for benefits, which led to higher payroll-related taxes and paid time off benefits. our employee benefit costs also increased for certain retirement benefit plans directly linked to the improvement in our net income and the share price of our common stock. the cost for our health and dental benefit plans increased over 2013, primarily due to an increase in the total number of eligible employees in the plans. this increase was partially offset by a reduction in the average cost per employee for these benefits in 2014 as compared to 2013. as a result, health and dental benefit expenses decreased as a percent of salaries and wages, which contributed to the overall improvement in total employee benefit costs as a percent of salaries and wages to 32.8% for 2014 from 34.6% for
2013.
operating supplies and expenses increased $47.5 million in 2014 as compared to 2013, although these costs as a percent of revenue improved to 15.5% of revenue in 2014 from 16.5% in 2013. the cost of diesel fuel, excluding fuel taxes, represents the largest component of operating supplies and expenses, and can vary based on both consumption and average price per gallon. our total miles driven in 2014 increased 16.4% as compared to 2013, which compared favorably to our diesel fuel consumption, which increased only 13.0% during the same period. our consumption trends continued to improve due to certain operational initiatives to increase our average miles per gallon and the increased use of new fuel-efficient equipment. our cost of diesel fuel, excluding fuel taxes, also benefited from a decrease in our average cost per gallon of 4.3% for 2014 from 2013. we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are therefore subject to market price fluctuations. other operating supplies and expenses, excluding diesel fuel, remained relatively consistent as a percent of revenue between the periods compared.
depreciation and amortization expense increased $19.4 million primarily due to the increase in depreciable assets acquired through our 2014 and 2013 capital expenditure plans. as a percent of revenue, our depreciation and amortization expense decreased to 5.3% in 2014 as compared to 5.4% in 2013.
purchased transportation expense increased $22.9 million, or 21.5%, in 2014 as compared to 2013. these costs, however, were relatively consistent as a percent of revenue between the periods compared. we primarily utilized purchased transportation services from third-party providers in 2014 to support our container drayage, truckload brokerage and international freight-forwarding services. to a lesser extent, we also utilized purchased transportation in our ltl operations to maximize the efficient movement of freight.
miscellaneous expenses, net, increased $15.6 million in 2014 due to changes in our gains and losses recognized on the sale of operating assets, increased consulting costs associated with our ongoing technology enhancement efforts and increased legal costs. net gains on the sales of operating assets in 2014 were $0.7 million as compared to net gains of $5.7 million in 2013.
our effective tax rate for 2014 was 38.1% as compared to 37.3% in 2013. our effective tax rates in 2014 and 2013
were favorably impacted by various tax credits, including credits for the use of alternative fuel in operations.
our effective tax rate generally exceeded the federal statutory rate of 35% due to the impact of state taxes, and to a lesser extent, certain other non-deductible items.

the change in our cash flows provided by operating activities in 2015 from 2014 was due primarily to fluctuations within our working capital accounts, which include changes in income taxes, customer receivables and certain accrued liabilities. in addition, an increase in our net income and higher depreciation and amortization expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014, as described above in " results of operations, " also resulted in increased cash flows provided by operating activities.
the change in our cash flows provided by operating activities in 2014 from 2013 was due primarily to the significant improvement in our net income and higher depreciation and amortization expenses in 2014 as compared to
2013, which is more fully described above in " results of operations. " other changes in our cash flows provided by operating activities are related to various fluctuations within our working capital accounts.
the changes in our cash flows used in investing activities were primarily due to increases in our capital expenditure plan each year. the changes in our capital expenditure plan are more fully described below in " capital expenditures."
the changes in our cash flows used in financing activities were primarily due to repurchases of our common stock, which is more fully described below in "stock repurchase program." in addition, scheduled principal payments under our long-term debt agreements and fluctuations in our senior unsecured revolving line of credit also impacted our cash flows used in financing activities in each of the years compared.
we have three primary sources of available liquidity: cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit agreement, which is described below. we believe we also have sufficient access to debt and equity markets to provide other sources of liquidity.

our capital expenditure requirements are generally based upon the projected increase in the number and size of our service center facilities to support our plan for long-term growth, our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and forecasted tonnage and shipment growth. expenditures for land and structures can be dependent upon the availability of land in the areas we are looking to expand. our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers were higher in each of 2015 and 2014 as compared to the previous year due to the volume of equipment scheduled for replacement in those years as well as the
25
equipment needs for anticipated growth. we expect to continue to maintain a high level of capital expenditures in order to support our long-term plan for market share growth.
we currently estimate capital expenditures will be approximately $440 million for the year ending december 31,
2016. approximately $180 million is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities, construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities, subject to the availability of suitable real estate and the timing of construction projects; approximately $220 million is allocated for the purchase of tractors and trailers; and approximately $40 million is allocated for investments in technology and other assets. we expect to fund these capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations, our existing cash and cash equivalents and the use of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. we believe our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our expected capital expenditures.
stock repurchase program on november 10, 2014, we announced that our board of directors had approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to an aggregate of $200.0 million of our outstanding common stock. we may repurchase shares from time-to-time in open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions. the program expires on november 6, 2016. shares of our common stock repurchased by us under the repurchase program are canceled at the time of repurchase and are authorized but unissued shares of our common stock. during the twelve months ended december 31, 2015, we repurchased 1,682,419 shares for $114.1 million. during the twelve months ended december 31,
2014, we repurchased 70,620 shares for $5.5 million. as of december 31, 2015, we had repurchased a total of
1,753,039 shares for $119.6 million, and $80.4 million remained authorized under the program.
financing agreements on december 15, 2015, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with wells fargo bank, national association ("wells fargo") serving as administrative agent for the lenders (the "2015 credit agreement"). the 2015
credit agreement provides for a five-year, $250.0 million senior unsecured revolving line of credit. we may also request an increase in the line of credit commitments up to an aggregate of $350.0 million , which may include term loan commitments, in minimum increments of $25.0 million . of the $250.0 million line of credit commitments, up to
$100.0 million may be used for letters of credit and $30.0 million may be used for borrowings under the wells fargo sweep plus loan program (the "sweep program"). we utilize the sweep program to manage our daily cash needs, as it automatically initiates borrowings to cover overnight cash requirements primarily for working capital needs.

at our option, borrowings under the 2015 credit agreement bear interest at either: (i) libor plus an applicable margin (based on our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization) that ranges from 1.0% to 1.50% ; or (ii) a base rate plus an applicable margin (based on our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization) that ranges from 0.0% to 0.5% .
loans under the sweep program bear interest at the libor plus applicable margin rate. letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin for libor and base rate loans are charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during the quarter. commitment fees ranging from
0.125% to 0.2% (based upon the ratio of debt-to-total capitalization) are charged quarterly in arrears on the aggregate unutilized portion of the 2015 credit agreement. wells fargo, as administrative agent, also receives an annual fee for providing administrative services.
for the periods covered under the 2015 credit agreement, the applicable margin and letter of credit fees were 1.0%
and commitment fees were 0.125% .
the 2015 credit agreement superseded and replaced our previous five-year, $200.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility dated august 10, 2011, as amended on november 7, 2014 (the "2011 credit agreement"). for periods in
2015 and 2014 under the 2011 credit agreement, the applicable margin and letter of credit fees were 1.0% , and commitment fees were 0.175% .

the 2015 credit agreement contains customary covenants, including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of debt to total capital and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. any future wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries of old dominion would be required to guarantee payment of all of our obligations under the
2015 credit agreement.
the 2015 credit agreement also includes a provision limiting our ability to make restricted payments, including dividends and payments for share repurchases, unless, among other conditions, no defaults or events of default under the 2015 credit agreement are ongoing (or would be caused by such restricted payment). we did not declare or pay a cash dividend on our common stock in 2015 or 2014, and we have no plans to declare or pay a cash dividend in
2016. our share repurchases are described above in " stock repurchase program ."
we had two outstanding unsecured senior note agreements with an aggregate amount outstanding of $120.0 million at december 31, 2015 . at december 31, 2014 , we had three outstanding unsecured senior note agreements with an aggregate amount outstanding of $155.7 million . these notes include scheduled principal payments with maturities that range from 2016 to 2021, of which $25.0 million is due in the next twelve months. interest rates on these notes are fixed and range from 4.00% to 5.85%. the effective average interest rate on our outstanding senior note agreements was 4.68% and 4.87% at december 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
with the exception of borrowings pursuant to the 2015 credit agreement, interest rates are fixed on all of our debt instruments. therefore, short-term exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our revolving credit facility. we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes.
a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit our ability to generate cash flow and affect profitability. most of our debt agreements have covenants that require stated levels of financial performance, which if not achieved could cause acceleration of the payment schedules. as of december 31, 2015 , we were in compliance with these covenants. we do not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance that would cause us to violate any such covenants in the future, and we believe the combination of our
2015 credit agreement along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet foreseeable seasonal and long-term capital needs.

critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements, we apply the following critical accounting policies that we believe affect our judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. these critical accounting policies are further described in note 1 of the notes to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report.

revenue recognition we recognize revenue based upon when our transportation services have been completed in accordance with the bill of lading contract, our general tariff provisions or contractual agreements with our customers. generally, this occurs when we complete the delivery of a shipment. for transportation services not completed at the end of a reporting period, we use a percentage of completion method to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period. under this method, we develop a factor for each uncompleted shipment by dividing the actual number of days in transit at the end of a reporting period by that shipment's standard delivery time schedule. this factor is applied to the total revenue for that shipment and revenue is allocated between reporting periods accordingly.
allowances for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments. we estimate this allowance by analyzing the aging of our customer receivables, our historical loss experience and other trends and factors affecting the credit risk of our customers. we determine customer receivables to be past due when payment has not been received by the invoice due date. write-
offs occur when we determine an account to be uncollectible and could differ from our allowance estimate as a result of factors such as changes in the overall economic environment or risks surrounding our customers.
additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments. we periodically review the underlying assumptions in our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts to ensure that the allowance reflects the most recent trends and factors.
we also maintain an allowance for estimated revenue adjustments resulting from future billing corrections, customer allowances, money-back service guarantees and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments. these revenue adjustments are recorded in our revenue from operations. we use historical experience, trends and current information to update and evaluate these estimates.
claims and insurance accruals claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated cost of claims not covered by insurance for cargo loss and damage, bipd, workers' compensation, group health and dental. the related costs are charged to insurance and claims expense except for workers' compensation, group health and dental, which are charged to employee benefits expense.
insurers providing excess coverage above a company's self-insured retention ("sir") or deductible levels typically adjust their premiums to cover insured losses and for other market factors. as a result, we periodically evaluate our sir and deductible levels to determine the most cost-efficient balance between our exposure and excess coverage.
in establishing accruals for claims and expenses, we evaluate and monitor each claim individually, and we use factors such as historical claims development experience, known trends and third-party estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability. we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable; however, any changes in the severity of previously-reported claims, significant changes in medical costs and regulatory changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods.
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives. we use historical experience, certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset. when indicators of impairment exist, we review property and equipment for impairment due to changes in operational and market conditions, and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate.
estimated economic lives for structures are 7 to 30 years; revenue equipment is 4 to 15 years; other equipment is 2
to 20 years; and leasehold improvements are the lesser of the economic life of the leasehold improvement or the remaining life of the lease. the use of different assumptions, estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value and related depreciation of our assets.
28
inflation most of our expenses are affected by inflation, which typically results in increased operating costs. in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products, particularly diesel fuel, we generally include a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements. the fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of diesel fuel above a base price and fluctuates as diesel fuel prices change from the base, which is generally indexed to the doe's published fuel prices that reset each week. volatility in the price of diesel fuel, independent of inflation, has impacted our business, as described in this report. however, we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations for each of the past three years.

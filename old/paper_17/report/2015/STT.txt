item 1a. risk factors forward-looking statements this form 10-k, as well as other reports submitted by us under the securities exchange act of 1934, registration statements filed by us under the securities act of 1933, our annual report to shareholders and other public statements we may make, contain statements (including statements in the management's discussion and analysis) that are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of u.s. securities laws, including statements about our goals and expectations regarding our business, financial and capital condition, results of operations, strategies, financial portfolio performance, dividend and stock purchase programs, expected outcomes of legal proceedings, market growth, acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures and new technologies, services and opportunities, as well as regarding industry, regulatory, economic and market trends, initiatives and developments, the business environment and other matters that do not relate strictly to historical facts.
terminology such as "plan," "expect," "intend," "objective," "forecast," "outlook," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "seek," "may," "will," "trend," "target," "strategy" and "goal," or similar statements or variations of such terms, are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such terms.
forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which change over time, are based on management's expectations and assumptions at the time the statements are made, and are not guarantees of future results. management's expectations and assumptions, and the continued validity of the forward-looking statements, are subject to change due to a broad range of factors affecting the national and global economies, regulatory environment and the equity, debt, currency and other financial markets, as well as factors specific to state street and its subsidiaries, including state street bank. factors that could cause changes in the expectations or assumptions on which forward-looking statements are based cannot be foreseen with certainty and include, but are not limited to:
•   the financial strength and continuing viability of the counterparties with which we or our clients do business and to which we have investment, credit or financial exposure, including, for example, the direct and indirect effects on counterparties of the sovereign-debt risks in the u.s., europe and other regions;
•   increases in the volatility of, or declines in the level of, our net interest revenue, changes in the composition or valuation of the assets recorded in our consolidated statement of condition (and our ability to measure the fair value of investment securities) and the possibility that we may change the manner in which we fund those assets;
•   the liquidity of the u.s. and international securities markets, particularly the markets for fixed-income securities and inter-bank credits, and the liquidity requirements of our clients;
•   the level and volatility of interest rates, the valuation of the u.s. dollar relative to other currencies in which we record revenue or accrue expenses and the performance and volatility of securities, credit, currency and other markets in the u.s. and internationally;
•   the credit quality, credit-agency ratings and fair values of the securities in our investment securities portfolio, a deterioration or downgrade of which could lead to other-than-temporary impairment of the respective securities and the recognition of an impairment loss in our consolidated statement of income;

17
restrictions on banking and financial activities. in addition, our regulatory posture and related expenses have been and will continue to be affected by changes in regulatory expectations for global systemically important financial institutions applicable to, among other things, risk management, liquidity and capital planning and compliance programs, and changes in governmental enforcement approaches to perceived failures to comply with regulatory or legal obligations;
•   adverse changes in the regulatory ratios that we are required or will be required to meet, whether arising under the dodd-frank act or the basel iii final rule, or due to changes in regulatory positions, practices or regulations in jurisdictions in which we engage in banking activities, including changes in internal or external data, formulae, models, assumptions or other advanced systems used in the calculation of our capital ratios that cause changes in those ratios as they are measured from period to period;
•   increasing requirements to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve or our other u.s. and non-u.s. regulators for the use, allocation or distribution of our capital or other specific capital actions or programs, including acquisitions, dividends and stock purchases, without which our growth plans, distributions to shareholders, share repurchase programs or other capital initiatives may be restricted;
•   changes in law or regulation, or the enforcement of law or regulation, that may adversely affect our business activities or those of our clients or our counterparties, and the products or services that we sell, including additional or increased taxes or assessments thereon, capital adequacy requirements, margin requirements and changes that expose us to risks related to the adequacy of our controls or compliance programs;
•   financial market disruptions or economic recession, whether in the u.s., europe, asia or other regions;
•   our ability to develop and execute state street beacon, our multi-year program to create cost efficiencies through changes to our operations and to further digitize our service delivery to our clients, any failure of which, in whole or in part, may among other things, reduce our competitive position, diminish the cost-effectiveness of our systems and processes or provide an insufficient return on our associated investment;
•   our ability to promote a strong culture of risk management, operating controls, compliance oversight and governance that meet our expectations and those of our clients and our regulators;
•   the results of our review of the manner in which we invoiced certain client expenses, including the amount of expenses determined to be reimbursable, as well as potential consequences of such review including with respect to our client relationships and potential investigations by regulators;
•   the results of, and costs associated with, governmental or regulatory inquiries and investigations, litigation and similar claims, disputes, or proceedings;
•   the potential for losses arising from our investments in sponsored investment funds;
•   the possibility that our clients will incur substantial losses in investment pools for which we act as agent, and the possibility of significant reductions in the liquidity or valuation of assets underlying those pools;
•   our ability to anticipate and manage the level and timing of redemptions and withdrawals from our collateral pools and other collective investment products;
•   the credit agency ratings of our debt and depository obligations and investor and client perceptions of our financial strength;

•   our ability to control operational risks, data security breach risks and outsourcing risks, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, the possibility of errors in the quantitative models we use to manage our business and the possibility that our controls will prove insufficient, fail or be circumvented;
•   our ability to expand our use of technology to enhance the efficiency, accuracy and reliability of our operations and our dependencies on information technology and our ability to control related risks, including cyber-crime and other threats to our information technology infrastructure and systems and their effective operation both independently and with external systems, and complexities and costs of protecting the security of our systems and data;
18
•   our ability to grow revenue, manage expenses, attract and retain highly skilled people and raise the capital necessary to achieve our business goals and comply with regulatory requirements and expectations;
•   changes or potential changes to the competitive environment, including changes due to regulatory and technological changes, the effects of industry consolidation and perceptions of state street as a suitable service provider or counterparty;
•   changes or potential changes in the amount of compensation we receive from clients for our services, and the mix of services provided by us that clients choose;
•   our ability to complete acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures, including the ability to obtain regulatory approvals, the ability to arrange financing as required and the ability to satisfy closing conditions;
•   the risks that our acquired businesses and joint ventures will not achieve their anticipated financial and operational benefits or will not be integrated successfully, or that the integration will take longer than anticipated, that expected synergies will not be achieved or unexpected negative synergies or liabilities will be experienced, that client and deposit retention goals will not be met, that other regulatory or operational challenges will be experienced, and that disruptions from the transaction will harm our relationships with our clients, our employees or regulators;
•   our ability to recognize emerging needs of our clients and to develop products that are responsive to such trends and profitable to us, the performance of and demand for the products and services we offer, and the potential for new products and services to impose additional costs on us and expose us to increased operational risk;
•   changes in accounting standards and practices; and
•   changes in tax legislation and in the interpretation of existing tax laws by u.s. and non-u.s. tax authorities that affect the amount of taxes due.
actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed in our forward-looking statements and from our historical financial results due to the factors discussed in this section and elsewhere in this form 10-k or disclosed in our other sec filings. forward-looking statements in this form 10-k should not be relied on as representing our expectations or beliefs as of any date subsequent to the time this form 10-k is filed with the sec. we undertake no obligation to revise our forward-looking statements after the time they are made. the factors discussed herein are not intended to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties that may affect our businesses. we cannot anticipate all developments that may adversely affect our business or operations or our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
forward-looking statements should not be viewed as predictions, and should not be the primary basis on which investors evaluate state street. any investor in state street should consider all risks and uncertainties disclosed in our sec filings, including our filings under the securities exchange act of 1934, in particular our annual reports on form 10-k, our quarterly reports on form 10-q and our current reports on form 8-k, or registration statements filed under the securities act of 1933, all of which are accessible on the sec's website at www.sec.gov or on the "investor relations" section of our corporate website at www.statestreet.com.

risk factors in the normal course of our business activities, we are exposed to a variety of risks. the following is a discussion of various risk factors applicable to state street. additional information about our risk management framework is included under "risk management" in management's discussion and analysis included under item 7 of this form 10-k. additional risks beyond those described in management's discussion and analysis or in the following discussion may be inherent in our activities or operations as currently conducted, or as we may conduct them in the future, or in the markets in which we operate or may in the future operate.
credit and counterparty, liquidity and market risks we assume significant credit risk to counterparties, many of which are major financial institutions. these financial institutions and other counterparties may also have substantial financial dependencies with other financial institutions and sovereign entities. this credit exposure and concentration could expose us to financial loss.
the financial markets are characterized by extensive interdependencies among numerous parties, including banks, central banks, broker/dealers, insurance companies and other financial institutions. these financial institutions also include collective investment funds, such as mutual funds, ucits and hedge funds that share these interdependencies. many financial institutions, including collective investment funds also hold, or are exposed to, loans, sovereign debt, fixed-income securities, derivatives, counterparty and other forms of credit risk in amounts that are material to their financial condition. as a result of our own business practices and these interdependencies, we and many of our clients have concentrated counterparty exposure to other financial institutions and collective investment funds, particularly large and complex institutions, sovereign issuers, mutual funds and ucits and hedge funds. although we have procedures for monitoring both individual and aggregate counterparty risk, significant individual and aggregate counterparty exposure is inherent in our business, as our focus is on servicing large institutional investors.
in the normal course of our business, we assume concentrated credit risk at the individual obligor, counterparty or group level. such concentrations may be material and can often exceed 10% of our consolidated total shareholders' equity. our material counterparty exposures change daily, and the counterparties or groups of related counterparties to which our risk exposure exceeds
10% of our consolidated total shareholders' equity are also variable during any reported period; however, our largest exposures tend to be to other financial institutions.
concentration of counterparty exposure presents significant risks to us and to our clients because the failure or perceived weakness of our counterparties (or in some cases of our clients' counterparties) has the potential to expose us to risk of financial loss. changes in market perception of the financial strength of particular financial institutions or sovereign issuers can occur rapidly, are often based on a variety of factors and are difficult to predict.
since mid-2007, a variety of economic, market and other factors have contributed to the perception of many financial institutions as being less creditworthy, as reflected in the credit downgrades of numerous large u.s. and non-u.s. financial institutions in recent years. also, credit downgrades to several sovereign issuers (including the u.s., austria, france, greece, italy, the netherlands, portugal and spain) and other issuers have stressed the perceived creditworthiness of financial institutions, many of which invest in, accept collateral in the form of, or value other transactions based on the debt or other securities issued by sovereign or other issuers. economic, political or market turmoil or other developments may lead to stress on sovereign issuers, and increase the potential for sovereign defaults or restructurings, additional credit-rating downgrades or the departure of sovereign issuers from common currencies or economic unions. these same factors may contribute to increased risk of default or downgrading for financial and corporate issuers or other market risks associated with reduced levels of liquidity. as a result, we may be exposed to increased counterparty risks, either resulting from our role as principal or because of commitments we make in our capacity as agent for some of our clients.
additional selected areas where we experience exposure to credit risk include:
•   short-term credit. the degree of client demand for short-term credit tends to increase during periods of market turbulence, which may expose us to further counterparty-related risks. for example, investors in collective investment vehicles for which we act as custodian may experience significant redemption activity due to adverse market or economic news. our relationship with our clients and the nature of the settlement process for some types of payments may result in the extension of short-term credit in such circumstances. for some types of clients, we provide credit to allow them to leverage their portfolios, which may expose
20
us to potential loss if the client experiences investment losses or other credit difficulties.
•   industry and country risks. in addition to our exposure to financial institutions, we are from time to time exposed to concentrated credit risk at an industry or country level. this concentration risk also applies to groups of unrelated counterparties that may have similar investment strategies involving one or more particular industries, regions, or other characteristics. these unrelated counterparties may concurrently experience adverse effects to their performance, liquidity or reputation due to events or other factors affecting such investment strategies. though potentially not material individually (relative to any one such counterparty), our aggregated credit exposures to such a group of counterparties could expose us to a single market or political event or a correlated set of events.
•   unavailability of netting. we are generally not able to net exposures across counterparties that are affiliated entities and may not be able in all circumstances to net exposures to the same legal entity across multiple products. as a consequence, we may incur a loss in relation to one entity or product even though our exposure to an entity's affiliates or across product types is over-collateralized.
•   subcustodian risks. our use of unaffiliated subcustodians exposes us to credit risk, in addition to other risks, such as operational risk, dependencies on credit extensions and risks of the legal systems of the jurisdictions in which the subcustodians operate, each of which risks may be material. these risks are amplified due to changing regulatory requirements with respect to our financial exposures in the event those subcustodians are unable to return a client's assets, including, in some cases, requirements that we be responsible for resulting losses suffered by our clients.
•   settlement risks. we are exposed to settlement risks, particularly in our payments and foreign exchange activities. those activities may lead to losses in the event of a counterparty breach, failure to provide credit extensions or an operational error. due to our membership in several industry clearing or settlement exchanges, we may be required to guarantee obligations and liabilities, or provide financial support, in the event that other members do not honor their obligations or default. moreover, not all of our counterparty exposure is secured, and when our exposure is secured, the realizable value of the collateral may have declined by the time we exercise our rights against that collateral. this risk may be particularly acute if we are required to sell the collateral into an illiquid or temporarily-impaired market.
•   securities lending and repurchase agreement indemnification. on behalf of clients enrolled in our securities lending program, we lend securities to banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. in the event of a failure of the borrower to return such securities, we typically agree to indemnify our clients for the amount by which the fair market value of those securities exceeds the proceeds of the disposition of the collateral recalled from the borrower in connection with such transaction. borrowers are generally required to provide collateral equal to a contractually-agreed percentage equal to or in excess of the fair market value of the loaned securities. as the fair market value of the loaned securities changes, additional collateral is provided by the borrower or collateral is returned to the borrower. in addition, our clients often purchase securities or other financial instruments from financial counterparties, including broker/dealers, under repurchase arrangements, frequently as a method of reinvesting the cash collateral they receive from lending their securities. under these arrangements, the counterparty is obligated to repurchase these securities or financial instruments from the client at the same price (plus an agreed rate of return) at some point in the future. the value of the collateral is intended to exceed the counterparty's payment obligation, and collateral is adjusted daily to account for shortfall under, or excess over, the agreed-upon collateralization level. as with the securities lending program, we agree to indemnify our clients from any loss that would arise on a default by the counterparty under these repurchase arrangements if the proceeds from the disposition of the securities or other financial assets held as collateral are less than the amount of the repayment obligation by the client's counterparty. in such instances of counterparty default, for both securities lending and repurchase agreements, we, rather than our client, are exposed to the risks associated with collateral value.
21
•   stable value arrangements. we provide benefit-responsive contracts, known as wraps, to defined contribution plans that offer a stable value option to their participants. during the financial crisis, the book value of obligations under many of these contracts exceeded the market value of the underlying portfolio holdings. concerns regarding the portfolio of investments protected by such contracts, or regarding the investment manager overseeing such an investment option, may result in redemption demands from stable value products covered by benefit-responsive contracts at a time when the portfolio's market value is less than its book value, potentially exposing us to risk of loss.
•   u.s. municipal obligations remarketing credit facilities. we provide credit facilities in connection with the remarketing of u.s. municipal obligations, potentially exposing us to credit exposure to the municipalities issuing such bonds and to their increased liquidity demands. in the current economic environment, where municipalities are subject to increased investor concern, the risks associated with such businesses increase.
•   senior secured bank loans. in recent years, we have increased our investment in senior secured bank loans. we invest in these loans to non-investment grade borrowers through participation in loan syndications in the non-investment grade lending market. we rate these loans as "speculative" under our internal risk-rating framework, and these loans have significant exposure to credit losses relative to higher-rated loans. we are therefore at a higher risk of default with respect to these investments relative to other of our investments activities. in addition, unlike other financial institutions that may have an active role in managing individual loan compliance, our investment in these loans is generally as a passive investor with limited control. as our investment in these loans has increased, we have also experienced increases in our provision for loan losses. as this portfolio grows and becomes more seasoned, our allowance for loan losses related to these loans may increase through additional provisions for credit losses.
under evolving regulatory restrictions on credit exposure, which are anticipated to include broader or more prescriptive measures of credit exposure, we may be required to limit our exposures to specific issuers or groups, including financial institutions and sovereign issuers, to levels that we may currently exceed. these credit exposure restrictions under such evolving regulations may adversely affect our businesses, may require that we expand our credit exposure to a broader range of issuers, including issuers that represent increased credit risk and may require that we modify our operating models or the policies and practices we use to manage our consolidated statement of condition. the effects of these considerations may increase when evaluated under a stressed environment in stress testing, including ccar. in addition, we are an adherent to the new isda 2015 universal resolution stay protocol and as such are subject to restrictions against the exercise of rights and remedies against fellow adherents, including other major financial institutions, in the event they or an affiliate of theirs enters into resolution. although our overall business is subject to these interdependencies, several of our business units are particularly sensitive to them, including our global treasury group, that, among other responsibilities, manages our investment portfolio, our currency trading business, our securities finance business, and our investment management business. given the limited number of strong counterparties in the current market, we are not able to mitigate all of our and our clients' counterparty credit risk.
our investment securities portfolio, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in market factors including interest rates, credit spreads and credit performance.
our investment securities portfolio represented approximately 41% of our consolidated total assets as of december 31, 2015. the gross interest revenue associated with our investment portfolio represented approximately 18% of our consolidated total gross revenue for the year ended december 31, 2015 and has represented as much as 30% of our consolidated gross revenue in the fiscal years since 2007. as such, our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are materially exposed to the risks associated with our investment portfolio, including, without limitation, changes in interest rates, credit spreads, credit performance, credit ratings, our access to liquidity, foreign exchange markets, mark-to-market valuations, and our ability to profitably reinvest repayments of principal with respect to these securities. despite recent increases to interest rates in the united states, the continued low interest-rate environment that has persisted since the financial crisis began in mid-2007, and may continue in 2016 and beyond, limits our ability to achieve a net interest margin consistent with our historical averages. in addition, new and proposed regulatory liquidity standards, such as the lcr, require that we maintain
22
minimum levels of high quality liquid assets in our investment portfolio, which generally generate lower rates of return than other investment assets, resulting in a negative impact on our net interest revenue and our net interest margin. for additional information regarding these liquidity requirements, refer to the "liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio" section of "supervision and regulation" in item 1, "business" in this form 10-k. we may enter into derivative transactions to hedge or manage our exposure to interest rate risk, as well as other risks, such as foreign currency exchange risk and credit risk. derivative instruments that we hold for these or other purposes may not achieve their intended results and could result in unexpected losses or stresses on our liquidity or capital resources.
our investment securities portfolio represents a greater proportion of our consolidated statement of condition and our loan and lease portfolios represent a smaller proportion (approximately 8% of our consolidated total assets as of december 31, 2015), in comparison to many other major financial institutions. in some respects, the accounting and regulatory treatment of our investment securities portfolio may be less favorable to us than a more traditional held-for-investment lending portfolio. for example, under the u.s. basel iii final rule issued in july 2013, after-tax changes in the fair value of afs investment securities are included in tier 1 capital. since loans held for investment are not subject to a fair-value accounting framework, changes in the fair value of loans (other than incurred credit losses) are not similarly included in the determination of tier 1 capital under the u.s. basel iii final rule. due to this differing treatment, we may experience increased variability in our tier 1 capital relative to other major financial institutions whose loan-and-lease portfolios represent a larger proportion of their consolidated total assets than ours.
additional selected risks associated with our investment portfolio include:
•   asset class concentration. our investment portfolio continues to have significant concentrations in several classes of securities, including agency residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities, and securities with concentrated exposure to consumers. these classes and types of securities experienced significant liquidity, valuation and credit quality deterioration during the financial crisis that began in mid-2007. we also hold non-u.s. mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities with exposures to european countries, whose sovereign-debt markets have experienced increased stress since
2011 and may continue to experience stress in the future. for further information, refer to the risk factor titled "our businesses have significant european operations, and disruptions in european economies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition".
further, we hold a portfolio of u.s. state and municipal bonds. in view of the budget deficits that a number of states and municipalities currently face, the risks associated with this portfolio are significant.
•   effects of market conditions. if market conditions deteriorate, our investment portfolio could experience a decline in liquidity and market value, regardless of our credit view of our portfolio holdings. for example, we recorded significant losses not related to credit in connection with the consolidation of our off-balance sheet asset-backed commercial paper conduits in 2009 and the repositioning of our investment portfolio in 2010. in addition, in general, deterioration in credit quality, or changes in management's expectations regarding repayment timing or in management's investment intent to hold securities to maturity, in each case with respect to our portfolio holdings, could result in other-than-temporary impairment. similarly, if a material portion of our investment portfolio were to experience credit deterioration our capital ratios as calculated pursuant to the basel iii final rule could be adversely affected. this risk is greater with portfolios of investment securities than with holdings of u.s. treasury securities.
•   effects of interest rates. our investment portfolio is further subject to changes in both u.s. and non-u.s. (primarily in europe) interest rates, and could be negatively affected by changes in those rates, whether or not expected, particularly by a quicker-than-anticipated increase in interest rates or by monetary policy that results in persistently low or negative rates of interest. this has been the case, for example, with respect to ecb monetary policy, including negative interest rates in some jurisdictions, with associated negative effects on our net interest revenue and net interest margin. the effect on our net interest revenue has been exacerbated by the effects of the strong u.s. dollar relative to other currencies, particularly the euro. if ecb monetary policy continues to pressure european interest rates
23
downward and the u.s. dollar remains strong or strengthens, the negative effects on our net interest revenue likely will continue or increase.
our business activities expose us to interest-rate risk.
in our business activities, we assume interest-rate risk by investing short-term deposits received from our clients in our investment portfolio of longer- and intermediate-term assets. our net interest revenue and net interest margin are affected by among other things, the levels of interest rates in global markets, changes in the relationship between short- and long-term interest rates, the direction and speed of interest-rate changes, and the asset and liability spreads relative to the currency and geographic mix of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. these factors are influenced, among other things, by a variety of economic and market forces and expectations, including monetary policy and other activities of central banks, such as the federal reserve, that we do not control. our ability to anticipate changes in these factors or to hedge the related on- and off-balance sheet exposures can significantly influence the success of our asset-and-liability management activities and the resulting level of our net interest revenue and net interest margin. the impact of changes in interest rates and related factors will depend on the relative duration and fixed- or floating-rate nature of our assets and liabilities. sustained lower interest rates, a flat or inverted yield curve and narrow credit spreads generally have a constraining effect on our net interest revenue. in addition, our ability to change deposit rates in response to changes in interest rates and other market and related factors is limited by client relationship considerations. for additional information about the effects on interest rates on our business, refer to "financial condition - market risk management - asset-and-liability management activities" in management's discussion and analysis included under item 7 of this form 10-k.
if we are unable to effectively manage our liquidity, including by continuously attracting deposits and other short-term funding, our consolidated financial condition, including our regulatory capital ratios, our consolidated results of operations and our business prospects, could be adversely affected.
liquidity management, including on an intra-day basis, is critical to the management of our consolidated statement of condition and to our ability to service our client base. we generally use our liquidity to:
•   meet clients' demands for return of their deposits;
•   extend credit to our clients in connection with our custody business; and
•   fund the pool of long- and intermediate-term assets that are included in the investment securities carried in our consolidated statement of condition.
because the demand for credit by our clients is difficult to predict and control, and may be at its peak at times of disruption in the securities markets, and because the average maturity of our investment securities portfolio is longer than the contractual maturity of our client deposit base, we need to continuously attract, and are dependent on access to, various sources of short-term funding. during periods of market disruption, the level of client deposits held by us has in recent years tended to increase; however, since such deposits are considered to be transitory, we have historically deposited so-called excess deposits with u.s. and non-u.s. central banks and in other highly liquid but low-yielding instruments. these levels of excess client deposits, as a consequence, have increased our net interest revenue but have adversely affected our net interest margin.
during 2015, we took action to better balance our clients' cash management needs with our economic and regulatory objectives. these efforts contributed to a reduction of interest and non-interest bearing client deposits. while efforts of this nature may help to decrease the levels of excess deposits in the near-term, we continue to anticipate higher levels of client deposits irrespective of the interest rate environment, particularly during periods of market stress. in addition, our efforts to better balance our clients' cash management needs with our economic and regulatory objectives could result in some clients altering their cash management strategies over time, which exposes us to the risk that those clients may in the medium or long term reduce their client deposit balances available to fund the pool of assets included in our investment securities portfolio. this could adversely affect our net interest revenue.
in managing our liquidity, our primary source of short-term funding is client deposits, which are predominantly transaction-based deposits by institutional investors. our ability to continue to attract these deposits, and other short-term funding sources such as certificates of deposit and commercial paper, is subject to variability based on a number of factors, including volume and volatility in global financial markets, the relative interest rates that we are prepared to pay for these deposits, the perception of safety of these deposits or short-term obligations relative to alternative short-term investments available to our clients, including the capital markets, and the classification of certain
24
deposits for regulatory purposes and related discussions we may have from time to time with clients regarding better balancing our clients' cash management needs with our economic and regulatory objectives.
the parent company is a non-operating holding company. to effectively manage our liquidity we routinely transfer assets among affiliated entities, subsidiaries and branches. internal or external factors, such as government regulations, influence our liquidity management and may limit our ability to effectively transfer liquidity internally which could, among other things, restrict our ability to fund operations, dividends or stock repurchases, require us to seek external and potentially more costly capital and impact our liquidity position. in addition, we may be exposed to liquidity or other risks in managing asset pools for third parties that are funded on a short-term basis, or for which the clients participating in these products have a right to the return of cash or assets on limited notice. these business activities include, among others, securities finance collateral pools, money market and other short-term investment funds and liquidity facilities utilized in connection with municipal bond programs. if clients demand a return of their cash or assets, particularly on limited notice, and these investment pools do not have the liquidity to support those demands, we could be forced to sell investment securities at unfavorable prices, damaging our reputation as an asset manager and potentially exposing us to claims related to our management of the pools.
the availability and cost of credit in short-term markets are highly dependent on the markets' perception of our liquidity and creditworthiness. our efforts to monitor and manage our liquidity risk, including on an intra-day basis, may not be successful or sufficient to deal with dramatic or unanticipated changes in the global securities markets or other event-driven reductions in liquidity. as a result of such events, among other things, our cost of funds may increase, thereby reducing our net interest revenue, or we may need to dispose of a portion of our investment securities portfolio, which, depending on market conditions, could result in a loss from such sales of investment securities being recorded in our consolidated statement of income.
our business and capital-related activities, including our ability to return capital to shareholders and purchase our capital stock, may be adversely affected by our implementation of the revised regulatory capital and liquidity standards that we must meet under the basel iii final rule, the dodd-frank act and other regulatory initiatives, or in the event our capital plan or post-stress capital ratios are determined to be insufficient as a result of regulatory capital stress testing.
basel iii and dodd-frank on january 1, 2015, the u.s. basel iii final rule replaced the existing basel i-based approach for calculating risk-weighted assets with the u.s. basel iii standardized approach that, among other things, modifies certain existing risk weights and introduces new methods for calculating risk-weighted assets for certain types of assets and exposures. the final rule also revised the basel ii-based advanced approaches capital rules to implement basel iii. as a so-called "advanced approaches" banking organization, state street became subject to the u.s. basel iii final rule on january 1, 2014.
the u.s. basel iii final rule also implemented certain provisions of the dodd-frank act. the dodd-frank act applies a "capital floor" to advanced approaches banking organizations, such as state street and state street bank. as of january 1, 2015, the basel iii standardized approach acts as that capital floor. as a result, we are required to calculate our risk-based capital ratios under both the basel iii advanced approaches and the basel iii standardized approach, and we are subject to the more stringent of the risk-based capital ratios calculated under the standardized approach and those calculated under the advanced approaches in the assessment of our capital adequacy, including under the prompt corrective action framework.
in implementing certain aspects of these capital regulations, we are making interpretations of the regulatory intent. the federal reserve may determine that we are not in compliance with certain aspects of the advanced approaches capital rules and may require us to take certain actions to come into compliance that could adversely affect our business operations, our regulatory capital structure, our capital ratios or our financial performance, or otherwise restrict our growth plans or strategies. in addition, banking regulators could change the basel iii final rule or their interpretations as they apply to us, including changes to these standards or interpretations made in regulations implementing provisions of the dodd-frank act, which could adversely affect us and our ability to comply with the basel iii final rule.

along with the u.s. basel iii final rule, banking regulators also introduced additional new requirements, such as the slr and lcr. in addition, further capital and liquidity requirements are under consideration by u.s. and international banking regulators, such as an nsfr, each of which has the potential to have significant effects on our capital and liquidity planning and activities.
for example, the specification of the various elements of the u.s. lcr in the final rule, such as the eligibility of assets as high-quality liquid assets, the calculation of net outflows, including the treatment of operational deposits, and the timing of indeterminate maturities, could have a material effect on our business activities, including the management and composition of our investment securities portfolio and our ability to extend committed contingent credit facilities to our clients. the full effects of the basel iii final rule, and of other regulatory initiatives related to capital or liquidity, on state street and state street bank are subject to further regulatory guidance, action or rule-making.
systemic importance as a g-sib, we generally expect to be held to the most stringent provisions under the u.s. basel iii final rule. for example, on august 14, 2015, the federal reserve published a final rule on the implementation of capital requirements for u.s. g-sibs, and on october 30, 2015, the federal reserve released its proposed tlac and ltd requirements for u.s. g-sibs. for additional information on these requirements, refer to the "regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity standards" section under "supervision and regulation" in item 1, "business" of this form 10-k.
not all of our competitors have similarly been designated as systemically important, and therefore some of our competitors are not subject to the same additional capital requirements.
ccar we are required by the federal reserve to conduct periodic stress testing of our business operations and to develop an annual capital plan as part of the federal reserve's comprehensive capital analysis and review process. that process is used by the federal reserve to evaluate our management of capital, the adequacy of our regulatory capital and the potential requirement for us to maintain capital levels above regulatory minimums. the planned capital actions in our capital plan, including stock purchases and dividends, may be objected to by the federal reserve, potentially requiring us to revise our stress-testing or capital management approaches, resubmit our capital plan or postpone, cancel or alter our planned capital actions. in addition, changes in our business strategy, merger or acquisition activity or unanticipated uses of capital could result in a change in our capital plan and its associated capital actions, and may require resubmission of the capital plan to the federal reserve for its non-objection. we are also subject to asset quality reviews and stress testing by the ecb and may in the future to be subject to similar reviews and testing by other regulators.
our implementation of the new capital and liquidity requirements, including our capital plan, may not be approved or may be objected to by the federal reserve, and the federal reserve may impose capital requirements in excess of our expectations or require us to maintain levels of liquidity that are higher than we may expect, and which may adversely affect our consolidated revenues. in the event that our implementation of new capital and liquidity requirements under the basel iii final rule, the dodd-frank act or other regulatory initiatives or our current capital structure are determined not to conform with current and future capital requirements, our ability to deploy capital in the operation of our business or our ability to distribute capital to shareholders or to purchase our capital stock may be constrained, and our business may be adversely affected. in addition, we may choose to forgo business opportunities, due to their impact on our capital plan or stress tests, including ccar. likewise, in the event that regulators in other jurisdictions in which we have banking subsidiaries determine that our capital or liquidity levels do not conform with current and future regulatory requirements, our ability to deploy capital, our levels of liquidity or our business operations in those jurisdictions may be adversely affected.
for additional information about the above matters, refer to "business - supervision and regulation - regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity standards" included under item 1, and "financial condition - capital" in management's discussion and analysis included under item 7 of this form 10-k.
fee revenue represents a significant majority of our consolidated revenue and is subject to decline, among other things, in the event of a reduction in, or changes to, the level or type of investment activity by our clients.
we rely primarily on fee-based services to derive our revenue. this contrasts with commercial banks that may rely more heavily on interest-based sources of revenue, such as loans. during 2015 total fee revenue represented approximately 80% of our total consolidated revenue. fee revenue generated by our investment servicing and investment management businesses is augmented by trading services, securities finance and processing fees and other revenue.
26
the level of these fees is influenced by several factors, including the mix and volume of our assets under custody and administration and our assets under management, the value and type of securities positions held (with respect to assets under custody) and the volume of portfolio transactions, and the types of products and services used by our clients. for example, reductions in the level of economic and capital markets activity tend to have a negative effect on our fee revenue, as these often result in reduced asset valuations and transaction volumes. they may also result in investor preference trends towards asset classes and markets deemed more secure, such as cash or non-emerging markets, with respect to which our fee rates are often lower.
in addition, our clients include institutional investors, such as mutual funds, collective investment funds, hedge funds and other investment pools, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations, endowments and investment managers. economic, market or other factors that reduce the level or rates of savings in or with those institutions, either through reductions in financial asset valuations or through changes in investor preferences, could materially reduce our fee revenue and have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. these clients also, by their nature, are often able to exert considerable market influence, and this, combined with strong competitive forces in the markets for our services, has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant pressure to reduce the fees we charge for our services in both our asset servicing and asset management business lines.
our businesses have significant european operations, and disruptions in european economies could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
since 2011, several european economies have experienced, and in the future may experience, difficulties in financing their deficits and servicing their outstanding debt. instability and sovereign debt concerns, and the downgraded credit ratings of associated sovereign debt and european financial institutions, have contributed to volatility in the financial markets. throughout 2015 the european central bank has further reduced interest rates below zero and continued with purchasing european sovereign debt and other quantitative easing measures to support economic growth and employment. the divergence between u.s. and european monetary policy has led to increased uncertainty around the strength of the european economies and strength of the euro. numerous european governments, have adopted austerity and other measures in an attempt to contain budget deficits. current popular and political attitudes towards economic austerity programs in europe appear to be diverging, creating the potential for an increasingly complex political environment in which actions to support european economies need to be resolved.
during the last two quarters of 2015 europe has experienced an unprecedented mass-migration of refugees from the middle east and africa. this is placing significant pressures on governments, society and budget across europe. the conflict between ukraine and russia has led to increased geopolitical pressure, with governments globally imposing trade restrictions which affect the global and european economy, the russian currency and russian financial markets and financial institutions. finally, terrorist threat has increased significantly in europe, as demonstrated by the paris attacks, which adds to economic uncertainty.
the current geo-political and economic uncertainty create ongoing concern regarding deflationary pressures in europe, persistent high levels of unemployment in certain countries and the stability of the euro, european financial markets generally and certain institutions in particular. given the scope of our european operations, clients and counterparties, disruptions in the european financial markets, the failure to resolve fully and contain sovereign-debt concerns, continued recession in significant european economies, the possible attempt of a country to abandon the euro, independence movements (e.g. scotland, catalonia and britain) the failure of a significant european financial institution, even if not an immediate counterparty to us, or persistent weakness in the euro and the consequences of prolonged negative interest rates, could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
recent geopolitical and economic conditions have adversely affected us, and they have increased the uncertainty and unpredictability we face in managing our businesses.
global credit and other financial markets have recently suffered from substantial volatility, illiquidity and disruption. the resulting economic pressure and lack of confidence in the financial stability of certain countries, and in the financial markets generally, have adversely affected our business, as well as the businesses of our clients and our significant counterparties. this environment, the potential for continuing or additional disruptions, and the regulatory and enforcement environment that has subsequently arisen have also affected overall confidence in financial institutions, have further exacerbated liquidity and pricing issues within the securities markets, have increased the uncertainty
27
and unpredictability we face in managing our businesses, and have had an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
numerous global financial services firms and the sovereign debt of some nations experienced credit downgrades and recessionary issues in 2015. the occurrence of additional disruptions in global markets, the worsening of economic conditions, continued economic or political uncertainty in europe or in emerging markets, volatility in the price of oil or prolonged instability in china and other regions, could further adversely affect our businesses and the financial services industry in general, and also increase the difficulty and unpredictability of aligning our business strategies, our infrastructure and our operating costs in light of current and future market and economic conditions.
market disruptions can adversely affect our consolidated results of operations if the value of assets under custody, administration or management decline, while the costs of providing the related services remain constant. these factors can reduce the profitability of our asset-based fee revenue and could also adversely affect our transaction-based revenue, such as revenues from securities finance and foreign exchange activities, and the volume of transactions that we execute for or with our clients. further, the degree of volatility in foreign exchange rates can affect our foreign exchange trading revenue. in general, increased currency volatility tends to increase our market risk but also increases our foreign exchange revenue. conversely, periods of lower currency volatility tend to decrease our market risk but also decrease our foreign exchange revenue.
in addition, as our business grows globally and a significant percentage of our revenue is earned (and of our expenses paid) in currencies other than u.s. dollars, our exposure to foreign currency volatility could affect our levels of consolidated revenue, our consolidated expenses and our consolidated results of operations, as well as the value of our investment in our non-u.s. operations and our investment portfolio holdings. for example, throughout 2015 the effect of a stronger u.s. dollar, particularly relative to the euro, reduced our servicing fee and management fee revenue and also reduced our expenses. the extent to which changes in the strength of the u.s. dollar relative to other currencies affects our consolidated results of operations, including the degree of any offset between increases or decreases to both revenue and expenses, will depend upon the nature and scope of our operations and activities in the relevant jurisdictions during the relevant periods, which may vary from period to period.
as our product offerings expand, in part as we seek to take advantage of perceived opportunities arising under various regulatory reforms and resulting market changes, the degree of our exposure to various market and credit risks will evolve, potentially resulting in greater revenue volatility. we also will need to make additional investments to develop the operational infrastructure and to enhance our compliance and risk management capabilities to support these businesses, which may increase the operating expenses of such businesses or, if our control environment fails to keep pace with product expansion, result in increased risk of loss from such businesses.
we may need to raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms.
we may need to raise additional capital in order to maintain our credit ratings in response to regulatory changes, including capital rules, or for other purposes, including financing acquisitions and joint ventures. however, our ability to access the capital markets, if needed, will depend on a number of factors, including the state of the financial markets. in the event of rising interest rates, disruptions in financial markets, negative perceptions of our business or our financial strength, or other factors that would increase our cost of borrowing, we cannot be sure of our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, on terms acceptable to us. any diminished ability to raise additional capital, if needed, could adversely affect our business and our ability to implement our business plan, capital plan and strategic goals, including the financing of acquisitions and joint ventures.
any downgrades in our credit ratings, or an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength, could adversely affect our borrowing costs, capital costs and liquidity and cause reputational harm.
major independent rating agencies publish credit ratings for our debt obligations based on their evaluation of a number of factors, some of which relate to our performance and other corporate developments, including financings, acquisitions and joint ventures, and some of which relate to general industry conditions. we anticipate that the rating agencies will review our ratings regularly based on our consolidated results of operations and developments in our businesses. one or more of the major independent credit rating agencies have in the past downgraded, and may in the future downgrade, our credit ratings, or have negatively revised their outlook for our credit ratings. in december 2015, standard & poor's downgraded the senior unsecured
28
and subordinated debt of state street corporation and the subordinated debt of state street bank.
the current market environment and our exposure to financial institutions and other counterparties, including sovereign entities, increase the risk that we may not maintain our current ratings, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to maintain our current credit ratings. downgrades in our credit ratings may adversely affect our borrowing costs, our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. a failure to maintain an acceptable credit rating may also preclude us from being competitive in various products.
additionally, our counterparties, as well as our clients, rely on our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us. if we experience diminished financial strength or stability, actual or perceived, including the effects of market or regulatory developments, our announced or rumored business developments or consolidated results of operations, a decline in our stock price or a reduced credit rating, our counterparties may be less willing to enter into transactions, secured or unsecured, with us; our clients may reduce or place limits on the level of services we provide them or seek other service providers; or our prospective clients may select other service providers, all of which may have other adverse effects on our reputation.
the risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy relative to other market participants is higher in the current market environment, in which the consolidation, and in some instances failure, of financial institutions, including major global financial institutions, have resulted in a smaller number of much larger counterparties and competitors. if our counterparties perceive us to be a less viable counterparty, our ability to enter into financial transactions on terms acceptable to us or our clients, on our or our clients' behalf, will be materially compromised. if our clients reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services we provide to them, our revenues will decrease accordingly.
operational, business and reputational risks we face extensive and changing government regulation in the u.s. and in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, which may increase our costs and expose us to risks related to compliance.
most of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by multiple regulatory bodies, and many of the clients to which we provide services are themselves subject to a broad range of regulatory requirements. these regulations may affect the scope of, and the manner and terms of delivery of, our services. as a financial institution with substantial international operations, we are subject to extensive regulation and supervisory oversight, both in and outside of the u.s. this regulation and supervisory oversight affects, among other things, the scope of our activities and client services, our capital and organizational structure, our ability to fund the operations of our subsidiaries, our lending practices, our dividend policy, our common stock purchase actions, the manner in which we market our services, and our interactions with foreign regulatory agencies and officials.
in particular, state street is registered with the federal reserve as a bank holding company pursuant to the bank holding company act of 1956. the bank holding company act limits the activities in which we (and non-banking entities that we are deemed to control under that act) may engage in activities the federal reserve considers to be closely related to banking or to managing or controlling banks. financial holding company status expands the activities permissible for a bank holding company to those that are deemed to be "financial in nature" by the federal reserve. state street elected to become a financial holding company under the bank holding company act. financial holding company status requires state street and its banking subsidiaries to remain well capitalized and well managed and to comply with community reinvestment act obligations. currently, under the bank holding company act, we may not be able to engage in new activities or acquire shares or control of other businesses.
several other aspects of the regulatory environment in which we operate, and related risks, are discussed below. additional information is provided in "business - supervision and regulation" included under item 1 of this form 10-k.
dodd-frank act the dodd-frank act, which became law in july 2010, has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on the regulatory structure of the global financial markets and has imposed, and is expected to continue to impose, significant additional costs on us. several elements of the dodd-frank act, such as the volcker rule and enhanced prudential standards for financial institutions designated as sifis, impose or are expected to impose significant additional operational, compliance and risk management costs both in the near-term, as we develop and integrate appropriate systems and procedures, and on a recurring basis thereafter, as we monitor, support and refine those systems and procedures.
a number of regulations implementing the dodd-frank act that are not yet final are anticipated to be finalized in 2016 or 2017, with compliance dates soon
29
thereafter, and, as a result of and together with regulatory change in europe, the costs and impact on our operations of the post-financial crisis regulatory reform are accelerating. we may not anticipate completely all areas in which the dodd-frank act or other regulatory initiatives could affect our business or influence our future activities or the full effects or extent of related operational, compliance, risk management or other costs.
other provisions of the dodd-frank act and its implementing regulations, such as new rules for swap market participants, additional regulation of financial system utilities, the designation of non-bank institutions as sifis, and further requirements to facilitate orderly liquidation of large institutions, could adversely affect our business operations and our competitive position, and could also negatively affect the operational and competitive positions of our clients. the final effects of the dodd-frank act on our business will depend largely on the scope and timing of the implementation of the dodd-frank act by regulatory bodies, which in many cases have been delayed, and the exercise of discretion by these regulatory bodies.
resolution planning state street corporation, like other bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, periodically submits a plan for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure--commonly referred to as a resolution plan or a living will--to the federal reserve and the fdic under section 165(d) of the dodd-frank act. we submitted our 2015 resolution plan to the federal reserve and the fdic on july 1, 2015. through resolution planning, we seek, in the event of the insolvency, to maintain state street bank's role as a key infrastructure provider within the financial system, while minimizing risk to the financial system and maximizing value for the benefit of our stakeholders. we have and will continue to focus management attention and resources to meet regulatory expectations with respect to resolution planning. as set out in its 2015 resolution plan, in the event of material financial distress or failure, our preferred resolution strategy, referred to as the single point of entry strategy, provides for the recapitalization of state street bank by the parent company (for example, by forgiving inter-company indebtedness of state street bank owed to the parent company) prior to the parent company's entry into bankruptcy proceedings. the recapitalization is intended to enable state street bank and its material subsidiaries to continue operating. under this single point of entry strategy, state street bank and its material entity subsidiaries would not themselves enter into resolution proceedings; they would instead be transferred to a newly organized holding company held by a reorganization trust for the benefit of the parent company's claimants. in the event that such recapitalization actions occur, the parent company's financial condition would be adversely impacted and equity and debt holders of the parent company, may, as a consequence, be in a worse position than if the recapitalization did not occur.
in 2014, the federal reserve and the fdic announced the completion of their reviews of the resolution plans submitted in 2013 by 11 large, complex banking organizations, including state street, under the requirements of the dodd-frank act, and informed each of these organizations of specific shortcomings with their respective 2013 resolution plans. if the fdic and the federal reserve should determine that one or more of our 2015 or any subsequent resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the bankruptcy code, or we otherwise fail to meet regulatory expectations to the satisfaction of the federal reserve and the fdic with respect to one or more of such resolution plans, we could be subject to more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements, restrictions on our growth, activities or operations, or be required to divest certain of our assets or operations.
volcker rule u.s. banking regulators have issued final regulations to implement the volcker rule. the volcker rule will, over time, prohibit banking entities, including us and our affiliates, from engaging in specified prohibited proprietary trading activities, subject to exemptions, including for market-making-related activities and risk-mitigating hedging. the volcker rule will also require banking entities to either restructure or divest specified ownership interests in, and relationships with, covered funds, within the meaning of the final volcker rule regulations.
whether various investment securities or structures, such as clos constitute covered funds, as defined in the final volcker rule regulations, and do not benefit from the exemptions provided in the volcker rule, and whether a banking organization's investments therein constitute ownership interests remain subject to (1) market, and ultimately regulatory, interpretation, and (2) the specific terms and other characteristics relevant to such investment securities and structures. we hold significant investments in clos. in the event that we or our banking regulators conclude that such investments in clos, or other investments, are covered funds, we may be required to divest of such investments. if other banking entities reach similar conclusions with respect to similar investments held by them, the prices of such investments could decline significantly, and we may be required to divest of such investments
30
at a significant discount compared to the investments' book value. this could result in a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or on our consolidated financial condition in the period in which such a divestiture occurs.
the final volcker rule regulations also require banking entities to establish extensive programs designed to ensure compliance with the restrictions of the volcker rule. we have established a compliance program which complies with the final volcker rule regulations as currently in effect. such compliance program restricts our ability in the future to service various types of funds, in particular covered funds for which ssga acts as an advisor and specified types of trustee relationships. consequently, volcker rule compliance entails both the cost of a compliance program and loss of certain revenue and future opportunities.
systemic importance our qualification under the dodd-frank act in the u.s. as a sifi, and our designation by the fsb as a g-sib, to which certain regulatory capital surcharges may apply, will subject us to incrementally higher capital and prudential requirements, increased scrutiny of our activities and potential further regulatory requirements or increased regulatory expectations than those applicable to some of the financial institutions with which we compete as a custodian or asset manager. this qualification and designation also has significantly increased, and may continue to increase, our expenses associated with regulatory compliance, including personnel and systems, as well as implementation and related costs to enhance our programs.
non-u.s. regulatory requirements the breadth of our business activities, together with the scope of our global operations and varying business practices in relevant jurisdictions, increase the complexity and costs of meeting our regulatory compliance obligations, including in areas that are receiving significant regulatory scrutiny. we are, therefore, subject to related risks of non-compliance, including fines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory sanctions or difficulties in obtaining approvals, limitations on our business activities, or reputational harm, any of which may be significant. for example, the global nature of our client base requires us to comply with complex regulations relating to money laundering and anti-terrorist monitoring of our clients. the same applies with respect to anti-corruption laws and related requirements. regulatory scrutiny of compliance with these and other regulations is increasing and our operations are subject to regulations from multiple jurisdictions. the overall evolving regulatory landscape in each jurisdiction in which we operate, including requirements or restrictions on our service offerings or opportunities for new service offerings, particularly when applied on a cross-border basis, is not necessarily consistent with the requirements or regulatory objectives of other jurisdictions in which we have clients or operations. this evolving regulatory landscape may interfere with our ability to conduct our operations, with our pursuit of a common global operating model or with our ability to compete effectively with other financial institutions operating in those jurisdictions or which may be subject to different regulatory requirements than apply to us. in particular, non-u.s. regulation and initiatives may be inconsistent or conflict with current or proposed regulations in the u.s., which could create increased compliance and other costs that would adversely affect business, operations or profitability.
in addition to u.s. regulatory initiatives such as the dodd-frank act and implementation of the basel iii final rule, including the basel iii slr and the proposed nsfr, we are further affected by non-u.s. regulatory initiatives, including, but not limited to, the implemented aifmd, the european bank recovery and resolution directive, the emir which is currently in an implementation phase, proposed revisions to the european undertakings for the collective investment fund in transferable securities directive, or ucits, proposed revisions to the mifid and revisions to the european union data protection directive. recent, proposed or potential regulations in the u.s. and europe with respect to money market funds, short-term wholesale funding, such as repurchase agreements or securities lending, or other "shadow banking" activities, could also adversely affect not only our own operations but also the operations of the clients to which we provide services. in europe, the aifmd increases the responsibilities and potential liabilities of custodians to certain of their clients for asset losses, and proposed revisions to the regulations affecting ucits are anticipated to incorporate similar, potentially more strict, standards.
emir requires the reporting of all derivatives to a trade repository, the mandatory clearing of certain derivatives trades via a central counterparty and risk mitigation techniques for derivatives not cleared via a central counterparty. emir will continue to impact our business activities, and increase costs, in various ways, some of which may be adverse. further, the european commission's proposal to introduce a proposed financial transaction tax or similar proposals elsewhere, if adopted, could materially affect the location and volume of financial transactions or otherwise alter the conduct of financial activities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
31
consequences of regulatory environment and compliance risks the dodd-frank act and these other international regulatory changes could limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, increase our regulatory capital requirements, alter the risk profile of certain of our core activities and impose additional costs on us, otherwise adversely affect our business, our consolidated results of operations or financial condition and have other negative consequences, including a reduction of our credit ratings. different countries may respond to the market and economic environment in different and potentially conflicting manners, which could increase the cost of compliance for us.
the evolving regulatory environment, including changes to existing regulations and the introduction of new regulations, may also contribute to decisions we may make to suspend, reduce or withdraw from existing businesses, activities or initiatives. in addition to potential lost revenue associated with any such suspensions, reductions or withdrawals, any such suspensions, reductions or withdrawals may result in significant restructuring or related costs or exposures.
if we do not comply with governmental regulations, we may be subject to fines, penalties, lawsuits, delays, or difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals or restrictions on our business activities or harm to our reputation, which may significantly and adversely affect our business operations and, in turn, our consolidated results of operations. the willingness of regulatory authorities to impose meaningful sanctions, and the level of fines and penalties imposed in connection with regulatory violations, have increased substantially since the financial crisis. regulatory agencies may, at times, limit our ability to disclose their findings, related actions or remedial measures. similarly, many of our clients are subject to significant regulatory requirements and retain our services in order for us to assist them in complying with those legal requirements. changes in these regulations can significantly affect the services that we are asked to provide, as well as our costs.
adverse publicity and damage to our reputation arising from the failure or perceived failure to comply with legal, regulatory or contractual requirements could affect our ability to attract and retain clients. if we cause clients to fail to comply with these regulatory requirements, we may be liable to them for losses and expenses that they incur. in recent years, regulatory oversight and enforcement have increased substantially, imposing additional costs and increasing the potential risks associated with our operations. if this regulatory trend continues, it could adversely affect our operations and, in turn, our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
for additional information, see the risk factor below, "our businesses may be adversely affected by regulatory enforcement and litigation."
our calculations of credit, market and operational risk exposures, total risk-weighted assets and capital ratios for regulatory purposes depend on data inputs, formulae, models, correlations, and assumptions that are subject to changes over time, which changes, in addition to our consolidated financial results, could materially change our risk exposures, our total risk-weighted assets and our capital ratios from period to period.
to calculate our credit, market and operational risk exposures, our total risk-weighted assets and our capital ratios for regulatory purposes, the basel iii final rule involves the use of current and historical data, including our own loss data and claims experience and similar information from other industry participants, market volatility measures, interest rates and spreads, asset valuations, credit exposures, and the creditworthiness of our counterparties. these calculations also involve the use of quantitative formulae, statistical models, historical correlations and significant assumptions. we refer to the data, formulae, models, correlations, and assumptions, as well as our related internal processes, as our "advanced systems." while our advanced systems are generally quantitative in nature, significant components involve the exercise of judgment based, among other factors, on our and the financial services industry's evolving experience. any of these judgments or other elements of our advanced systems may not, individually or collectively, precisely represent or calculate the scenarios, circumstances, outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended.
in addition, our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences, forces and events experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions, changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors, and are also subject to continuing regulatory review and approval. for example, a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution, even if we do not experience a related loss, could result in a material change in our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures, our total risk-weighted assets and our capital ratios compared to prior periods. due to the influence of changes in our advanced systems, whether resulting from changes in
32
data inputs, regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation, state street-specific or more general market, or individual financial institution-specific, activities or experiences, or other updates or factors, we expect that our advanced systems and our credit, market and operational risk exposures, our total risk-weighted assets and our capital ratios calculated under the basel iii final rule will change, and may be volatile, over time, and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period to period.
our businesses may be adversely affected by regulatory enforcement and litigation.
in the ordinary course of our business, we are subject to various regulatory, governmental and law enforcement inquiries, investigations and subpoenas. these may be directed generally to participants in the businesses or markets in which we are involved or may be specifically directed at us. in regulatory enforcement matters, claims for disgorgement, the imposition of penalties and the imposition of other remedial sanctions are possible.
from time to time, our clients, or the government on their or its own behalf, make claims and take legal action relating to, among other things, our performance of our fiduciary or contractual responsibilities. often, the announcement or other publication of such a claim or action, or of any related settlement, may spur the initiation of similar claims by other clients or governmental parties. in any such claims or actions, demands for substantial monetary damages may be asserted against us and may result in financial liability, changes in our business practices or an adverse effect on our reputation or on client demand for our products and services. the exposure associated with any proceedings that may be threatened, commenced or filed against us could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for the period in which we establish a reserve with respect to such potential liability or upon our reputation. in regulatory settlements since the financial crisis, the fines imposed by regulators have increased substantially and may exceed in some cases the profit earned or harm caused by the regulatory or other breach in december 2015, we announced a review into the manner in which we invoiced certain expenses to certain of our asset servicing clients, primarily in the united states, during an 18-year period going back to 1998. as a result of this review, we determined that we had incorrectly invoiced clients in the aggregate amount of approximately $240 million for expenses within the specific categories under review. in addition to this amount, we will compensate clients for an aggregate of approximately $17 million in interest associated with the incorrect invoicing. there is the potential that as our review continues, our estimates of the amounts reimbursable to clients may increase or that clients or regulators may assert other legal theories of liability. our billing arrangements capture multiple asset classes and transactions executed by our clients and therefore may be subject to operational error or disagreements with clients. we have notified certain governmental authorities about this review. we may become subject to regulatory proceedings and litigation in connection with this matter, and there can be no assurance as to the outcome of any proceedings that may be commenced against us.
in many cases, we are required to self-report inappropriate or non-compliant conduct to the authorities, and our failure to do so may represent an independent regulatory violation. even when we promptly bring the matter to the attention of the appropriate authorities, we may nonetheless experience regulatory fines, liabilities to clients, harm to our reputation or other adverse effects in connection with self-reported matters. moreover, our settlement or other resolution of any matter with any one or more regulators or other applicable party may not forestall other regulators or parties in the same or other jurisdictions from pursuing a claim or other action against us with respect to the same or a similar matter.
our operations are subject to regular and ongoing inspection by our bank and other financial market regulators in the u.s. and internationally. as a result of such inspections, regulators may identify areas in which we may need to take actions, which may be significant, to enhance our regulatory compliance or risk management practices. such remedial actions may entail significant cost, management attention, and systems development and such efforts may affect our ability to expand our business until such remedial actions are completed. our failure to implement enhanced compliance and risk management procedures in a manner and in a timeframe deemed to be responsive by the applicable regulatory authority could adversely impact our relationship with such regulatory authority and could lead to restrictions on our activities or other sanctions.
on june 1, 2015, we entered into a written agreement with the federal reserve and the massachusetts division of banks relating to deficiencies identified in our compliance programs with the requirements of the bank secrecy act, anti-money laundering (aml) regulations and u.s. economic sanctions regulations promulgated by ofac. as part of this enforcement action, we are required to, among other things, implement improvements to our compliance programs and to retain an independent firm to conduct a review of account and transaction activity covering a prior
33
three-month period to evaluate whether any suspicious activity not previously reported should have been identified and reported in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. if deficiencies in our historical reporting are identified as a result of the transaction review or if we fail to comply with the terms of the written agreement, we may become subject to fines and other regulatory sanctions, which may have a material adverse effect on us.
further, we may become subject to regulatory scrutiny, inquiries or investigations associated with broad, industry-wide concerns, and potentially client-related inquiries or claims, whether or not we engaged in the relevant activities, and could experience associated increased costs or harm to our reputation.
in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal and regulatory matters, we cannot provide assurance as to the outcome of any pending or potential matter or, if determined adversely against us, the costs associated with any such matter, particularly where the claimant seeks very large or indeterminate damages or where the matter presents novel legal theories, involves a large number of parties or is at a preliminary stage. we may be unable to accurately estimate our exposure to litigation risk when we record reserves for probable and estimable loss contingencies. as a result, any reserves we establish to cover any settlements, judgments or regulatory fines may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure. the resolution of certain pending or potential legal or regulatory matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for the period in which the relevant matter is resolved or an accrual is determined to be required, on our consolidated financial condition or on our reputation we face litigation and governmental and client inquiries in connection with our execution of indirect foreign exchange trades with custody clients; these issues have adversely affected our revenue from such trading and may cause our revenue from such trading to decline in the future.
our custody clients are not required to execute foreign exchange transactions with us. to the extent they execute foreign exchange trades with us, they generally execute a greater volume using our direct methods of execution at negotiated rates or spreads than they execute using our "indirect" methods at rates we establish. where our clients or their investment managers choose to use our indirect foreign exchange execution methods, generally they elect that service for trades of smaller size or for currencies where regulatory or operational requirements cause trading in such currencies to present greater operational risk and costs for them. given the nature of these trades and other features of the indirect foreign exchange trading in which we engage, we generally charge higher rates for indirect execution than we charge for other trades, including trades in the interbank currency market.
as discussed more fully below, claims have been asserted on behalf of current and former custody clients, and future claims may be asserted, alleging that our indirect foreign exchange rates (including the differences between those rates and indicative interbank market rates at the time we executed the trades) were not adequately disclosed or were otherwise improper, and seeking to recover, among other things, the full amount of the revenue we obtained from our indirect foreign exchange trading with them. in addition, attorneys general and other governmental authorities from a number of jurisdictions, as well as u.s. attorney's offices, the u.s. department of labor and the sec, have requested information or issued subpoenas in connection with inquiries into the pricing of our indirect foreign exchange trading.
in february 2011, a putative class action was filed in federal court in boston seeking unspecified damages, including treble damages, on behalf of all custodial clients that executed certain foreign exchange transactions with state street from 1998 to 2009. the putative class action alleges, among other things, that the rates at which state street executed foreign currency trades constituted an unfair and deceptive practice under massachusetts law and a breach of the duty of loyalty. two other putative class actions are currently pending in federal court in boston alleging various violations of erisa on behalf of all erisa plans custodied with us that executed indirect foreign exchange trades with state street from 1998 onward. the complaints allege that state street caused class members to pay unfair and unreasonable rates for indirect foreign exchange trades with state street. the complaints seek unspecified damages, disgorgement of profits, and other equitable relief. other claims may be asserted in the future, including in response to developments in the actions discussed above or governmental proceedings.
if these matters were to proceed to trial, we expect that plaintiffs would seek to recover their share of all or a portion of the revenue that we have recorded from indirect foreign exchange trades. we cannot predict whether a court, in the event of an adverse resolution, would consider our revenue to be the appropriate measure of damages.

the following table summarizes our estimated total revenue worldwide from indirect foreign exchange trading for the years ended december 31:
(in millions)            revenue from indirect foreign exchange trading
2008                                    $462
2009                                     369
2010                                     336
2011                                     331
2012                                     248
2013                                     285
2014                                     246
2015                                     280
we believe that the amount of our revenue from indirect foreign exchange trading had been of a similar or lesser order of magnitude for many years prior to 2008. our revenue calculations related to indirect foreign exchange trading reflect judgment concerning the relationship between the rates we charge for indirect foreign exchange execution and indicative interbank market rates near in time to execution. our revenue from foreign exchange trading generally depends on the difference between the rates we set for those indirect trades and indicative interbank market rates at the time of execution of the trade.
as of december 31, 2015, we have accrued a total of $565 million associated with our indirect foreign exchange business. this accrual reflects the current status of our ongoing efforts to seek to resolve the outstanding claims asserted in the united states against us by federal governmental entities and u.s. civil litigants with regard to our indirect foreign exchange business. although we believe this recorded legal accrual will address the financial demands associated with these claims, significant non-financial terms remain outstanding. in addition, there can be no assurance that other claims will not be asserted in the future. consequently, there can be no assurance that we will enter into any settlements, that the cost of any settlements or other resolutions of any such matters will not materially exceed our accrual or that other, potentially material, claims relating to our indirect foreign exchange business will not be asserted against us. an adverse outcome with respect to one or more claims, whether or not currently asserted, relating to our indirect foreign exchange business could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, on our consolidated results of operations for the period in which the adverse outcome occurs (or an accrual is determined to be required), or on our consolidated financial condition.
the heightened regulatory and media scrutiny on indirect foreign exchange services has resulted in clients reducing the volume of indirect foreign exchange trades, which has had and is anticipated to continue to have an adverse impact on our revenue from, and the profitability of, our indirect foreign exchange trading. some custody clients or their investment managers have elected to change the manner in which they execute foreign exchange with us or have decided not to use our foreign exchange execution methods. we do not expect the market, regulatory and other pressures on our indirect foreign exchange services to decrease in 2016. we intend to continue to offer our custody clients a range of execution options for their foreign exchange needs; however, the range of services, costs and profitability vary by execution option. we cannot provide assurance that clients or investment managers who choose to use less or none of our indirect foreign exchange trading, or to use alternatives to our existing indirect foreign exchange trading, will choose the alternatives offered by us. accordingly, our revenue earned from providing these foreign exchange trading services may decline further.
we may not be successful in implementing state street beacon, our multi-year program to create cost efficiencies through changes in our operational processes and to further digitize our processes and interfaces with our clients.
in order to maintain and grow our business, we must continuously make strategic decisions about our current and future business plans, including plans to target cost initiatives and enhance operational processes and efficiencies, plans to improve existing and to develop new service offerings and enhancements, plans for entering or exiting business lines or geographic markets, plans for acquiring or disposing of businesses, plans to build new systems, migrate from existing systems and other infrastructure and to address staffing needs. in october 2015, we announced state street beacon, a multi-year program to create cost efficiencies through changes in our operational processes and to further digitize our processes and interfaces with our clients.
operational process transformations, including state street beacon, entail significant risks. the program, and any future strategic or business plan we implement, may prove to be inadequate to achieve its objectives, may result in increased or unanticipated costs, may result in earnings volatility, may take longer than anticipated to implement, may involve elements reliant on the performance of third parties and may not be successfully implemented. in addition, our efforts to manage expenses may be matched or exceeded by our competitors. any failure to implement state street beacon in whole or in part may, among other things, reduce our competitive
35
position, diminish the cost effectiveness of our systems and processes or provide an insufficient return on our associated investment. in particular, elements of the program include investment in systems integration and new technologies, including straight-through-processing, to increase global servicing capabilities, reduce expenses and enhance the client experience, and also the development of new, and the evolution of existing, methods and tools to accelerate the pace of innovation, the introduction of new services and enhancements to the security of our data systems. the transition to new operating processes and technology infrastructure may cause disruptions in our relationships with clients and employees and may present other unanticipated technical or operational hurdles. as a result, we may not achieve some or all of the cost savings or other benefits anticipated through the program. in addition, other systems development initiatives, which are not included in state street beacon, may not have access to the same level of resources or management attention and, consequently, may be delayed or unsuccessful. many of our systems require enhancements to meet the requirements of evolving regulation, to permit us to optimize our use of capital or to reduce the risk of operating error. we may not have the resources to pursue all of these objectives, including state street beacon, simultaneously.
the success of the program and our other strategic plans could also be affected by market disruptions and unanticipated changes in the overall market for financial services and the global economy. we also may not be able to abandon or alter these plans without significant loss, as the implementation of our decisions may involve significant capital outlays, often far in advance of when we expect to generate any related revenues or cost expectations. accordingly, our business, our consolidated results of operations and our consolidated financial condition may be adversely affected by any failure or delay in our strategic decisions, including the program or elements thereof. for additional information about the program, see the "consolidated results of operations - expenses" section of management's discussion and analysis, included under item 7.
our businesses may be negatively affected by adverse publicity or other reputational harm.
our relationship with many of our clients is predicated on our reputation as a fiduciary and a service provider that adheres to the highest standards of ethics, service quality and regulatory compliance. adverse publicity, regulatory actions or fines, litigation, operational failures or the failure to meet client expectations or fiduciary or other obligations could materially and adversely affect our reputation, our ability to attract and retain clients or key employees or our sources of funding for the same or other businesses. for example, over the past several years we have experienced adverse publicity with respect to our indirect foreign exchange trading, and this adverse publicity has contributed to a shift of client volume to other foreign exchange execution methods. similarly, regulatory and reputational issues in our transition management business in the u.k. in 2010 and 2011 adversely affected our revenue from that business in subsequent years. preserving and enhancing our reputation also depends on maintaining systems, procedures and controls that address known risks and regulatory requirements, as well as our ability to timely identify, understand and mitigate additional risks that arise due to changes in our businesses and the marketplaces in which we operate, the regulatory environment and client expectations.
our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, our risk management policies and procedures may be inadequate, and operational risk could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.
we may fail to identify and manage risks related to a variety of aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, operational risk, interest-rate risk, foreign exchange risk, trading risk, fiduciary risk, legal and compliance risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. we have adopted various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risk. while we currently believe that our risk management process is effective, we cannot provide assurance that those controls, procedures, policies and systems will always be adequate to identify and manage the internal and external, including service provider, risks in our various businesses. risks that individuals, either employees or contractors, consciously circumvent established control mechanisms to, for example, exceed trading or investment management limitations, or commit fraud, are particularly challenging to manage through a control framework. the financial and reputational impact of control failures can be significant. persistent or repeated issues with respect to controls may raise concerns among regulators regarding our culture, governance and control environment. while we seek to contractually limit our financial exposure to operational risk, the degree of protection that we are able to achieve varies, and our potential exposure may be greater than the revenue we anticipate that we will earn from servicing our clients.
in addition, our businesses and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving. we may fail to identify or fully understand the implications of changes in our businesses or the financial markets and fail to adequately or timely enhance our risk framework to address those changes. if our risk
36
framework is ineffective, either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets, regulatory or industry requirements, our businesses, our counterparties, clients or service providers or for other reasons, we could incur losses, suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory or contractual mandates or expectations.
operational risk is inherent in all of our business activities. as a leading provider of services to institutional investors, we provide a broad array of services, including research, investment management, trading services and investment servicing that expose us to operational risk. in addition, these services generate a broad array of complex and specialized servicing, confidentiality and fiduciary requirements, many of which involve the opportunity for human, systems or process errors. we face the risk that the control policies, procedures and systems we have established to comply with our operational requirements will fail, will be inadequate or will become outdated. we also face the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, employee supervision or monitoring mechanisms, service-provider processes or other systems or controls, which could materially affect our future consolidated results of operations. given the volume and magnitude of transactions we process on a daily basis, operational losses represent a potentially significant financial risk for our business. operational errors that result in us remitting funds to a failing or bankrupt entity may be irreversible, and may subject us to losses.
we may also be subject to disruptions from external events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which could cause delays or disruptions to operational functions, including information processing and financial market settlement functions. in addition, our clients, vendors and counterparties could suffer from such events. should these events affect us, or the clients, vendors or counterparties with which we conduct business, our consolidated results of operations could be negatively affected. when we record balance sheet accruals for probable and estimable loss contingencies related to operational losses, we may be unable to accurately estimate our potential exposure, and any accruals we establish to cover operational losses may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.
the quantitative models we use to manage our business may contain errors that result in inadequate risk assessments, inaccurate valuations or poor business decisions, and lapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could occur, any of which could result in material harm.
we use quantitative models to help manage many different aspects of our businesses. as an input to our overall assessment of capital adequacy, we use models to measure the amount of credit risk, market risk, operational risk, interest-rate risk and liquidity risk we face. during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we sometimes use models to measure the value of asset and liability positions for which reliable market prices are not available. we also use models to support many different types of business decisions including trading activities, hedging, asset-and-liability management and whether to change business strategy. weaknesses in the underlying model, inadequate model assumptions, normal model limitations, inappropriate model use, weaknesses in model implementation or poor data quality, could result in unanticipated and adverse consequences, including material loss and material non-compliance with regulatory requirements or expectations. because of our widespread usage of models, potential weaknesses in our model risk management practices pose an ongoing risk to us.
we also may fail to accurately quantify the magnitude of the risks we face. our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions and historical analyses and correlations. these assumptions may be incorrect, and the historical correlations on which we rely may not continue to be relevant. consequently, the measurements that we make for regulatory purposes may not adequately capture or express the true risk profiles of our businesses. moreover, as businesses and markets evolve, our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution. while our risk measures may indicate sufficient capitalization, they may underestimate the level of capital necessary to conduct our businesses.
additionally, our disclosure controls and procedures may not be effective in every circumstance, and, similarly, it is possible we may identify a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting. any such lapses or deficiencies may materially and adversely affect our business and consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies, expose us to regulatory or legal proceedings, subject us to fines, penalties or judgments or harm our reputation.
37
cost shifting to non-u.s. jurisdictions and outsourcing may expose us to increased operational risk and reputational harm and may not result in expected cost savings.
we actively strive to achieve cost savings by shifting certain business processes and business support functions to lower-cost geographic locations, such as poland, india and china, and by outsourcing. we may accomplish this shift by establishing operations in lower-cost locations, by outsourcing to vendors in various jurisdictions or through joint ventures. this effort exposes us to the risk that we may not maintain service quality, control or effective management within these operations, to the risks that our outsourcing vendors or joint ventures may not comply with their servicing and other contractual obligations to us, including with respect to indemnification and information security, and to the risk that we may not satisfy applicable regulatory responsibilities regarding the management and oversight of third parties and outsourcing providers. in addition, we are exposed to the relevant macroeconomic, political and similar risks generally involved in doing business in the jurisdictions in which we establish lower-cost locations or joint ventures or in which our outsourcing vendors locate their operations. the increased elements of risk that arise from certain operating processes being conducted in some jurisdictions could lead to an increase in reputational risk. during periods of transition of operations, greater operational risk and client concern exist with respect to maintaining a high level of service delivery. the extent and pace at which we are able to move functions to lower-cost locations, joint ventures and outsourcing providers may also be affected by regulatory and client acceptance issues. such relocation or outsourcing of functions also entails costs, such as technology, real estate and restructuring expenses, that may offset or exceed the expected financial benefits of the relocation or outsourcing. in addition, the financial benefits of lower-cost locations and of outsourcings may diminish over time.
we may incur losses arising from our investments in sponsored investment funds, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations in the periods incurred.
in the normal course of business, we manage various types of sponsored investment funds through ssga. the services we provide to these sponsored investment funds generate management fee revenue, as well as servicing fees from our other businesses. from time to time, we may invest in the funds, which we refer to as seed capital, in order for the funds to establish a performance history for newly launched strategies. these funds may meet the definition of variable interest entities, as defined by gaap, and if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of these funds, we may be required to consolidate these funds in our financial statements under gaap. the funds follow specialized investment company accounting rules which prescribe fair value for the underlying investment securities held by the funds.
in the aggregate, we expect any financial losses that we realize over time from these seed investments to be limited to the actual fair value of the amount invested in the consolidated fund, which is based on the fair value of the underlying investment securities held by the funds. however, in the event of a fund wind-down, gross gains and losses of the fund may be recognized for financial accounting purposes in different periods during the time the fund is consolidated but not wholly owned. although we expect the actual economic loss to be limited to the amount invested, our losses in any period for financial accounting purposes could exceed the value of our economic interests in the fund and could exceed the value of our initial seed capital investment.
in instances where we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the sponsored investment fund, we do not include the funds in our consolidated financial statements. our risk of loss associated with investment in these unconsolidated funds primarily represents our seed capital investment, which could become realized as a result of poor investment performance. however, the amount of loss we may recognize during any period would be limited to the carrying amount of our investment.
our reputation and business prospects may be damaged if our clients incur substantial losses in investment pools in which we act as agent or are restricted in redeeming their interests in these investment pools.
we manage assets on behalf of clients in several forms, including in collective investment pools, money market funds, securities finance collateral pools, cash collateral and other cash products and short-term investment funds. our management of collective investment pools on behalf of clients exposes us to reputational risk and operational losses. if our clients incur substantial investment losses in these pools, receive redemptions as in-kind distributions rather than in cash, or experience significant under-performance relative to the market or our competitors' products, our reputation could be significantly harmed, which harm could significantly and adversely affect the prospects of our associated business units. because we often implement investment and operational decisions and actions over multiple investment pools to achieve scale, we face the risk that losses, even small losses, may have a significant effect in the aggregate.
38
within our investment management business, we manage investment pools, such as mutual funds and collective investment funds that generally offer our clients the ability to withdraw their investments on short notice, generally daily or monthly. this feature requires that we manage those pools in a manner that takes into account both maximizing the long-term return on the investment pool and retaining sufficient liquidity to meet reasonably anticipated liquidity requirements of our clients. the importance of maintaining liquidity varies by product type, but it is a particularly important feature in money market funds and other products designed to maintain a constant net asset value of $1.00.
during the market disruption that accelerated following the bankruptcy of lehman brothers, the liquidity in many asset classes, particularly short- and long-term fixed-income securities, declined dramatically, and providing liquidity to meet all client demands in these investment pools without adversely affecting the return to non-withdrawing clients became more difficult. in 2008, we imposed restrictions on cash redemptions from the agency lending collateral pools, as the per-unit market value of those funds' assets had declined below the constant $1.00 the funds employ to effect purchase and redemption transactions. both the decline of the funds' net asset value below $1.00 and the imposition of restrictions on redemptions had a significant client, reputational and regulatory impact on us, and the recurrence of such or similar circumstances in the future could adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. during this period, we also continued to process purchase and redemption of units of the collateral pools at $1.00 although the fair market value of the collateral pools' assets were less than $1.00. our willingness in the future to continue to process purchases and redemptions from collateral pools at $1.00 when the fair market value of our collateral pools' assets is less than $1.00 could expose us to significant liability. our unwillingness in the future to continue to process purchases and redemptions from collateral pools at $1.00 when the fair market value of the collateral pools' assets are less than $1.00 could similarly expose us to significant liability.
in the case of ssga funds that engage in securities lending, we implemented limitations, which were terminated in 2010, on the portion of an investor's interest in such fund that may be withdrawn during any month. we also elected to contribute significant amounts to these funds to negate the effect of the collateral pools on the funds' net asset value.
if higher than normal demands for liquidity from our clients were to return to post-lehman-brothers-bankruptcy levels or increase, managing the liquidity requirements of our collective investment pools could become more difficult. if such liquidity problems were to recur, our relationships with our clients may be adversely affected, and, we could, in certain circumstances, be required to consolidate the investment pools into our consolidated statement of condition; levels of redemption activity could increase; and our consolidated results of operations and business prospects could be adversely affected. in addition, if a money market fund that we manage were to have unexpected liquidity demands from investors in the fund that exceeded available liquidity, the fund could be required to sell assets to meet those redemption requirements, and selling the assets held by the fund at a reasonable price, if at all, may then be difficult.
while it is currently not our intention, and we do not have contractual or other obligations to do so, we have in the past guaranteed, and may in the future guarantee, liquidity to investors desiring to make withdrawals from a fund or otherwise take actions to mitigate the impact of market conditions on our clients and if permitted by applicable laws. making a significant amount of such guarantees could adversely affect our own consolidated liquidity and financial condition. because of the size of the investment pools that we manage, we may not have the financial ability or regulatory authority to support the liquidity or other demands of our clients. the extreme volatility in the equity markets has led to the potential for the return on passive and quantitative products to deviate from their target returns.
any decision by us to provide financial support to an investment pool to support our reputation in circumstances where we are not statutorily or contractually obligated to do so could result in the recognition of significant losses, could adversely affect the regulatory view of our capital levels or plans and could, in certain situations, require us to consolidate the investment pools into our consolidated statement of condition. any failure of the pools to meet redemption requests, or under-performance of our pools relative to similar products offered by our competitors, could harm our business and our reputation.
development of new products and services may impose additional costs on us and may expose us to increased operational risk.
our financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to develop and market new and innovative services and to adopt or develop new technologies that differentiate our products or provide cost efficiencies, while avoiding increased related expenses. the introduction of new products and services can entail significant time and resources, including regulatory approvals. substantial risks and
39
uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including technical and control requirements that may need to be developed and implemented, rapid technological change in the industry, our ability to access technical and other information from our clients, the significant and ongoing investments required to bring new products and services to market in a timely manner at competitive prices and the preparation of marketing, sales and other materials that fully and accurately describe the product or service and its underlying risks. our failure to manage these risks and uncertainties also exposes us to enhanced risk of operational lapses which may result in the recognition of financial statement liabilities. regulatory and internal control requirements, capital requirements, competitive alternatives, vendor relationships and shifting market preferences may also determine if such initiatives can be brought to market in a manner that is timely and attractive to our clients. failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation, as well as on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
we depend on information technology, and any failures of or damage to, attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology systems or facilities, or those of third parties with which we do business, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could result in significant limits on our ability to conduct our operations and activities, costs and reputational damage.
our businesses depend on information technology infrastructure, both internal and external, to, among other things, record and process a large volume of increasingly complex transactions and other data, in many currencies, on a daily basis, across numerous and diverse markets and jurisdictions. in recent years, several financial services firms have suffered successful cyber-attacks launched both domestically and from abroad, resulting in the disruption of services to clients, loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private data and reputational harm. we also have been subjected to cyber-attack, and although we have not to our knowledge suffered a material breach of our systems, it is possible that we could suffer such a breach in the future. cyber-threats are sophisticated and continually evolving. we may not implement effective systems and other measures to effectively prevent or mitigate the full diversity of cyber-threats or improve and adapt such systems and measures as such threats evolve and advance.
our computer, communications, data processing, networks, backup, business continuity or other operating, information or technology systems and facilities, including those that we outsource to other providers, may fail to operate properly or become disabled, overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions, provide services or maintain systems availability, maintain compliance and internal controls or otherwise appropriately conduct our business activities. for example, there could be sudden increases in transaction or data volumes, electrical or telecommunications outages, cyber-attacks or employee or contractor error or malfeasance.
the third parties with which we do business, which facilitate our business activities or with whom we otherwise engage or interact, including financial intermediaries and technology infrastructure and service providers, are also susceptible to the foregoing risks (including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely), and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be adversely affected, perhaps materially, by failures, terminations, errors or malfeasance by, or attacks or constraints on, one or more financial, technology, infrastructure or government institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business.
in particular, we, like other financial services firms, will continue to face increasing cyber threats, including computer viruses, malicious code, distributed denial of service attacks, phishing attacks, information security breaches or employee or contractor error or malfeasance that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our, our clients' or other parties' confidential, personal, proprietary or other information or otherwise disrupt, compromise or damage our or our clients' or other parties' business assets, operations and activities. our status as a global systemically important financial institution may increase the risk that we are targeted by such cyber-security threats. in addition, some of our service offerings, such as data warehousing, may also increase the risk we are, and the consequences of being, so-targeted. we therefore could experience significant related costs and exposures, including lost or constrained ability to provide our services or maintain systems availability to clients, regulatory inquiries, enforcements, actions and fines, litigation, damage to our reputation or property and enhanced competition.
due to our dependence on technology and the important role it plays in our business operations, we must persist in improving and updating our information technology infrastructure. updating these systems and facilities can require significant resources and often involves implementation,
40
integration and security risks that could cause financial, reputational and operational harm. however, failing to properly respond to and invest in changes and advancements in technology can limit our ability to attract and retain clients, prevent us from offering similar products and services as those offered by our competitors and inhibit our ability to meet regulatory requirements.
any theft, loss or other misappropriation or inadvertent disclosure of, or inappropriate access to, the confidential information we possess could have an adverse impact on our business and could subject us to regulatory actions, litigation and other adverse effects.
our businesses and relationships with clients are dependent on our ability to maintain the confidentiality of our and our clients' trade secrets and confidential information (including client transactional data and personal data about our employees, our clients and our clients' clients). unauthorized access, or failure of our controls with respect to granting access to our systems, may occur, resulting in theft, loss, or other misappropriation of such information. any theft, loss, other misappropriation or inadvertent disclosure of confidential information could have a material adverse impact on our competitive position, our relationships with our clients and our reputation and could subject us to regulatory inquiries, enforcement and fines, civil litigation and possible financial liability or costs.
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property, and we are subject to claims of third-party intellectual property rights.
our potential inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology effectively may allow competitors to duplicate our technology and products and may adversely affect our ability to compete with them. to the extent that we do not protect our intellectual property effectively through patents or other means, other parties, including former employees, with knowledge of our intellectual property may leave and seek to exploit our intellectual property for their own or others' advantage. in addition, we may infringe on claims of third-party patents, and we may face intellectual property challenges from other parties. we may not be successful in defending against any such challenges or in obtaining licenses to avoid or resolve any intellectual property disputes. third-party intellectual rights, valid or not, may also impede our deployment of the full scope of our products and service capabilities in all jurisdictions in which we operate or market our products and services. the intellectual property of an acquired business may be an important component of the value that we agree to pay for such a business. however, such acquisitions are subject to the risks that the acquired business may not own the intellectual property that we believe we are acquiring, that the intellectual property is dependent on licenses from third parties, that the acquired business infringes on the intellectual property rights of others, or that the technology does not have the acceptance in the marketplace that we anticipated.
competition for our employees is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business.
our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. competition for the best people in most activities in which we engage can be intense, and we may not be able to hire people or retain them, particularly in light of challenges associated with evolving compensation restrictions applicable, or which may become applicable, to banks and some asset managers and that potentially are not applicable to other financial services firms in all jurisdictions. the unexpected loss of services of key personnel, both in business units and control functions, could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, their knowledge of our markets, operations and clients, their years of industry experience and, in some cases, the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. similarly, the loss of key employees, either individually or as a group, could adversely affect our clients' perception of our ability to continue to manage certain types of investment management mandates or to provide other services to them.
we are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our business, which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability.
the markets in which we operate across all facets of our business are both highly competitive and global. these markets are changing as a result of new and evolving laws and regulations applicable to financial services institutions. regulatory-driven market changes cannot always be anticipated, and may adversely affect the demand for, and profitability of, the products and services that we offer. in addition, new market entrants and competitors may address changes in the markets more rapidly than we do, or may provide clients with a more attractive offering of products and services, adversely affecting our business. our efforts to develop and market new products may position us in new markets with pre-existing competitors with strong market position. we have also experienced, and anticipate that we will continue to experience, pricing pressure in many of our core businesses, particularly our custodial and

investment management services. many of our businesses compete with other domestic and international banks and financial services companies, such as custody banks, investment advisors, broker/dealers, outsourcing companies and data processing companies. further consolidation within the financial services industry could also pose challenges to us in the markets we serve, including potentially increased downward pricing pressure across our businesses.
some of our competitors, including our competitors in core services, have substantially greater capital resources than we do or are not subject to as stringent capital or other regulatory requirements as are we. in some of our businesses, we are service providers to significant competitors. these competitors are in some instances significant clients, and the retention of these clients involves additional risks, such as the avoidance of actual or perceived conflicts of interest and the maintenance of high levels of service quality and intra-company confidentiality. the ability of a competitor to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price would likely negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability. many of our core services are subject to contracts that have relatively short terms or may be terminated by our client after a short notice period. in addition, pricing pressures as a result of the activities of competitors, client pricing reviews, and rebids, as well as the introduction of new products, may result in a reduction in the prices we can charge for our products and services.
acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures pose risks for our business.
as part of our business strategy, we acquire complementary businesses and technologies, enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and divest portions of our business. we undertake transactions of varying sizes to, among other reasons, expand our geographic footprint, access new clients, technologies or services, develop closer or more collaborative relationships with our business partners, bolster existing servicing capabilities, efficiently deploy capital or leverage cost savings or other business or financial opportunities. we may not achieve the expected benefits of these transactions, which could result in increased costs, lowered revenues, ineffective deployment of capital, regulatory concerns, exit costs or diminished competitive position or reputation.
transactions of this nature also involve a number of risks and financial, accounting, tax, regulatory, managerial, operational, cultural and employment challenges, which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. for example, the businesses that we acquire or our strategic alliances or joint ventures may under-perform relative to the price paid or the resources committed by us; we may not achieve anticipated cost savings; or we may otherwise be adversely affected by acquisition-related charges. further, past acquisitions have resulted in the recognition of goodwill and other significant intangible assets in our consolidated statement of condition. these assets are not eligible for inclusion in regulatory capital under applicable requirements. in addition, we may be required to record impairment in our consolidated statement of income in future periods if we determine that the value of these assets has declined.
through our acquisitions or joint ventures, we may also assume unknown or undisclosed business, operational, tax, regulatory and other liabilities, fail to properly assess known contingent liabilities or assume businesses with internal control deficiencies. while in most of our transactions we seek to mitigate these risks through, among other things, due diligence and indemnification provisions, these or other risk-mitigating provisions we put in place may not be sufficient to address these liabilities and contingencies.
various regulatory approvals or consents, formal or informal, are generally required prior to closing of these transactions, which may include approvals or non-objections from the federal reserve and other domestic and non-u.s. regulatory authorities. these regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the completion of the acquisition or require changes to its terms that materially affect the terms of the transaction or our ability to capture some of the opportunities presented by the transaction. any such conditions, or any associated regulatory delays, could limit the benefits of the transaction. acquisitions or joint ventures we announce may not be completed if we do not receive the required regulatory approvals, if regulatory approvals are significantly delayed or if other closing conditions are not satisfied.
the integration of our acquisitions results in risks to our business and other uncertainties.
the integration of acquisitions presents risks that differ from the risks associated with our ongoing operations. integration activities are complicated and time consuming and can involve significant unforeseen costs. we may not be able to effectively assimilate services, technologies, key personnel or businesses of acquired companies into our business or service offerings as anticipated, alliances may not be successful, and we may not achieve related revenue growth or cost savings. we also face the risk of being unable to retain, or cross-sell our products or services to, the clients of acquired companies or joint ventures. acquisitions of

investment servicing businesses entail information technology systems conversions, which involve operational risks and may result in client dissatisfaction and defection. clients of investment servicing businesses that we have acquired may be competitors of our non-custody businesses. the loss of some of these clients or a significant reduction in the revenues generated from them, for competitive or other reasons, could adversely affect the benefits that we expect to achieve from these acquisitions or cause impairment to goodwill and other intangibles.
with any acquisition, the integration of the operations and resources of the businesses could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of our and the acquired company's ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures or policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients or employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. integration efforts may also divert management attention and resources.
long-term contracts expose us to pricing and performance risk.
we enter into long-term contracts to provide middle office or investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing services to clients, primarily for conversions, including services related but not limited to certain trading activities, cash reporting, settlement and reconciliation activities, collateral management and information technology development. we also may enter into longer-term arrangements with respect to custody, fund administration and depository services. these arrangements generally set forth our fee schedule for the term of the contract and, absent a change in service requirements, do not permit us to re-price the contract for changes in our costs or for market pricing. the long-term contracts for these relationships require, in some cases, considerable up-front investment by us, including technology and conversion costs, and carry the risk that pricing for the products and services we provide might not prove adequate to generate expected operating margins over the term of the contracts.
the profitability of these contracts is largely a function of our ability to accurately calculate pricing for our services, efficiently assume our contractual responsibilities in a timely manner, control our costs and maintain the relationship with the client for an adequate period of time to recover our up-front investment. our estimate of the profitability of these arrangements can be adversely affected by declines in the assets under the clients' management, whether due to general declines in the securities markets or client-specific issues. in addition, the profitability of these arrangements may be based on our ability to cross-sell additional services to these clients, and we may be unable to do so.
performance risk exists in each contract, given our dependence on successful conversion and implementation onto our own operating platforms of the service activities provided. our failure to meet specified service levels or implementation timelines may also adversely affect our revenue from such arrangements, or permit early termination of the contracts by the client. if the demand for these types of services were to decline, we could see our revenue decline.
changes in accounting standards may adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.
new accounting standards, or changes to existing accounting standards, resulting both from initiatives of the fasb, or their convergence efforts with the international accounting standards board, as well as changes in the interpretation of existing accounting standards, by the fasb or the sec or otherwise reflected in u.s. gaap, potentially could affect our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. these changes can materially affect how we record and report our consolidated results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and other financial information. in some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the revised treatment of certain transactions or activities, and, in some cases, the revision of our consolidated financial statements for prior periods.
changes in tax laws, rules or regulations, challenges to our tax positions with respect to historical transactions, and changes in the composition of our pre-tax earnings may increase our effective tax rate and thus adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.
our businesses can be directly or indirectly affected by new tax legislation, the expiration of existing tax laws or the interpretation of existing tax laws worldwide. the u.s. federal government, state governments, including massachusetts, and jurisdictions around the world continue to review proposals to amend tax laws, rules and regulations applicable to our business that could have a negative impact on our after-tax earnings.
in the normal course of our business, we are subject to review by u.s. and non-u.s. tax authorities. a review by any such authority could result in an increase in our recorded tax liability. in addition to the aforementioned risks, our effective tax rate is dependent on the nature and geographic composition of our pre-tax earnings and could be negatively affected by changes in these factors.
43
we may incur losses as a result of unforeseen events, including terrorist attacks, natural disasters, the emergence of a pandemic or acts of embezzlement.
acts of terrorism, natural disasters or the emergence of a pandemic could significantly affect our business. we have instituted disaster recovery and continuity plans to address risks from terrorism, natural disasters and pandemic; however, anticipating or addressing all potential contingencies is not possible for events of this nature. acts of terrorism, either targeted or broad in scope, or natural disasters could damage our physical facilities, harm our employees and disrupt our operations. a pandemic, or concern about a possible pandemic, could lead to operational difficulties and impair our ability to manage our business. acts of terrorism, natural disasters and pandemics could also negatively affect our clients, counterparties and service providers, as well as result in disruptions in general economic activity and the financial markets.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general as of december 31, 2015, we had consolidated total assets of $245.19 billion, consolidated total deposits of $191.63 billion, consolidated total shareholders' equity of $21.10 billion and 32,356 employees. we operate in more than 100 geographic markets worldwide, including in the u.s., canada, europe, the middle east and asia.
we have two lines of business:

investment management, through ssga, provides a broad array of investment management, investment research and investment advisory services to corporations, public funds and other sophisticated investors. ssga offers active and passive asset management strategies across equity, fixed-income and cash asset classes. products are distributed directly and through intermediaries using a variety of investment vehicles, including etfs, such as the spdr® etf brand.
for financial and other information about our lines of business, refer to "line of business information" included in this management's discussion and analysis and note 24 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
this management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k. certain previously reported amounts presented in this form 10-k have been reclassified to conform to current-year presentation.
in addition, certain prior period amounts have been revised to correct for errors related to those prior periods. refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in its application of certain accounting policies that materially affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses.
the significant accounting policies that require us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex about matters that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods include accounting for fair value measurements; other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities; impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; and contingencies. these significant accounting policies require the most subjective or complex judgments, and underlying estimates and assumptions could be subject to revision as new information becomes available. additional information about these significant accounting policies is included under "significant accounting estimates" in this management's discussion and analysis.
certain financial information provided in this form 10-k, including this management's discussion and analysis, is prepared on both a u.s. gaap, or reported basis, and a non-gaap, or operating basis, including certain non-gaap measures used in the calculation of identified regulatory capital ratios. we measure and compare certain financial information on an operating basis, as we believe that this presentation supports meaningful comparisons from period to period and the analysis of comparable financial trends with respect to our normal ongoing business operations. we believe that operating-basis financial information, which reports non-taxable revenue, such as interest revenue associated with tax-exempt investment securities, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, facilitates an investor's understanding and analysis of our underlying financial performance and trends in addition to financial information prepared and reported in conformity with u.s. gaap. we also believe that the use of certain non-gaap measures in the calculation of identified regulatory capital ratios is useful in understanding our capital position and is of interest to investors.
operating-basis financial information should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial information prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap. any non-gaap, or operating-basis, financial information presented in

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
highlights
•   in october 2015, we announced the next phase of our multi-year transformation program, which we refer to as state street beacon. we expect to deliver cost efficiencies through changes in our operational processes, and further digitize our processes and interfaces with clients. we expect state street beacon, which includes the targeted staff reductions that we announced with our third quarter 2015 results, to generate approximately $550 million in estimated annualized pre-tax expense savings over the next five years, including approximately $75 million in 2016. the full effect of the savings generated each year will be realized the following year. to implement state street beacon, we expect to incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring costs of approximately $300 million to $400 million over the five- year period ending december 31, 2020. estimated pre-tax expense savings relate only to state street beacon, include the effects of the targeted staff reductions announced as part of our third quarter of 2015 financial results, and are based on projected improvement from our full-year 2015 operating-basis expenses, all else equal. actual expenses may increase or decrease in the future due to other factors.
•   in 2015, we secured new asset servicing mandates of $797.5 billion; of that total, approximately $444.9 billion was installed prior to december 31, 2015, with the remaining balance expected to be installed in 2016 or later.
•   net outflows of aum totaled $151 billion, which does not include $13 billion of new asset management business which was awarded to ssga but not installed as of december 31, 2015.
•   during 2015, we recorded legal charges of $415 million or $0.76 per share. of that, $400 million was to increase our legal accrual associated with our indirect foreign exchange business prior to 2010. the total legal accrual associated with this matter as of the time of filing this form 10-k is $565 million. the legal accrual is further discussed under "legal and regulatory matters" in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
•   during 2015, we declared common stock dividends of $1.32 per share, totaling approximately $536 million.
•   during 2015, we purchased approximately 20.5 million shares of our common stock at an average per-share cost of $74.07 and an aggregate cost of approximately $1.52 billion. we have approximately $780 million remaining under our current $1.8 billion program approved by our board in march 2015.
additional information with respect to our common stock purchase program and stock dividends is provided under "financial condition - capital" in this management's discussion and analysis.
•   during the fourth quarter of 2015, we identified and corrected an error that originated in prior periods relating to certain expenses billed to certain of our asset servicing clients, which misstated our servicing revenue. this error misstated our servicing fee revenue. based on the results of our analysis, we determined that the error was immaterial to each of the prior reporting periods affected. however, we concluded that correcting the error in the year ended december 31, 2015 would materially misstate the consolidated results of operations for that period. accordingly, our financial results for all prior periods presented herein have been revised for the correction of this error. refer to "investment servicing" under "line of business information" within this management's discussion and analysis, and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
financial results
•   total revenue in 2015 increased 1% compared to 2014, primarily due to a 3% increase in total fee revenue, partially offset by a decline in net interest revenue.
•   total revenue in 2015 included a $165 million pre-tax gain from the sale of commercial real estate in the third-quarter of 2015 and final paydown in the fourth-quarter of a commercial real estate loan, both acquired as a result of the lehman brothers bankruptcy.
•   in 2015, we recorded a $61 million reduction to our income tax expense related to an italian deferred tax liability as a consequence of our european legal entity restructuring activities.
•   servicing fee revenue increased 1% in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to net new business, partially offset by $203 million due to the effect of the stronger u.s. dollar.
54
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
•   management fee revenue decreased 3% in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to $43 million from the effect of the stronger u.s. dollar, partially offset by net new business.
•   total expenses in 2015 increased 3% compared to 2014, primarily driven by an increase in expenses due to $415 million in legal accruals, as well as higher information systems and communications costs to support new business and other expenses from professional services, partially offset by a $108 million decrease in acquisition and restructuring costs and $251 million from the effect of the stronger u.s. dollar.
•   return on average common shareholders' equity remained flat at 9.8% in 2015 compared to 2014.
consolidated results of operations this section discusses our consolidated results of operations for 2015 compared to 2014, as well as 2014 compared to 2013, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.

fee revenue table 2: total revenue, provides the breakout of fee revenue for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
servicing and management fees collectively made up approximately 76% of our total fee revenue in 2015 compared to approximately 79% and 78%, in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the level of these fees is influenced by several factors, including the mix and volume of our assets under custody and administration and our assets under management, the value and type of securities positions held (with respect to assets under custody) and the volume of portfolio transactions, and the types of products and services used by our clients, and is generally affected by changes in worldwide equity and fixed-income security valuations and trends in market asset class preferences.
generally, servicing fees are affected by changes in daily average valuations of assets under

custody and administration. additional factors, such as the relative mix of assets serviced, the level of transaction volumes, changes in service level, the nature of services provided, balance credits, client minimum balances, pricing concessions, the geographical location in which services are provided and other factors, may have a significant effect on our servicing fee revenue.
management fees are generally affected by changes in month-end valuations of assets under management. management fees for certain components of managed assets, such as etfs, are affected by daily average valuations of assets under management. management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue, as a higher proportion of the underlying services provided, and the associated management fees earned, are dependent on equity and fixed-income security valuations. additional factors, such as the relative mix of assets managed, may have a significant effect on our management fee revenue. while certain management fees are directly determined by the values of assets under management and the investment strategies employed, management fees may reflect other factors as well, including performance fee arrangements, as well as our relationship pricing for clients using multiple services.
asset-based management fees for actively managed products are generally charged at a higher percentage of assets under management than for passive products. actively managed products may also include performance fee arrangements which are recorded when the performance period is complete. performance fees are generated when the performance of certain managed portfolios exceeds benchmarks specified in the management agreements. generally, we experience more volatility with performance fees than with more traditional management fees.
in light of the above, we estimate, using relevant information as of december 31, 2015 and assuming that all other factors remain constant, that:
•   a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, over the relevant periods for which our servicing and management fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total revenue of approximately 2%; and
•   a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide fixed income security valuations, over the relevant periods for which our servicing and management fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total revenue of approximately 1%.
see table 3: daily, month-end and year-end indices for selected equity market indices. while the specific indices presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and the performance of associated relevant indices can therefore differ from the performance of the indices presented.
daily averages and the averages of month-end indices demonstrate worldwide changes in equity markets that affect our servicing and management fee revenue. year-end indices affect the values of assets under custody and administration and assets under management as of those dates. the index names listed in the table are service marks of their respective owners.

net interest revenue see table 2: total revenue, for the breakout of interest revenue and interest expense for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
net interest revenue is defined as interest revenue earned on interest-earning assets less interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. interest-earning assets, which principally consist of investment securities, interest-bearing deposits with banks, repurchase agreements, loans and leases and other liquid assets, are financed primarily by client deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. net interest margin represents the relationship between annualized fully taxable-equivalent net interest revenue and average total interest-earning assets for the period. it is calculated by dividing fully taxable-equivalent net interest

revenue by average interest-earning assets. revenue that is exempt from income taxes, mainly that earned from certain investment securities (state and political subdivisions), is adjusted to a fully taxable-equivalent basis using a federal statutory income tax rate of 35%, adjusted for applicable state income taxes, net of the related federal tax benefit.

net interest revenue decreased 7% on a fully taxable-equivalent basis in 2015 compared to 2014. the decrease was generally the result of efforts to optimize our capital position to comply with evolving regulatory requirements on liquidity, lower yields on interest earning assets, as lower global interest rates affected our revenue from floating-rate assets and the rate at which payments from the maturity or prepayment on portfolio holdings could be reinvested, and the effect of the stronger u.s. dollar. the stronger u.s. dollar had the effect of reducing net interest revenue by approximately $54 million in 2015 compared to 2014, partially offset by the benefit of higher levels of interest-earning assets.
changes in the components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are discussed in more detail below. additional detail about the components of interest revenue and interest expense is provided in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
average total interest-earning assets were higher for 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of elevated levels of client deposits invested in interest-
bearing deposits with banks, higher average loans and leases and higher levels of cash collateral (included in other interest-earning assets in table 4: average balances and interest rates - fully taxable-equivalent basis) provided in connection with our enhanced custody business.
the higher level of investment in interest-bearing deposits with banks resulted from higher levels of client deposits and our efforts to optimize our capital position during 2015 compared to 2014, discussed further below, while the increase in average loans and leases resulted from growth in mutual fund lending and our continued investment in senior secured bank loans.
during the past year, our clients have continued to place elevated levels of deposits with us, as central bank actions have resulted in high levels of liquidity and low global interest rates. we evaluate deposits as either inherent in our relationship with our custodial clients, which we generally invest in our investment portfolio, or transient, or excess, deposits, which we generally deposit with central banks. deposits with central banks generate low returns. consequently, the elevated levels of these transient

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
deposits have contributed to a reduction of our net interest margin relative to historical levels.
the deposits with central banks are also included in our total consolidated assets, and higher deposit levels impact our regulatory leverage ratios. during the year, we took action to better balance our clients' cash management needs with our economic and regulatory objectives. these efforts contributed to a reduction of interest and non-interest bearing client deposits of $17 billion, from $209 billion as of december 31, 2014 to $192 billion as of december 31, 2015. if global interest rates increase, we would expect to see decreases in client deposits; however, in general, we continue to anticipate higher levels of client deposits, irrespective of the interest rate environment, particularly during periods of market stress.
the effect of the stronger u.s. dollar relative to other currencies, particularly the euro, also negatively impacted our net interest revenue, as we maintain a portion of our investment portfolio in euro denominated securities.  if ecb monetary policy continues to pressure european interest rates downward and the u.s. dollar remains strong or strengthens, the negative effects on our net interest revenue may continue or worsen.
we recorded aggregate discount accretion in interest revenue of $98 million in 2015 related to the assets we consolidated onto our balance sheet in 2009 from our asset-backed commercial paper conduits. subsequent to the commercial paper conduit consolidation in 2009, we have recorded total discount accretion in interest revenue as follows:

total discount accretion                          $2,122
the timing and ultimate recognition of any applicable discount accretion depends, in part, on factors that are outside of our control, including anticipated prepayment speeds and credit quality. the impact of these factors is uncertain and can be significantly influenced by general economic and financial market conditions. the timing and recognition of any applicable discount accretion can also be influenced by our ongoing management of the risks and other characteristics associated with our investment securities portfolio, including sales of securities which would otherwise generate interest revenue through accretion.
depending on the factors discussed above, among others, we anticipate that until the former conduit securities remaining in our investment portfolio mature or are sold, discount accretion will continue to contribute to our net interest revenue, though generally in declining amounts. assuming that we hold the remaining former conduit securities to maturity, all else being equal, we expect the remaining former conduit securities carried in our investment portfolio as of december 31, 2015 to generate aggregate discount accretion in future periods of approximately $209 million over their remaining terms, with approximately half of this discount accretion to be recorded over the next four years.
interest-bearing deposits with banks averaged $69.75 billion for 2015 compared to $55.35 billion for 2014. these deposits reflected our maintenance of cash balances at the federal reserve, the ecb and other non-u.s. central banks both to satisfy regulatory reserve requirements, and due to the continued elevated levels of client deposits and our investment of the excess deposits with central banks.
we expect to continue to invest deposits we deem as elevated in investment securities or short-term assets, including central bank deposits, depending on our assessment of the underlying characteristics of the deposits.
average investment securities decreased to $105.61 billion for 2015 compared to $116.81 billion for 2014, as we seek to optimize our capital position in light of the evolving regulatory environment. detail with respect to our investment securities portfolio as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 is provided in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
average loans and leases increased to $17.95 billion for 2015 compared to $15.91 billion for 2014. the increase was mainly related to mutual fund lending and our continued investment in senior secured bank loans. mutual fund lending and senior secured bank loans averaged approximately $12.73 billion for 2015, compared to $10.52 billion for 2014.

the decline in the proportion of average daily short-duration advances to average loans and leases is primarily due to growth in the other segments of the loan and lease portfolio. short-duration advances provide liquidity to clients in support of their investment activities.
average other interest-earning assets increased to $22.72 billion for 2015 from $15.94 billion for 2014. growth in our enhanced custody business, which is our principal securities financing business for our custody clients, contributed to this increase. our average other interest-earning assets, largely associated with our enhanced custody business, comprised approximately 10% of our average total interest-earning assets for 2015, compared to approximately 8% of our average total interest-earning assets for 2014. the enhanced custody business supports our overall profitability by generating securities finance revenue. the net interest earned on these transactions is generally lower than the interest earned on other alternative investments.
aggregate average interest-bearing deposits increased to $133.31 billion for 2015 from $130.30 billion for 2014. the higher levels in 2015 were primarily the result of increases in both u.s. and time deposits, offset by decreases in non-u.s. transaction accounts. future transaction account levels will be influenced by the underlying asset servicing business, client deposit behavior, as well as market conditions, including the general levels of u.s. and non-u.s. interest rates.
average other short-term borrowings declined to $3.83 billion for 2015 from $4.18 billion for 2014. the decrease was the result of state street phasing-out its commercial paper program during 2015, consistent with the objectives of its 2015 recovery and resolution plan developed pursuant to the requirements of the dodd-frank act.
average long-term debt increased to $10.33 billion for 2015 from $9.31 billion for 2014. the increase primarily reflected the issuance of $1.0 billion of senior debt issued in december 2014 and $3.0 billion of senior debt issued in august 2015
which was offset by a $900 million extendible note called at the end of february 2015 and the maturities of $500 million of senior debt in may 2014, $250 million of senior debt in march 2014 and $200 million of subordinated debt in december 2015.
average other interest-bearing liabilities decreased to $6.47 billion for 2015 from $7.35 billion for 2014, primarily the result of higher levels of cash collateral received from clients in connection with our enhanced custody business.
average loans and leases also include short-duration advances. although average short-duration advances remained relatively flat for 2015 compared to 2014, such average short-duration advances provided by us remained low relative to historical levels, primarily the result of higher levels of liquidity, including excess deposits, held by our clients.
several factors could affect future levels of our net interest revenue and margin, including the volume and mix of client liabilities; actions of various central banks; changes in u.s. and non-u.s. interest rates; changes in the various yield curves around the world; revised or proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards, or interpretations of those standards; the amount of discount accretion generated by the former conduit securities that remain in our investment securities portfolio; the yields earned on securities purchased compared to the yields earned on securities sold or matured; and changes in our enhanced custody business.
based on market conditions and other factors, we continue to reinvest the majority of the proceeds from pay-downs and maturities of investment securities in highly-rated securities, such as u.s. treasury and agency securities, municipal securities, federal agency mortgage-backed securities and u.s. and non-u.s. mortgage- and asset-backed securities. the pace at which we continue to reinvest and the types of investment securities purchased will depend on the impact of market conditions and other factors over time. we expect these factors and the levels of global interest rates to influence what effect our reinvestment program will have on future levels of our net interest revenue and net interest margin.

from time to time, in connection with the ongoing management of our investment securities portfolio, we sell available-for-sale securities to manage risk, to take advantage of favorable market conditions, to optimize our balance sheet for regulatory changes, or for other reasons. in 2015, we sold approximately $12.31 billion of such investment securities, compared to approximately $9.77 billion in 2014. we recorded $5 million of net realized losses in 2015 and $15 million of net realized gains in 2014, as presented in the preceding table.
provision for loan losses we recorded a provision for loan losses of $12 million in 2015 compared to $10 million in 2014 and $6 million in 2013. the provisions in all periods were recorded as a result of our exposure to certain senior secured bank loans to non-investment grade borrowers, which we purchased in connection with our participation in loan syndications in the non-investment-grade lending market. increases in the provisions in the year-to-date comparison reflected growth of our senior secured loan portfolio. additional information about these senior secured bank loans is provided under "financial condition - loans and leases" in this management's discussion and analysis and in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.

compensation and employee benefits expenses were flat in 2015 compared to 2014. increases in costs for additional staffing to support new business, regulatory initiatives and $72.6 million in net severance costs related to targeted staff reductions were offset by the effect of the stronger u.s. dollar and decreases in incentive compensation and benefits.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
compensation and employee benefits expenses increased 7% in 2014 compared to 2013. compensation and employee benefits expenses in 2014 included approximately $53 million of costs related to our business operations and information technology transformation program, which was completed at the end of 2014 and $84 million of net severance costs associated with staffing realignment.
information systems and communications expenses increased 5% in 2015 compared to 2014.the increase was primarily related to $31 million in additional depreciation costs supporting investments associated with regulatory initiatives and costs to support new business.
information systems and communications expenses increased 4% in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase was mainly associated with higher infrastructure costs related to the completion of our business operations and information technology transformation program.
other expenses increased 21% in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase was primarily due to legal accruals of approximately $400 million in 2015 compared to $185 million in 2014 in connection with our indirect fx client activities and higher levels of regulatory fees, which were partially offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets due to a write off of intangible assets in 2014. the legal accrual is further discussed under "legal and regulatory matters" in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
other expenses increased 23% in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to a legal accrual of $185 million in connection with management's intention to seek to resolve some, but not all, of the outstanding and potential claims arising out of our indirect fx client activities, higher levels of professional services associated with regulatory compliance requirements, a charitable contribution to the state street foundation, as well as the impact of the lehman brothers-related gains and recoveries recorded in 2013.
our compliance obligations have increased due to new regulations in the u.s. and internationally that have been adopted or proposed in response to the financial crisis. as a systemically important financial institution, we are subject to enhanced supervision and prudential standards. our status as a g-sib has also resulted in heightened prudential and conduct expectations of our u.s. and international regulators with respect to our capital and liquidity management and our compliance and risk oversight programs. these heightened expectations have increased our regulatory compliance costs, including personnel and systems, as well as significant additional implementation and related costs to enhance our regulatory compliance programs. we anticipate that these evolving and increasing regulatory compliance requirements and expectations will continue to affect our expenses. our employee compensation and benefits, information systems and other expenses could increase, as we further adjust our operations in response to new or proposed requirements and heightened expectations.
income tax expense income tax expense was $318 million for 2015 compared to $415 million for 2014. the decrease in tax expense was primarily due to deductions for litigation expense recorded in 2015. our effective tax rate for 2015 was 13.8% compared to 17.1% in 2014, and included effects of the approval of a tax refund for prior years and the reduction of $61 million for an italian deferred tax liability, partially offset by a change in new york tax law.
income tax expense was $415 million in 2014 compared to $616 million in 2013. our effective tax rate for 2014 was 17.1% compared to 23.1% in 2013. the decline in the 2014 effective tax rate was primarily attributable to an expansion of our municipal securities portfolio, increased investments in alternative energy projects and greater benefits from our non-u.s. operations.
additional information regarding income tax expense, including unrecognized tax benefits, and tax contingencies are provided in notes 22 and 13, to the consolidated financial statements under item 8 of this form 10-k.
line of business information we have two lines of business: investment servicing and investment management. the results of operations for these lines of business are not necessarily comparable with those of other companies, including companies in the financial services industry. information about our two lines of business, as well as the revenues, expenses and capital allocation methodologies associated with them, is provided in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.

(1) amounts for 2013 and 2014 reflect adjustments related to certain expenses billed to our asset servicing clients as more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
nm- not meaningful total revenue in 2015 for our investment servicing line of business, presented in table 9: investment servicing line of business results, increased 2% compared to 2014. total fee revenue increased 5% in 2015 compared to 2014.
total revenue increased 4% in 2014 compared to 2013, presented in table 9: investment servicing line of business results. total fee revenue increased 6% in 2014 compared to 2013.
net interest revenue decreased 7% in 2015 compared to 2014. the decrease was generally the result of our efforts to optimize our capital position, lower yields on interest-earning assets, as lower global interest rates affected our revenue from floating-rate assets and the effect of the stronger u.s. dollar, partially offset by the benefit of higher levels of interest-earning assets. a discussion of net interest revenue is provided under "net interest revenue" in "total revenue."
total expenses increased 5% in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase primarily resulted from expenses for a legal accrual recorded in connection with management's intention to seek to resolve some, but not all, of the outstanding and potential claims arising out of our indirect fx client activities, higher regulatory and compliance costs and increases in compensation and employee benefits due to additional staffing to support new business and regulatory initiatives. the expense increase was partially offset by the effect of the stronger u.s. dollar.
as a result of the previously disclosed review into the manner in which we invoiced certain expenses to certain asset servicing clients, we determined that we had incorrectly invoiced clients in the aggregate amount of approximately $240 million for expenses within the specific categories under review. this amount is reflected as a liability on our consolidated statement of condition as of december 31, 2015, with $223 million of this amount relating to periods prior to the 2015 fiscal year and reflected in the beginning retained earnings balance of our consolidated statement of changes in shareholders' equity as of december 31, 2014. our financial results for all prior periods presented in this form 10-k have been revised to reflect the impact of the reimbursement liability on each prior period presented. in addition to this amount, we will compensate clients for an aggregate of approximately $17 million in interest associated with the incorrect invoicing. there is the potential that as our review continues, our estimates of the amounts reimbursable to clients may increase or that clients or regulators may assert other legal theories of liability. our billing arrangements capture multiple asset classes and transactions executed by our clients and therefore may be subject to operational error or disagreements with clients. we have notified certain governmental authorities about this review. we may become subject to regulatory proceedings and litigation in connection with this matter, and there can be no assurance as to the outcome of any proceedings that may be commenced against us. refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
servicing fees servicing fees increased 1% in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to net new business (revenue added from new servicing business installed less revenue lost from the removal of assets serviced) and higher transaction volumes, partially offset by $203 million due to the effect of the stronger u.s. dollar.
servicing fees increased 6% in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of stronger global equity markets and the positive revenue impact of net new business.
servicing fees generated outside the u.s. were approximately 42% of total servicing fees for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

(1) geographic mix is based on the location in which the assets are serviced.
the decrease in total assets under custody and administration for year-end 2015 compared to year-end 2014 primarily resulted from weaker global equity markets, partially offset by net new business. asset levels as of december 31, 2015 did not reflect the estimated $352.6 billion of new business in assets to be serviced awarded to us in 2015 and prior periods but not installed prior to december 31, 2015. this new business will be reflected in assets under custody and administration in future periods after installation and will generate servicing fee revenue in subsequent periods.
with respect to these new assets, we will provide various services, including accounting, bank loan servicing, compliance reporting and monitoring, custody, depository banking services, foreign exchange, fund administration, hedge fund servicing, middle-office outsourcing, performance and analytics, private equity administration, real estate administration, securities finance, transfer agency, and wealth management services.
the value of assets under custody and administration is a broad measure of the relative size of various markets served. changes in the values of assets under custody and administration from period to period do not necessarily result in proportional changes in our servicing fee revenue.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
trading services revenue is composed of revenue generated by fx trading, as well as revenue generated by brokerage and other trading services. we primarily earn fx trading revenue by acting as a principal market-maker. we offer a range of fx products, services and execution models. most of our fx products and execution services can be grouped into three broad categories, which are further explained below: "direct sales and trading," "indirect fx trading" and "electronic fx services." with respect to electronic fx services, we provide an execution venue, but do not act as agent or principal.
we also offer a range of brokerage and other trading products tailored specifically to meet the needs of the global pension community, including transition management and commission recapture. in addition, we act as distribution agent for the spdr® gold etf. these products and services are generally differentiated by our role as an agent of the institutional investor. revenue earned from these services is recorded in other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue within brokerage and other trading services revenue.
our fx trading revenue is influenced by multiple factors, including: the volume and type of client fx transactions and related spreads; currency volatility, reflecting market conditions; and our management of exchange rate, interest rate and other market risks associated with our foreign exchange activities. the relative impact of these factors on our total fx trading revenues often differs from period to period. for example, assuming all other factors remain constant, increases or decreases in volumes or spreads across product mix tend to result in increases or decreases, as the case may be, in client-related fx revenue. revenue earned from direct sales and trading and indirect fx trading is recorded in fx trading revenue.
total fx trading revenue increased 14% in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily the result of stronger market-making revenue and higher client volumes. total fx trading revenue increased 3% in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily the result of higher client volumes.
we enter into fx transactions with clients and investment managers that contact our trading desk directly. these trades are all executed at negotiated rates. we refer to this activity, and our principal market-making activities, as "direct sales and trading" and it includes many transactions for funds serviced by third party custodians or prime brokers, as well as those funds under custody at state street. direct sales and trading revenue represented 59% of total foreign exchange trading revenue in 2015 compared to 59% and 52% in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
alternatively, clients or their investment managers may elect to route fx transactions to our fx desk through our asset-servicing operation; we refer to this activity as "indirect fx trading" and, in all cases, we are the funds' custodian. we execute indirect fx trades as a principal at rates disclosed to our clients. estimated indirect sales and trading revenue represented 41% of total foreign exchange trading revenue for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to 41% and 48% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. we calculate revenue for indirect fx trading using an attribution methodology. this methodology takes into consideration estimated mark-ups/downs and observed client volumes. direct sales and trading revenue is all other fx trading revenue other than the revenue attributed to indirect fx trading.
our clients that utilize indirect fx trading can, in addition to executing their fx transactions through dealers not affiliated with us, transition from indirect fx trading to either direct sales and trading execution, including our "street fx" service, or to one of our electronic trading platforms. street fx, in which we continue to act as a principal market-maker, enables our clients to define their fx execution strategy and automate the fx trade execution process, both for funds under custody with us as well as those under custody at another bank.
our direct sales and trading revenue increased 14% in 2015 as compared to 2014. the increase primarily resulted from higher market-making activities and client volumes. our estimated indirect fx trading revenue increased 14% in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase mainly resulted from higher spreads.
our direct sales and trading revenue increased 19% in 2014 as compared to 2013. the increase primarily resulted from higher client volumes, partially offset by lower currency volatility and spreads. our estimated indirect fx trading revenue decreased 14% in 2014 compared to 2013. the decline mainly resulted from lower client volumes and spreads.
we continue to expect that some clients may choose, over time, to reduce their level of indirect fx trading transactions in favor of other execution methods, including either direct sales and trading transactions or electronic fx services which we provide. to the extent that clients shift to other execution methods that we provide, our fx trading revenue may decrease, even if volumes remain consistent.
total brokerage and other trading services revenue decreased 3% in 2015 compared to 2014, and decreased 1% in 2014 compared to 2013. decreases in both periods were primarily due a decline in volumes and lower transition management revenue.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
our clients may choose to execute fx transactions through one of our electronic trading platforms. these transactions generate revenue through a "click" fee. revenue from such electronic fx services decreased 3% in 2015 compared to 2014 and decreased 17% in 2014 compared to 2013, mainly due to declines in client volumes.
other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue decreased 3% in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a decrease in transition management revenue, partially offset by an increase in other trading revenue.
other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue increased 14% in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to an increase in currency management revenue.
in recent years, our transition management revenue was adversely affected by compliance issues in our u.k. business during 2010 and 2011. the reputational and regulatory impact of those compliance issues may adversely affect our transition management revenue in future periods.
securities finance our securities finance business consists of three components: (1) an agency lending program for ssga-managed investment funds with a broad range of investment objectives, which we refer to as the ssga lending funds, (2) an agency lending program for third-party investment managers and asset owners, which we refer to as the agency lending funds and (3) security lending transactions which we enter into as principal, which we refer to as our enhanced custody business.
see table 9: investment servicing line of business results for the comparison of securities finance revenue for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
securities finance revenue earned from our agency lending activities, which is composed of our split of both the spreads related to cash collateral and the fees related to non-cash collateral, is principally a function of the volume of securities on loan, the interest-rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral, and our share of the fee split.
as principal, our enhanced custody business borrows securities from the lending client and then lends such securities to the subsequent borrower, either a state street client or a broker/dealer. we act as principal when the lending client is unable to, or elects not to, transact directly with the market and execute the transaction and furnish the securities. in our role as principal, we provide support to the transaction through our credit rating. while we source a significant proportion of the securities furnished by us in our role as principal from third parties, we have the ability to source securities through our assets under custody and administration from clients who have designated state street as an eligible borrower.
securities finance revenue increased 14% in 2015 compared to 2014. the increase was primarily the result of growth in our enhanced custody business.
securities finance revenue increased 22% in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase was mainly the result of growth in our enhanced custody business and the impact of higher lending volumes associated with our agency lending program.
market influences may continue to affect client demand for securities finance, and as a result our revenue from, and the profitability of, our securities lending activities in future periods. in addition, the constantly evolving regulatory environment may affect the volume of our securities lending activity and related revenue and profitability in future periods.
processing fees and other processing fees and other revenue includes diverse types of fees and revenue, including fees from our structured products business, fees from software licensing and maintenance, equity income from our joint venture investments, gains and losses on sales of leased equipment and other assets, and amortization of our tax-advantaged investments.
processing fees and other revenue increased 82% in 2015 compared to 2014, as presented in table 9: investment servicing line of business results. the increase was primarily due to a gain from the sale of commercial real estate in the third-quarter of 2015 and final paydown in the fourth-quarter of 2015 of a commercial real estate loan, both acquired as a result of the lehman brothers bankruptcy.
processing fees and other revenue declined 13% in 2014 compared to 2013 as presented in table 9: investment servicing line of business results. the decrease was mainly due to higher amortization of tax-advantaged investments, partially offset by higher revenue from our investment in bank-owned life insurance.

nm not meaningful total revenue for our investment management line of business, presented in table 14: investment management line of business results, decreased 5% in 2015 compared to 2014. total fee revenue decreased 4% compared to 2014.
total revenue increased 5% and total fee revenue increased 6% in 2014 compared to 2013.
total expenses were flat in 2015 compared to 2014 resulting from higher transaction processing services and increases in regulatory and compliance costs, offset by recoveries associated with lehman brothers-related assets recorded in 2015 and the effect of the stronger u.s. dollar.
management fees through ssga, we provide a broad range of investment management strategies, specialized investment management advisory services and other financial services for corporations, public funds, and other sophisticated investors. ssga offers an array of investment management strategies, including passive and active, such as enhanced indexing, using quantitative and fundamental methods for both u.s. and global equity and fixed income securities. ssga also offers etfs, such as the spdr® etf brand. while certain management fees are directly determined by the values of assets under management and the investment strategies employed, management fees reflect other factors as well, including our relationship pricing for clients who use multiple services, and the benchmarks specified in the respective management agreements related to performance fees.
management fees decreased $33 million, or 3%, in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a $43 million effect of the stronger u.s. dollar, offset by net new business.
management fees increased 9% in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of stronger global equity markets, net inflows and the positive revenue impact of the excess of revenue added from newly installed assets to be managed over the revenue lost from liquidations of managed assets.
management fees generated outside the u.s. were approximately 35% of total management fees for 2015, compared to 37% in 2014 and 2013.

the decrease in total aum in 2015 compared to 2014 resulted from net outflows of approximately $151 billion. net outflows were driven by approximately $100 billion from long-term institutional portfolios attributable to institutional equity product asset allocation shifts, approximately $27 billion from cash products and approximately $24 billion from etfs which include spy, our s&p 500 etf. net outflows include an expected redemption by one sub-advisory client that is in-sourcing their business. further redemptions by this client, totaling approximately $35 billion, are expected to continue through the remainder of 2016 and are not expected to have a significant impact on revenue.
aum did not include approximately $13 billion of new asset management business, which was awarded to ssga but not installed as of december 31, 2015. this new business will be reflected in assets under management in future periods after installation, and will generate management fee revenue in subsequent periods.
total assets under management as of december 31, 2015 included managed assets lost but not yet liquidated. lost business occurs from time to time and it is difficult to predict the timing of client behavior in transitioning these assets. this timing can vary significantly.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
financial condition the structure of our consolidated statement of condition is primarily driven by the liabilities generated by our investment servicing and investment management lines of business. our clients' needs and our operating objectives determine balance sheet volume, mix, and currency denomination. as our clients execute their worldwide cash management and investment activities, they utilize deposits and short-term investments that constitute the majority of our liabilities. these liabilities are generally in the form of interest-bearing transaction account deposits, which are denominated in a variety of currencies; non-interest-bearing demand deposits; and repurchase agreements, which generally serve as short-term investment alternatives for our clients.
deposits and other liabilities resulting from client initiated transactions are invested in assets that generally have contractual maturities significantly longer than our liabilities; however, we evaluate the operational nature of our deposits and seek to maintain appropriate short-term liquidity of those liabilities that are not operational in nature and maintain longer-termed assets for our operational deposits. our assets consist primarily of securities held in our available-for-sale or held-to-maturity portfolios and short-duration financial instruments, such as interest-bearing deposits with banks and securities purchased under resale agreements. the actual mix of assets is determined by the characteristics of the client liabilities and our desire to maintain a well-diversified portfolio of high-quality assets.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
in december 2013, u.s. regulators issued final regulations to implement the volcker rule. the volcker rule will, over time, prohibit banking entities, including us and our affiliates, from engaging in certain prohibited proprietary trading activities, as defined in the final volcker rule regulations, subject to exemptions for market making-related activities, risk-mitigating hedging, underwriting and certain other activities. the volcker rule will also require banking entities to either restructure or divest certain ownership interests in, and relationships with, covered funds (as such terms are defined in the final volcker rule regulations).
whether certain types of investment securities or structures, such as clos, constitute covered funds, as defined in the final volcker rule regulations, and do not benefit from the exemptions provided in the volcker rule, and whether a banking organization's investments therein constitute ownership interests remain subject to (1) market, and ultimately regulatory, interpretation, and (2) the specific terms and other characteristics relevant to such investment securities and structures.
refer to the "supervision and regulation" section, included under item 1 of this form 10-k for information regarding the volcker rule and related regulations.
as of december 31, 2015, we held approximately $2.10 billion of investments in clos. as of the same date, these investments had an aggregate pre-tax net unrealized gain of approximately $43 million, composed of gross unrealized gains of $46 million and gross unrealized losses of $3 million. comparatively, as of december 31, 2014, we held approximately $4.54 billion of investments in clos which had an aggregate pre-tax net unrealized gain of approximately $97 million, composed of gross unrealized gains of $105 million and gross unrealized losses of $8 million. in the event that we or our banking regulators conclude that such investments in clos, or other investments, are covered funds under the volker rule, we may be required to divest of such investments. if other banking entities reach similar conclusions with respect to similar investments held by them, the prices of such investments could decline significantly, and we may be required to divest of such investments at a significant discount compared to the investments' book value. this could result in a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or on our consolidated financial condition in the period in which such a divestiture occurs.
non-u.s. debt securities approximately 23% of the aggregate carrying value of our investment securities portfolio has non-u.s. debt securities as of december 31, 2015 compared to approximately 26% as of december 31, 2014.

(1) the maturities of mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are based on expected principal payments.
(2) yields were calculated on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, using applicable federal and state income tax rates.
impairment impairment exists when the fair value of an individual security is below its amortized cost basis. impairment of a security is further assessed to determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. when the impairment is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we record the loss in our consolidated statement of income. in addition, for afs and htm debt securities, we record impairment in our consolidated statement of income when management intends to sell (or may be required to sell) the securities before they recover in value, or when management expects the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the securities to be less than the amortized cost of the impaired security (a credit loss).

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
the decrease in the net unrealized gain position as of december 31, 2015 as compared to december 31, 2014, presented in table 25: amortized cost, fair value and net unrealized gains (losses) of investment securities, was primarily attributable to the decrease in the balance of our afs portfolio and widening spreads.

(1) afs securities are carried at fair value, with after-tax net unrealized gains and losses recorded in aoci. htm securities are carried at cost, and unrealized gains and losses are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements.
we conduct periodic reviews of individual securities to assess whether otti exists. our assessment of otti involves an evaluation of economic and security-specific factors. such factors are based on estimates, derived by management, which contemplate current market conditions and security-specific performance. to the extent that market conditions are worse than management's expectations, otti could increase, in particular the credit-related component that would be recorded in our consolidated statement of income.
in the aggregate, we recorded net losses from otti of $1 million and $11 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. management considers the aggregate decline in fair value of the remaining investment securities and the resulting gross unrealized losses of $841 million as of december 31, 2015 to be temporary and not the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the securities. additional information with respect to otti, net impairment losses and gross unrealized losses is provided in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
our evaluation of potential otti of mortgage-backed securities with collateral in spain, italy, ireland, and portugal takes into account slow economic growth, austerity measures, and government intervention in the corresponding mortgage markets and assumes a conservative baseline macroeconomic environment. our baseline view assumes a recessionary period characterized by high unemployment and by additional declines in housing prices between 3% and 17%. our evaluation of otti in our base case does not assume a disorderly sovereign debt restructuring or a break-up of the eurozone.
excluding otti recorded in 2015, management considers the aggregate decline in fair value of the remaining investment securities and the resulting gross unrealized losses as of december 31, 2015 to be temporary and not the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the securities. additional information about these gross unrealized losses is provided in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.

the increase in loans in the institutional segment as of december 31, 2015 as compared to december 31, 2014 was primarily driven by increased investment in the non-investment-grade lending market through participations in loan syndications, specifically senior secured bank loans, partially offset by lower levels of short-duration advances.
short-duration advances to our clients included in the institutional segment were $2.62 billion and $3.54 billion as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively. these short-duration advances provide liquidity to fund clients in

support of their transaction flows associated with securities settlement activities.
as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, our investment in senior secured bank loans totaled approximately $3.14 billion and $2.07 billion, respectively. in addition, we had binding unfunded commitments as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 of $186 million and $337 million, respectively, to participate in such syndications.
these senior secured bank loans, which we have rated "speculative" under our internal risk-rating framework (refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k), are externally rated "bbb," "bb" or "b," with approximately 93% of the loans rated "bb" or "b" as of december 31, 2015, compared to 95% as of december 31, 2014. our investment strategy involves limiting our investment to larger, more liquid credits underwritten by major global financial institutions, applying our internal credit analysis process to each potential investment, and diversifying our exposure by counterparty and industry segment. however, these loans have significant exposure to credit losses relative to higher-rated loans. as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, our allowance for loan losses included approximately $35 million and $26 million, respectively, related to these senior secured bank loans. as this portfolio grows and becomes more seasoned, our allowance for loan losses related to these loans may increase through additional provisions for credit losses.
as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, unearned income deducted from our investment in leveraged lease financing was $102 million and $109 million, respectively, for u.s. leases and $231 million and $261 million, respectively, for non-u.s. leases.
the cre loans are composed of the loans acquired in 2008 pursuant to indemnified repurchase agreements with an affiliate of lehman as a result of the lehman brothers bankruptcy. additional information about all of our loan-and-lease segments, as well as underlying classes, is provided in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
no loans, including cre loans, were modified in troubled debt restructurings in 2015 or in 2014.

the provision of $12 million and the charge-offs of $4 million recorded in 2015 were associated with our exposure to certain senior secured bank loans to non-investment grade borrowers, which we purchased in connection with our participation in loan syndications in the non-investment-grade lending market.
as of december 31, 2015, approximately $35 million of our allowance for loan losses was related to senior secured bank loans included in the institutional segment; the remaining $11 million was related to other commercial and financial loans in the institutional segment.
cross-border outstandings cross-border outstandings are amounts payable to us by non-u.s. counterparties which are denominated in u.s. dollars or other non-local currency, as well as non-u.s. local currency claims not funded by local currency liabilities. our cross-border outstandings consist primarily of deposits with banks; loans and lease financing, including short-duration advances; investment securities; amounts related to foreign exchange and interest-rate contracts; and securities finance.  in addition to credit risk, cross-border outstandings have the risk that, as a result of political or economic conditions in a country, borrowers may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations of principal and/or interest when due because of the unavailability of, or restrictions on, foreign exchange needed by borrowers to repay their obligations.
we place deposits with non-u.s. counterparties that have strong internal state street risk ratings. counterparties are approved and monitored by our country risk committee. this process includes financial analysis of non-u.s. counterparties and the use of an internal risk-rating system. each counterparty is reviewed at least annually and potentially more frequently based on deteriorating credit fundamentals or general market conditions. we also utilize risk mitigation and other facilities that may reduce our exposure through the use of cash collateral and/or balance sheet netting where we deem appropriate. in addition, the country risk committee performs country-risk analyses and monitors limits on country exposure.
the total cross-border outstandings presented in table 30: cross-border outstandings represented approximately 25%, 17% and 19% of our consolidated total assets as of december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

throughout the sovereign debt crisis, the major independent credit rating agencies have downgraded u.s. and non-u.s. financial institutions and sovereign issuers which have been, and may in the future be, significant counterparties to us, or whose financial instruments serve as collateral on which we rely for credit risk mitigation purposes, and may do so again in the future. as a result, we may be exposed to increased counterparty risk, leading to negative ratings volatility.
risk management general in the normal course of our global business activities, we are exposed to a variety of risks, some inherent in the financial services industry, others more specific to our business activities. our risk management framework focuses on material risks, which include the following:
•   credit and counterparty risk;
•   liquidity risk, funding and management;
•   operational risk;
•   information technology risk;
•   market risk associated with our trading activities;
•   market risk associated with our non-trading activities, which we refer to as asset-and-liability management, and which consists primarily of interest-rate risk;
•   strategic risk;
•   model risk; and
•   reputational, fiduciary and business conduct risk.
many of these risks, as well as certain of the factors underlying each of these risks that could affect our businesses and our consolidated financial statements, are discussed in detail under item 1a, "risk factors," included in this form 10-k.
the scope of our business requires that we balance these risks with a comprehensive and well-integrated risk management function. the identification, assessment, monitoring, mitigation and reporting of risks are essential to our financial performance and successful management of our businesses. these risks, if not effectively managed, can result in losses to state street as well as erosion of our capital and damage to our reputation. our approach, including board and senior management oversight and a system of policies, procedures, limits, risk measurement and monitoring and internal controls, allows for an assessment of risks within a framework for evaluating opportunities for the prudent use of capital that appropriately balances risk and return.
our objective is to optimize our return while operating at a prudent level of risk. in support of this objective, we have instituted a risk appetite framework that aligns our business strategy and financial objectives with the level of risk that we are willing to incur.
our risk management is based on the following major goals:
▪   a culture of risk awareness that extends across all of our business activities;
▪   the identification, classification and quantification of state street's material risks;
▪   the establishment of our risk appetite and associated limits and policies, and our compliance with these limits;
▪   the establishment of a risk management structure at the "top of the house" that enables the control and coordination of risk-taking across the business lines;
▪   the implementation of stress testing practices and a dynamic risk-assessment capability;
77
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
▪   a direct link between risk and strategic-decision making processes and incentive compensation practices; and
▪   the overall flexibility to adapt to the ever-changing business and market conditions.
our risk appetite framework outlines the quantitative limits and qualitative goals that define our risk appetite, as well as the responsibilities for measuring and monitoring risk against limits, and for reporting, escalating, approving and addressing exceptions. our risk appetite framework is established by erm, a corporate risk oversight group, in conjunction with the mrac and the rc of the board. the board formally reviews and approves our risk appetite statement annually, or more frequently as required.
the risk appetite framework describes the level and types of risk that we are willing to accommodate in executing our business strategy, and also serves as a guide in setting risk limits across our business units. in addition to our risk appetite framework, we use stress testing as another important tool in our risk management practice. additional information with respect to our stress testing process and practices is provided under "capital" in management's discussion and analysis.

governance and structure we have an approach to risk management that involves all levels of management, from the board and its committees, including its e&a committee, rc, the ecc, as well as the technology committee, to each business unit and each employee. we allocate responsibility for risk oversight so that risk/return decisions are made at an appropriate level, and are subject to robust and effective review and challenge. risk management is the responsibility of each employee, and is implemented through three lines of defense: the business units, which own and manage the risks inherent in their business, are considered the first line of defense; erm and other support functions, such as compliance, finance and vendor management, provide the second line of defense; and corporate audit, which assesses the effectiveness of the first two lines of defense.
the responsibilities for effective review and challenge reside with senior managers, management oversight committees, corporate audit and, ultimately, the board and its committees. while we believe that our risk management program is effective in managing the risks in our businesses, internal and external factors may create risks that cannot always be identified or anticipated.
corporate-level risk committees provide focused oversight, and establish corporate standards and policies for specific risks, including credit, sovereign exposure, market, liquidity, operational, information technology as well as new business products, regulatory compliance and ethics, vendor risk and model risks. these committees have been delegated the responsibility to develop recommendations and remediation strategies to address issues that affect or have the potential to affect state street.
we maintain a risk governance committee structure which serves as the formal governance mechanism through which we seek to undertake the consistent identification, management and mitigation of various risks facing state street in connection with its business activities. this governance structure is enhanced and integrated through multi-disciplinary involvement, particularly through erm. the following chart presents this structure.

the cro is responsible for state street's risk management globally, leads erm and has a dual reporting line to state street's ceo and the board's rc. erm manages its responsibilities globally through a three-dimensional organization structure:
•   "vertical" business unit-aligned risk groups that support business managers with risk management, measurement and monitoring activities;
•   "horizontal" risk groups that monitor the risks that cross all of our business units (for example, credit and operational risk); and
•   risk oversight for international activities, which combines intersecting "verticals" and "horizontals" through a hub and spoke model to provide important regional and legal entity perspectives to the global risk framework.
sitting on top of this three-dimensional organization structure is a centralized group responsible for the aggregation of risk exposures across the vertical, horizontal and regional dimensions, for consolidated reporting, for setting the corporate-level risk appetite framework and associated limits and policies, and for dynamic risk assessment across state street.

the technology committee leads and assists in the board's oversight of the role of technology in executing state street's strategy and supporting state street's global business and operational requirements. the technology committee reviews the use of technology in our activities and operations, as well as significant technology and technology-
related strategies, investments and policies. in addition, the technology committee reviews and approves technology and technology-related risk matters, including information and cyber security.
executive management committees mrac is the senior management decision-making body for risk and capital issues, and oversees our financial risks, our consolidated statement of condition, and our capital adequacy, liquidity and recovery and resolution planning. its responsibilities include:
•   the approval of the policies of our global risk, capital and liquidity management frameworks, including our risk appetite framework;

•   the oversight of our firm-wide risk identification, model risk governance, stress testing and recovery and resolution plan programs; and
•   the ongoing monitoring and review of risks undertaken within the businesses, and our senior management oversight and approval of risk strategies and tactics.
mrac, which is co-chaired by our cro and the cfo, regularly presents a report to the rc outlining developments in the risk environment and performance trends in our key business areas.
bcrc provides additional risk governance and leadership, by overseeing our business practices in terms of our compliance with laws, regulations and our standards of business conduct, our commitments to clients and others with whom we do business, and potential reputational risks. management considers adherence to high ethical standards to be critical to the success of our business and to our reputation. the bcrc is co-chaired by our cro and our chief legal officer.
torc oversees and assesses the effectiveness of corporate-wide technology and operational risk management programs, to manage and control technology and operational risk consistently across the organization. torc is co-chaired by our cro and our vice chairman & head of the office of regulatory initiatives.

credit risk management core policies and principles we define credit risk as the risk of financial loss if a counterparty, borrower or obligor, collectively referred to as counterparty, is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or settle a transaction in accordance with underlying contractual terms. we assume credit risk in our traditional non-trading lending activities, such as loans and contingent commitments, in our investment securities portfolio, where recourse to a counterparty exists, and in our direct and indirect trading activities, such as principal securities lending and foreign exchange and indemnified agency securities lending. we also assume credit risk in our day-to-day treasury and securities and other settlement operations, in the form of deposit placements and other cash balances, with central banks or private sector institutions.
we distinguish between three major types of credit risk:
▪   default risk - the risk that a counterparty fails to meet its contractual payment obligations;
▪   country risk - the risk that we may suffer a loss, in any given country, due to any of the following reasons: deterioration of economic conditions, political and social upheaval, nationalization and appropriation of assets, government repudiation of indebtedness, exchange controls, and disruptive currency depreciation or devaluation; and
▪   settlement risk - the risk that the settlement or clearance of transactions will fail, which arises whenever the exchange of cash, securities and/or other assets is not simultaneous.
the acceptance of credit risk by state street is governed by corporate policies and guidelines, which include standardized procedures applied across the entire organization. these policies and guidelines include specific requirements related to each counterparty's risk profile; the markets served; counterparty, industry and country concentrations; and regulatory compliance. these policies and procedures also implement a number of core principles, which include the following:
•   we measure and consolidate credit risks to each counterparty, or group of counterparties, in accordance with a "one-obligor" principle that aggregates risks across our business units;
•   erm reviews and approves all extensions of credit, or material changes to extensions of credit (such as changes in term, collateral structure or covenants), in accordance with assigned credit-approval authorities;
•   credit-approval authorities are assigned to individuals according to their qualifications, experience and training, and these authorities are periodically reviewed. our largest exposures require approval by the credit committee, a sub-committee of the crpc. with respect to small and low-risk extensions of credit to certain types of counterparties, approval authority is granted to individuals outside of erm;

are subject to frequent review and approval in accordance with our risk appetite;
•   we determine the creditworthiness of counterparties through a detailed risk assessment, including the use of comprehensive internal risk-rating methodologies;
•   we review all extensions of credit and the creditworthiness of counterparties at least annually. the nature and extent of these reviews are determined by the size, nature and term of the extensions of credit and the creditworthiness of the counterparty; and
•   we subject all corporate policies and guidelines to annual review as an integral part of our periodic assessment of our risk appetite.
our corporate policies and guidelines require that the business units which engage in activities that give rise to credit and counterparty risk comply with procedures that promote the extension of credit for legitimate business purposes; are consistent with the maintenance of proper credit standards; limit credit-related losses; and are consistent with our goal of maintaining a strong financial condition.
structure and organization the credit risk group within erm is responsible for the assessment, approval and monitoring of credit risk across state street. the group is managed centrally, has dedicated teams in a number of locations worldwide across our businesses, and is responsible for related policies and procedures, and for our internal credit-rating systems and methodologies. in addition, the group, in conjunction with the business units, establishes appropriate measurements and limits to control the amount of credit risk accepted across its various business activities, both at the portfolio level and for each individual counterparty or group of counterparties, to individual industries, and also to counterparties by product and country of risk. these measurements and limits are reviewed periodically, but at least annually.
in conjunction with other groups in erm, the credit risk group is jointly responsible for the design, implementation and oversight of our credit risk measurement and management systems, including data and assessment systems, quantification systems and the reporting framework.
various key committees within state street are responsible for the oversight of credit risk and associated credit risk policies, systems and models. all credit-related activities are governed by our risk appetite framework and our credit risk guidelines, which define our general philosophy with respect to credit risk and the manner in which we control, manage and monitor such risks.
the previously described crpc (refer to "risk committees") has primary responsibility for the oversight, review and approval of the credit risk guidelines and policies. credit risk guidelines and policies are reviewed periodically, but at least annually.
the credit committee, a sub-committee of the crpc, has responsibility for assigning credit authority and approving the largest and higher-risk extensions of credit to individual counterparties or groups of counterparties.
crpc provides periodic updates to mrac and the board's rc.
credit ratings we perform initial and ongoing reviews to exercise due diligence on the creditworthiness of our counterparties when conducting any business with them or approving any credit limits.
this due diligence process generally includes the assignment of an internal credit rating, which is determined by the use of internally developed and validated methodologies, scorecards and a 15-grade rating scale. this risk-rating process incorporates the use of risk-rating tools in conjunction with management judgment; qualitative and quantitative inputs are captured in a replicable manner and, following a formal review and approval process, an internal credit rating based on our rating scale is assigned. credit ratings are reviewed and approved by the credit risk group or designees within erm. to facilitate comparability across the portfolio, counterparties within a given sector are rated using a risk-rating tool developed for that sector.
our risk-rating methodologies are approved by the crpc, after completion of internal model validation processes, and are subject to an annual review, including re-validation.
we generally rate our counterparties individually, although certain portfolios defined by us as low-risk are rated on a pooled basis. we evaluate and rate the credit risk of our counterparties on an ongoing basis.
risk parameter estimates our internal risk-rating system promotes a clear and consistent approach to the determination of appropriate credit risk classifications for our credit counterparties and exposures, tracking the changes in risk associated with these counterparties and exposures over time. this capability enhances our ability to more accurately calculate both risk exposures and capital, enabling better strategic decision making across the organization.
83
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
we use credit risk parameter estimates for the following purposes:
•   the assessment of the creditworthiness of new counterparties and, in conjunction with our risk appetite statement, the development of appropriate credit limits for our products and services, including loans, foreign exchange, securities finance, placements and repurchase agreements;
•   the use of an automated process for limit approvals for certain low-risk counterparties, as defined in our credit risk guidelines, based on the counterparty's probability-of-default, or pd, rating class;
•   the development of approval authority matrices based on pd; riskier counterparties with higher ratings require higher levels of approval for a comparable pd and limit size compared to less risky counterparties with lower ratings;
•   the analysis of risk concentration trends using historical pd and exposure-at-default, or ead, data;
•   the standardization of rating integrity testing by gcr using rating parameters;
•   the determination of the level of management review of short-duration advances depending on pd; riskier counterparties with higher rating class values generally trigger higher levels of management escalation for comparable short-duration advances compared to less risky counterparties with lower rating-class values;
•   the monitoring of credit facility utilization levels using ead values and the identification of instances where counterparties have exceeded limits;
•   the aggregation and comparison of counterparty exposures with risk appetite levels to determine if businesses are maintaining appropriate risk levels; and
•   the determination of our regulatory capital requirements for the airb provided in the basel framework.
credit risk mitigation we seek to limit our credit exposure and reduce our potential credit losses through various types of risk mitigation. in our day-to-day management of credit risks, we utilize and recognize the following types of risk mitigation.
•   collateral. in many parts of our business, we regularly require or agree for collateral to be received from or provided to clients and counterparties in connection with contracts that incur credit risk. in our trading businesses, this collateral is typically in the form of cash and high-grade securities (government securities and other bonds or equity securities). credit risks in our non-trading and securities finance businesses are also often secured by bonds and equity securities and by other types of assets. collateral serves to reduce the risk of loss inherent in an exposure by improving the prospect of recovery in the event of a counterparty default. while collateral is often an alternative source of repayment, it generally does not replace the requirement within our policies and guidelines for high-quality underwriting standards.
our credit risk guidelines require that the collateral we accept for risk mitigation purposes is of high quality, can be reliably valued and can be liquidated if or when required. generally, when collateral is of lower quality, more difficult to value or more challenging to liquidate, higher discounts to market values are applied for the purposes of measuring credit risk. for certain less liquid collateral, longer liquidation periods are assumed when determining the credit exposure.
all types of collateral are assessed regularly by erm, as is the basis on which the collateral is valued. our assessment of collateral, including the ability to liquidate collateral in the event of a counterparty default, and also with regard to market values of collateral under a variety of hypothetical market conditions, is an integral component of our assessment of risk and approval of credit limits. we also seek to identify, limit and monitor instances of "wrong-way" risk, where a counterparty's risk of default is positively correlated with the risk of our collateral eroding in value.
we maintain policies and procedures requiring that documentation used to collateralize a transaction is legal, valid, binding and enforceable in the relevant jurisdictions. we also conduct legal reviews to assess whether our documentation meets these standards on an ongoing basis.
•   netting. netting is a mechanism that allows institutions and counterparties to net offsetting exposures and payment obligations against one another through the use of qualifying master netting agreements. a master netting agreement allows the netting of rights and obligations arising under derivative or other transactions that
84
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
have been entered into under such an agreement upon the counterparty's default, resulting in a single net claim owed by, or to, the counterparty. this is commonly referred to as "close-out netting," and is pursued wherever possible. we may also enter into master agreements that allow for the netting of amounts payable on a given day and in the same currency, reducing our settlement risk. this is commonly referred to as "payment netting," and is widely used in our foreign exchange activities.
as with collateral, we have policies and procedures in place to apply close-out and payment netting only to the extent that we have verified legal validity and enforceability of the master agreement. in the case of payment netting, operational constraints with our counterparties may preclude us from reducing settlement risk, notwithstanding the legal right to require the same under the master netting agreement.
•   guarantees. a guarantee is a financial instrument that results in credit support being provided by a third party, (i.e., the protection provider) to the underlying obligor (the beneficiary of the provided protection) on account of an exposure owing by the obligor. the protection provider may support the underlying exposure either in whole or in part. support of this kind may take different forms. typical forms of guarantees provided to state street include financial guarantees, letters of credit, bankers' acceptances, pua contracts and insurance.
erm and legal teams have established a review process to evaluate guarantees under the applicable requirements of state street policies and basel iii requirements. governance for this evaluation is covered under policies and procedures that require regular reviews of documentation, jurisdictions, and credit quality of protection providers.
pursuant to the basel iii final rule, we are permitted to reflect the application of credit risk mitigation which may include, for example, guarantees, collateral, netting, secured interests in non-financial assets and credit default swaps. state street does not actively use credit default swaps as a risk mitigation tool, although it increasingly applies the recognition of guarantees, collateral and security over non-financial assets to mitigate overall risk within its counterparty credit portfolio.
credit limits central to our philosophy for our management of credit risk is the approval and imposition of credit limits, against which we monitor the actual and potential future credit exposure arising from our business activities with counterparties or groups of counterparties. credit limits are a reflection of our risk appetite, which may be determined by the creditworthiness of the counterparty, the nature of the risk inherent in the business undertaken with the counterparty, or a combination of relevant credit factors. our risk appetite for certain sectors and certain countries and geographic regions may also influence the level of risk we are willing to assume to certain counterparties.
the analysis and approval of credit limits is undertaken in a consistent manner across our businesses, although the nature and extent of the analysis may vary, based on the type, term and magnitude of the risk being assumed. credit limits and underlying exposures are assessed and measured on both a gross and net basis where appropriate, with net exposure determined by deducting the value of any collateral held. for certain types of risk being assumed, we will also assess and measure exposures under a variety of hypothetical market conditions. credit limit approvals across state street are undertaken by the credit risk group, by individuals to whom credit authority has been delegated, or by the credit committee.
credit limits are re-evaluated annually, or more frequently as needed, and are revised periodically on prevailing and anticipated market conditions, changes in counterparty or country-specific credit ratings and outlook, changes in state street's risk appetite for certain counterparties, sectors or countries, and enhancements to the measurement of credit utilization.
reporting ongoing active monitoring and management of our credit risk is an integral part of our credit risk management framework. we maintain management information systems to identify, measure, monitor and report credit risk across businesses and legal entities, enabling erm and our businesses to have timely access to accurate information on credit limits and exposures. monitoring is performed along the dimensions of counterparty, industry, country and product-specific risks to facilitate the identification of concentrations of risk and emerging trends.
key aspects of this credit risk reporting structure include governance and oversight groups, policies that define standards for the reporting of credit risk, data aggregation and sourcing systems, and separate testing of relevant risk reporting functions by corporate audit.
the credit portfolio management group routinely assesses the composition of our overall credit risk portfolio for alignment with our stated risk appetite. this assessment includes routine analysis and reporting of the portfolio, monitoring of market-
85
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
based indicators, the assessment of industry trends and developments, and regular reviews of concentrated risks. the credit portfolio management group is also responsible, in conjunction with the business units, for defining the appetite for credit risk in the major sectors in which we have a concentration of business activities. these sector-level risk appetite statements, which include counterparty selection criteria and granular underwriting guidelines, are reviewed periodically and approved by the crpc.
monitoring regular surveillance of credit and counterparty risks is undertaken by our business units, the credit risk group and designees with erm, allowing for frequent and extensive oversight. this surveillance process includes, but is not limited to, the following components:
•   annual reviews. a formal review of counterparties is conducted at least annually and includes a thorough review of operating performance, primary risk factors and our internal credit risk rating. this annual review also includes a review of current and proposed credit limits, an assessment of our ongoing risk appetite and verification that supporting legal documentation remains effective.
•   interim monitoring. periodic monitoring of our largest and riskiest counterparties is undertaken more frequently, utilizing financial information, market indicators and other relevant credit and performance measures. the nature and extent of this interim monitoring is individually tailored to certain counterparties and/or industry sectors to identify material changes to the risk profile of a counterparty (or group of counterparties) and assign an updated internal risk rating in a timely manner.
we maintain an active "watch list" for all counterparties where we have identified a concern that the actual or potential risk of default has increased. the watch list status denotes a concern with some aspect of a counterparty's risk profile that warrants closer monitoring of the counterparty's financial performance and related risk factors. our ongoing monitoring processes are designed to facilitate the early identification of counterparties whose creditworthiness is deteriorating; any counterparty may be placed on the watch list by erm at its sole discretion.
counterparties that receive an internal risk rating within a certain range on our rating scale are eligible for watch list designation. these risk ratings generally correspond with the non-investment grade or near non-investment grade ratings established by the major independent credit-rating agencies, and also include the regulatory classifications of "special mention," "substandard," "doubtful" and "loss." counterparties whose internal ratings are outside this range may also be placed on the watch list.
the credit risk group maintains primary responsibility for our watch list processes, and generates a monthly report of all watch list counterparties. the watch list is formally reviewed at least on a quarterly basis, with participation from senior erm staff, and representatives from the business units and our corporate finance and legal groups as appropriate. these meetings include a review of individual watch list counterparties, together with credit limits and prevailing exposures, and are focused on actions to contain, reduce or eliminate the risk of loss to state street. identified actions are documented and monitored.
controls gcr provides a separate level of surveillance and oversight over the integrity of our credit risk management processes, including the internal risk-rating system. gcr reviews counterparty credit ratings for all identified sectors on an ongoing basis. gcr is subject to oversight by the crpc, and provides periodic updates to the board's rc.
specific activities of gcr include the following:
•   separate and objective assessments of our credit and counterparty exposures to determine the nature and extent of risk undertaken by the business units;
•   periodic credit process and credit product reviews, focusing on and assessing credit analysis, policy compliance, prudent transaction structure and underwriting standards, administration and documentation, risk-rating integrity, and relevant trends;
•   identification and monitoring of developing counterparty, market and/or industry sector trends to limit risk of loss and protect capital;
•   regular and formal reporting of reviews, including findings and requisite actions to remedy identified deficiencies;
•   allocation of resources for specialized risk assessments (on an as-needed basis);
•   assessment of the level of the allowance for loan and lease losses and otti; and
•   liaison with auditors and regulatory personnel on matters relating to risk rating, reporting, and measurement.
reserve for credit losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses to support our on-balance sheet credit exposures. we also maintain a reserve for unfunded commitments
86
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
and letters of credit to support our off-balance credit exposure. the two components together represent the reserve for credit losses. review and evaluation of the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses is ongoing throughout the year, but occurs at least quarterly, and is based, among other factors, on our evaluation of the level of risk in the portfolio, the volume of adversely classified loans, previous loss experience, current trends, and economic conditions and their effect on our counterparties. additional information about the allowance for loan losses is provided in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
liquidity risk management liquidity risk is defined as the potential that our financial condition or overall viability could be adversely affected by an actual or perceived inability to meet cash and collateral obligations. the goal of liquidity risk management is to maintain, even in the event of stress, our ability to meet our cash and collateral obligations.
liquidity is managed to meet our financial obligations in a timely and cost-effective manner, as well as maintain sufficient flexibility to fund strategic corporate initiatives as they arise. our effective management of liquidity involves the assessment of the potential mismatch between the future cash demands of our clients and our available sources of cash under both normal and adverse economic and business conditions.
we manage our liquidity on a global, consolidated basis. we also manage liquidity on a stand-alone basis at the parent company, as well as at certain branches and subsidiaries of state street bank. state street bank generally has access to markets and funding sources limited to banks, such as the federal funds market and the federal reserve's discount window. our parent company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile, reflecting narrower market access. our parent company typically holds enough cash, primarily in the form of interest-bearing deposits or time deposits with its banking subsidiaries, to meet its current debt maturities and cash needs, as well as those projected over the next one-year period. as of december 31, 2015, the value of our parent company's net liquid assets totaled $5.73 billion, compared with $6.03 billion as of december 31, 2014. as of december 31, 2015, our parent company and state street bank have approximately $1.0 billion and $400 million, respectively, of senior and subordinated notes outstanding that will mature in the next twelve months.
based on our level of consolidated liquid assets and our ability to access the capital markets for additional funding when necessary, including our ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current universal shelf registration, management considers our overall liquidity as of december 31, 2015 to be sufficient to meet its current commitments and business needs, including accommodating the transaction and cash management needs of its clients.
governance global treasury is responsible for our management of liquidity. this includes the day-to-day management of our global liquidity position, the development and monitoring of early warning indicators, key liquidity risk metrics, the creation and execution of stress tests, the evaluation and implementation of regulatory requirements, the maintenance and execution of our liquidity guidelines and contingency funding plan, and routine management reporting to alco, mrac and the board's rc.
global treasury risk management, part of erm, provides separate oversight over the identification, communication, and management of global treasury's risks in support of our business strategy. global treasury risk management reports to the cro. global treasury risk management's responsibilities relative to liquidity risk management include the development and review of policies and guidelines; the monitoring of limits related to adherence to the liquidity risk guidelines and associated reporting.
liquidity framework our liquidity framework contemplates areas of potential risk based on our activities, size, and other appropriate risk-related factors. in managing liquidity risk we employ limits, maintain established metrics and early warning indicators, and perform routine stress testing to identify potential liquidity needs. this process involves the evaluation of a combination of internal and external scenarios which assist us in measuring our liquidity position and in identifying potential increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash, as well as the potential impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets.
we manage liquidity according to several principles that are equally important to our overall liquidity risk management framework:
•   structural liquidity management addresses liquidity by monitoring and directing the composition of our consolidated statement of condition. structural liquidity is measured by metrics such as the percentage of total wholesale funds to consolidated total assets, and the percentage of non-government investment securities to client deposits. in
87
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
addition, on a regular basis and as described below, our structural liquidity is evaluated under various stress scenarios.
•   tactical liquidity management addresses our day-to-day funding requirements and is largely driven by changes in our primary source of funding, which are client deposits. fluctuations in client deposits may be supplemented with short-term borrowings, which generally include commercial paper and certificates of deposit.
•   stress testing and contingent funding planning are longer-term strategic liquidity risk management practices. regular and ad hoc liquidity stress testing are performed under various severe but plausible scenarios at the consolidated level and at significant subsidiaries, including state street bank. these tests contemplate severe market and state street-specific events under various time horizons and severities. tests contemplate the impact of material changes in key funding sources, credit ratings, additional collateral requirements, contingent uses of funding, systemic shocks to the financial markets, and operational failures based on market and state street-specific assumptions. the stress tests evaluate the required level of funding versus available sources in an adverse environment. as stress testing contemplates potential forward-looking scenarios, results also serve as a trigger to activate specific liquidity stress levels and contingent funding actions.
cfps are designed to assist senior management with decision-making associated with any contingency funding response to a possible or actual crisis scenario. the cfps define roles, responsibilities and management actions to be taken in the event of deterioration of our liquidity profile caused by either a state street-specific event or a broader disruption in the capital markets. specific actions are linked to the level of stress indicated by these measures or by management judgment of market conditions.
liquidity risk metrics in managing our liquidity, we employ early warning indicators and metrics. early warning indicators are intended to detect situations which may result in a liquidity stress, including changes in our common stock price and the spread on our long-term debt. additional metrics that are critical to the management of our consolidated statement of condition and monitored as part of our routine liquidity management include measures of our fungible cash position, purchased wholesale funds, unencumbered liquid assets, deposits, and the total of investment securities and loans as a percentage of total client deposits.
asset liquidity central to the management of our liquidity is asset liquidity, which consists primarily of unencumbered highly liquid securities, cash and cash equivalents reported on our consolidated statement of condition. we restrict the eligibility of securities of asset liquidity to u.s. government and federal agency securities (including mortgage-backed securities), selected non-u.s. government and supranational securities as well as certain other high- quality securities which generally are more liquid than other types of assets even in times of stress. our asset liquidity metric is similar to the hqla under the u.s. lcr, and our hqla, under the lcr final rule definition, were estimated to be $109.39 billion and $115.58 billion as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively.
table 32: components of hqla by type of asset
(in millions)                              december 31, 2015               december 31, 2014

total                                       $109,394                        $115,583
with respect to highly liquid short-term investments presented in the preceding table, due to the continued elevated level of client deposits as of december 31, 2015, we maintained cash balances in excess of regulatory requirements governing deposits with the federal reserve of approximately $66.06 billion at the federal reserve, the ecb and other non-u.s. central banks, compared to $85.18 billion as of december 31, 2014. the increase in investment securities as of december 31, 2015 compared to december 31, 2014, presented in the table, was mainly associated with repositioning the investment portfolio in light of the liquidity requirements of the lcr.
liquid securities carried in our asset liquidity include securities pledged without corresponding advances from the federal reserve bank of boston, or frb, the federal home loan bank of boston, or fhlb, and other non-u.s. central banks. state street bank is a member of the fhlb. this membership allows for advances of liquidity in varying terms against high-quality collateral, which helps facilitate asset-and-liability management.
access to primary, intra-day and contingent liquidity provided by these utilities is an important source of contingent liquidity with utilization subject to underlying conditions. as of december 31, 2015 and
88
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
december 31, 2014, we had no outstanding primary credit borrowings from the frb discount window or any other central bank facility, and as of the same dates, no fhlb advances were outstanding.
in addition to the securities included in our asset liquidity, we have significant amounts of other unencumbered investment securities. the aggregate fair value of those securities was $41.00 billion as of december 31, 2015, compared to $60.06 billion as of december 31, 2014. these securities are available sources of liquidity, although not as rapidly deployed as those included in our asset liquidity.
measures of liquidity include lcr, nsfr and tlac which are described in "supervision and regulation" included under item 1, "business" of this form 10-k.
uses of liquidity significant uses of our liquidity could result from the following: withdrawals of client deposits; draw-downs of unfunded commitments to extend credit or to purchase securities, generally provided through lines of credit; and short-duration advance facilities. such circumstances would generally arise under stress conditions including deterioration in credit ratings. we had unfunded commitments to extend credit with gross contractual amounts totaling $22.58 billion and $24.25 billion as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively. these amounts do not reflect the value of any collateral. as of december 31, 2015, approximately 76% of our unfunded commitments to extend credit expire within one year. since many of our commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn upon, the gross contractual amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements.
funding deposits we provide products and services including custody, accounting, administration, daily pricing, foreign exchange services, cash management, financial asset management, securities finance and investment advisory services. as a provider of these products and services, we generate client deposits, which have generally provided a stable, low-cost source of funds. as a global custodian, clients place deposits with state street entities in various currencies. we invest these client deposits in a combination of investment securities and short-duration financial instruments whose mix is determined by the characteristics of the deposits.
for the past several years, we have experienced higher client deposit inflows toward the end of each fiscal quarter or the end of the fiscal year. as a result, we believe average client deposit balances are more reflective of ongoing funding than period-end balances.

(1)  balance as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 excluded term wholesale cds of $13.72 billion and $13.76 billion, respectively; average balances for the years ended december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 excluded average cds of $13.56 billion and $6.87 billion, respectively.
short-term funding our corporate commercial paper program had zero and $2.48 billion of commercial paper outstanding as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively. state street phased-out its commercial paper program prior to december 31, 2015, consistent with the objectives of its 2015 recovery and resolution plan developed pursuant to the requirements of the dodd-frank act.
our on-balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy. these assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets, but more importantly, they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales. in addition, our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability to source incremental funding at reasonable rates of interest from wholesale investors. as discussed earlier under "asset liquidity," state street bank's membership in the fhlb allows for advances of liquidity with varying terms against high-quality collateral.
short-term secured funding also comes in the form of securities lent or sold under agreements to repurchase. these transactions are short-term in nature, generally overnight, and are collateralized by high-quality investment securities. these balances were $4.50 billion and $8.93 billion as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively.
state street bank currently maintains a line of credit with a financial institution of cad $1.40 billion, or approximately $1.09 billion as of december 31, 2015, to support its canadian securities processing operations. the line of credit has no stated termination date and is cancelable by either party with prior notice. as of december 31, 2015, there was no balance outstanding on this line of credit.
89
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
long-term funding as of december 31, 2015, state street bank had board authority to issue unsecured senior debt securities from time to time, provided that the aggregate principal amount of such unsecured senior debt outstanding at any one time does not exceed $5 billion. as of december 31, 2015, $5 billion was available for issuance pursuant to this authority. as of december 31, 2015, state street bank also had board authority to issue an additional $500 million of subordinated debt.
state street corporation maintains an effective universal shelf registration that allows for the public offering and sale of debt securities, capital securities, common stock, depositary shares and preferred stock, and warrants to purchase such securities, including any shares into which the preferred stock and depositary shares may be convertible, or any combination thereof. we have issued in the past, and we may issue in the future, securities pursuant to our shelf registration. the issuance of debt or equity securities will depend on future market conditions, funding needs and other factors.
agency credit ratings our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment-grade ratings as measured by the major independent credit rating agencies. factors essential to maintaining high credit ratings include diverse and stable core earnings; relative market position; strong risk management; strong capital ratios; diverse liquidity sources, including the global capital markets and client deposits; strong liquidity monitoring procedures; and preparedness for current or future regulatory developments. high ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by providing assurance for unsecured funding and depositors, increasing the potential market for our debt and improving our ability to offer products, serve markets, and engage in transactions in which clients value high credit ratings. a downgrade or reduction of our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity by restricting our ability to access the capital markets, which could increase the related cost of funds. in turn, this could cause the sudden and large-scale withdrawal of unsecured deposits by our clients, which could lead to draw-downs of unfunded commitments to extend credit or trigger requirements under securities purchase commitments; or require additional collateral or force terminations of certain trading derivative contracts.
a majority of our derivative contracts have been entered into under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings. we assess the impact of these arrangements by determining the collateral or termination payments that would be required assuming a downgrade by all rating agencies. the additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under these arrangements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings below levels specified in the agreements is disclosed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k. other funding sources, such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
operational risk management overview we consider operational risk to be the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, human error, or from external events. operational risk encompasses fiduciary risk and legal risk. fiduciary risk is defined as the risk that state street fails to properly exercise its fiduciary duties in its provision of products or services to clients. legal risk is the risk of loss resulting from failure to comply with laws and contractual obligations as well as prudent ethical standards in business practices in addition to exposure to litigation from all aspects of the state street's activities.
operational risk is inherent in the performance of investment servicing and investment management activities on behalf of our clients. whether it be fiduciary risk, risk associated with execution and processing or other types of operational risk, a consistent, transparent and effective operational risk framework is key to identifying, monitoring and managing operational risk.
we have established an operational risk framework that is based on three major goals:
•strong, active governance;
•ownership and accountability; and
•consistency and transparency.
governance our board is responsible for the approval and oversight of our overall operational risk framework. it does so through its rc, which reviews our operational risk framework and approves our operational risk policy annually.
our operational risk policy establishes our approach to our management of operational risk across state street. the policy identifies the responsibilities of individuals and committees charged with oversight of the management of operational risk, and articulates a broad mandate that supports implementation of the operational risk framework.
erm and other control groups provide the oversight, validation and verification of the management and measurement of operational risk.
executive management actively manages and oversees our operational risk framework through membership on various risk management committees, including mrac, the bcrc, torc, the operational risk committee, the executive information security committee, and the fiduciary review committee, all of which ultimately report to the appropriate committee of the board.
the operational risk committee, chaired by the global head of operational risk, provides cross-
business oversight of operational risk and reviews and approves operational risk guidelines intended to maintain a consistent implementation of our corporate operational risk policy and framework.
ownership and accountability we have implemented our operational risk framework to support the broad mandate established by our operational risk policy. this framework represents an integrated set of processes and tools that assists us in the management and measurement of operational risk, including our calculation of required capital and rwa.
the framework takes a comprehensive view and integrates the methods and tools used to manage and measure operational risk. the framework utilizes aspects of the coso framework and other industry leading practices, and is designed foremost to address state street's risk management needs while complying with regulatory requirements. the operational risk framework is intended to provide a number of important benefits, including:
•   a common understanding of operational risk management and its supporting processes;
•   the clarification of responsibilities for the management of operational risk across state street;
•   the alignment of business priorities with risk management objectives;
•   the active management of risk and early identification of emerging risks;
•   the consistent application of policies and the collection of data for risk management and measurement; and
•   the estimation of our operational risk capital requirement.
the operational risk framework employs a distributed risk management infrastructure executed by erm groups aligned with the business units, which are responsible for the implementation of the operational risk framework at the business unit level.
as with other risks, senior business unit management is responsible for the day-to-day operational risk management of their respective businesses. it is business unit management's responsibility to provide oversight of the implementation and ongoing execution of the operational risk framework within their respective organizations, as well as coordination and communication with erm.
consistency and transparency a number of corporate control functions are directly responsible for implementing and assessing various aspects of state street's operational risk framework, with the overarching goal of consistency
92
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
and transparency to meet the evolving needs of the business:
•   the global head of operational risk, a member of the cro's executive management team, leads erm's corporate orm group. orm is responsible for the strategy, evolution and consistent implementation of our operational risk guidelines, framework and supporting tools across state street. orm reviews and analyzes operational key risk information, events, metrics and indicators at the business unit and corporate level for purposes of risk management, reporting and escalation to the cro, senior management and governance committees;
•   erm's corporate risk analytics group develops and maintains operational risk capital estimation models, and erm's operations group calculates state street's required capital for operational risk;
•   erm's mvg independently validates the quantitative models used to measure operational risk, and orm performs validation checks on the output of the model;
•   cis establishes the framework, policies and related programs to measure, monitor and report on information security risks, including the effectiveness of cyber security program protections.
cis defines and manages the enterprise-wide information security program. cis coordinates with information technology, control functions and business units to support the confidentiality, integrity and availability of corporate information assets. cis identifies and employs a risk-based methodology consistent with applicable regulatory cyber security requirements and monitors the compliance of our systems with information security policies; and
•   corporate audit performs separate reviews of the application of operational risk management practices and methodologies utilized across state street.
our operational risk framework consists of five components, each described below, which provide a working structure that integrates distinct risk programs into a continuous process focused on managing and measuring operational risk in a coordinated and consistent manner.
risk identification, assessment and measurement the objective of risk identification, assessment and measurement is to understand business unit strategy, risk profile and potential exposures. it is achieved through a series of risk assessments across state street using techniques for the identification, assessment and measurement of risk across a spectrum of potential frequency and severity combinations. three primary risk assessment programs, which occur annually, augmented by other business-specific programs, are the core of this component:
•   the rcsa program seeks to understand the risks associated with day-to-day activities, and the effectiveness of controls intended to manage potential exposures arising from these activities. these risks are typically frequent in nature but generally not severe in terms of exposure;
•   the material risk identification process utilizes a bottom-up approach to identify state street's most significant risk exposures across all on- and off-balance sheet risk-taking activities. the program is specifically designed to consider risks that could have a material impact irrespective of their likelihood or frequency. this can include risks that may have an impact on longer-term business objectives, such as significant change management activities or long-term strategic initiatives;
•   the scenario analysis program focuses on the set of risks with the highest severity and most relevance from a capital perspective. these are generally referred to as "tail risks," and serve as important benchmarks for our loss distribution approach model (see below); they also provide inputs into stress testing; and
•   business-specific programs to identify, assess and measure risk, including new business and product review and approval, new client screening, and, as deemed appropriate, targeted risk assessments.
the primary measurement tool used is an internally developed loss distribution approach model, referred to as the lda model. we use the lda model to quantify required operational risk capital, from which we calculate rwa related to operational risk. such required capital and rwa totaled $43.88 billion as of december 31, 2015; refer to the "capital" section of this management's discussion and analysis.
the lda model incorporates the four required operational risk elements described below:
•   internal loss event data is collected from across state street in conformity with our operating loss policy that establishes the requirements for collecting and reporting individual loss events. we categorize the
93
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
data into seven basel-defined event types and further subdivide the data by business unit, as deemed appropriate. each of these loss events are represented in a uom which is used to estimate a specific amount of capital required for the types of loss events that fall into each specific category. some uoms are measured at the corporate level because they are not "business specific," such as damage to physical assets, where the cause of an event is not primarily driven by the behavior of a single business unit. internal losses of $500 or greater are captured, analyzed and included in the modeling approach. loss event data is collected using a corporate-wide data collection tool, which stores the data in a loss event data repository, referred to as the ledr, to support processes related to analysis, management reporting and the calculation of required capital. internal loss event data provides state street-specific frequency and severity information to our capital calculation process for historical loss events experienced by state street.
•   external loss event data provides information with respect to loss event severity from other financial institutions to inform our capital estimation process of events in similar business units at other banking organizations. this information supplements the data pool available for use in our lda model. assessments of the sufficiency of internal data and the relevance of external data are completed before pooling the two data sources for use in our lda model.
•   scenario analysis workshops are conducted annually across state street to inform management of the less frequent but most severe, or "tail," risks that the organization faces. the workshops are attended by senior business unit managers, other support and control partners and business-aligned risk management staff. the workshops are designed to capture information about the significant risks and to estimate potential exposures for individual risks should a loss event occur. workshops are aligned with specific uoms and business units where appropriate. the results of these workshops are used to benchmark our lda model results to determine that our calculation of required capital considers relevant risk-related information.
•   business environment and internal control factors are gathered as part of our scenario analysis program to inform the scenario analysis workshop participants of internal loss event data and business-relevant metrics, such as rcsa results, along with industry loss event data and case studies where appropriate. business environment and internal control factors are those characteristics of a bank's internal and external operating environment that bear an exposure to operational risk. the use of this information indirectly influences our calculation of required capital by providing additional relevant data to workshop participants when reviewing specific uom risks.
monitoring the objective of risk monitoring is to proactively monitor the changing business environment and corresponding operational risk exposure. it is achieved through a series of quantitative and qualitative monitoring tools that are designed to allow us to understand changes in the business environment, internal control factors, risk metrics, risk assessments, exposures and operating effectiveness, as well as details of loss events and progress on risk initiatives implemented to mitigate potential risk exposures.
effectiveness and testing the objective of effectiveness and testing is to verify that internal controls are designed appropriately, are consistent with corporate and regulatory standards, and are operating effectively. it is achieved through a series of assessments by both internal and external parties, including corporate audit, independent registered public accounting firms, business self-assessments and other control function reviews, such as a sarbanes-oxley testing program.
consistent with our standard model validation process, the operational risk lda model is subject to a detailed review, overseen by the mrc. in addition, the model is subject to a rigorous internal governance process. all changes to the model or input parameters, and the deployment of model updates, are reviewed and approved by the operational risk committee, which has oversight responsibility for the model, with technical input from the mrc.
reporting operational risk reporting is intended to provide transparency, thereby enabling management to manage risk, provide oversight and escalate issues in a timely manner. it is designed to allow the business units, executive management, and the board's control functions and committees to gain insight into activities that may result in risks and potential exposures. reports are intended to identify business activities that are experiencing processing issues, whether or
94
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
not they result in actual loss events. reporting includes results of monitoring activities, internal and external examinations, regulatory reviews, and control assessments. these elements combine in a manner designed to provide a view of potential and emerging risks facing state street and information that details its progress on managing risks.
documentation and guidelines documentation and guidelines allow for consistency and repeatability of the various processes that support the operational risk framework across state street.
operational risk guidelines document our practices and describe the key elements in a business unit's operational risk management program. the purpose of the guidelines is to set forth and define key operational risk terms, provide further detail on state street's operational risk programs, and detail the business units' responsibilities to identify, assess, measure, monitor and report operational risk. the guideline supports our operational risk policy.
data standards have been established to maintain consistent data repositories and systems that are controlled, accurate and available on a timely basis to support operational risk management.
market risk management market risk is defined by u.s. banking regulators as the risk of loss that could result from broad market movements, such as changes in the general level of interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. we are exposed to market risk in both our trading and certain of our non-trading, or asset-and-liability management, activities.
information about the market risk associated with our trading activities is provided below under "trading activities." information about the market risk associated with our non-trading activities, which consists primarily of interest-rate risk, is provided below under "asset-and-liability management activities."
trading activities in the conduct of our trading activities, we assume market risk, the level of which is a function of our overall risk appetite, business objectives and liquidity needs, our clients' requirements and market volatility, and our execution against those factors.
we engage in trading activities primarily to support our clients' needs and to contribute to our overall corporate earnings and liquidity. in connection with certain of these trading activities, we enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to support our clients' needs and to manage our interest-rate and currency risk. these activities are generally intended to generate trading services revenue and to manage potential earnings volatility. in addition, we provide services related to derivatives in our role as both a manager and a servicer of financial assets.
our clients use derivatives to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business activities. with the growth of cross-border investing, our clients often enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investments and to manage the currency risk in their international investment portfolios. as an active participant in the foreign exchange markets, we provide foreign exchange forward and option contracts in support of these client needs, and also act as a dealer in the currency markets.
as part of our trading activities, we assume positions in the foreign exchange and interest-rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and entering into derivative instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange and interest-rate options and interest-rate swaps, interest-rate forward contracts, and interest-rate futures. as of december 31, 2015, the notional amount of these derivative contracts was $1.29 trillion, of which $1.28 trillion was composed of foreign exchange forward, swap and spot contracts. we seek to match positions closely with the objective of minimizing related currency and interest-rate risk. all foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates.
governance our assumption of market risk in our trading activities is an integral part of our corporate risk appetite. our board reviews and oversees our management of market risk, including the approval of key market risk policies and the receipt and review of regular market risk reporting, as well as periodic updates on selected market risk topics.
the previously described tmrc (refer to "risk committees") oversees all market risk-taking activities across state street associated with trading. the tmrc, which reports to mrac, is composed of members of erm, our global markets business and our global treasury group, as well as our senior executives who manage our trading businesses and other members of management who possess specialized knowledge and expertise. the tmrc meets regularly to monitor the management of our trading market risk activities.
our business units identify, actively manage and are responsible for the market risks inherent in their businesses. a dedicated market risk management group within erm, and other groups within erm, work with those business units to assist them in the identification, assessment, monitoring, management and control of market risk, and assist business unit managers with their market risk management and measurement activities. erm provides an additional line of oversight, support and coordination designed
95
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
to promote the consistent identification, measurement and management of market risk across business units, separate from those business units' discrete activities.
the erm market risk management group is responsible for the management of corporate-wide market risk, the monitoring of key market risks and the development and maintenance of market risk management policies, guidelines, and standards aligned with our corporate risk appetite. this group also establishes and approves market risk tolerance limits and trading authorities based on, but not limited to, measures of notional amounts, sensitivity, var and stress. such limits and authorities are specified in our trading and market risk guidelines which govern our management of trading market risk.
corporate audit separately assesses the design and operating effectiveness of the market risk controls within our business units and erm. other related responsibilities of corporate audit include the periodic review of erm and business unit compliance with market risk policies, guidelines, and corporate standards, as well as relevant regulatory requirements. we are subject to regular monitoring, reviews and supervisory exams of our market risk function by the federal reserve. in addition, we are regulated by, among others, the sec, the financial industry regulatory authority and the u.s. commodities futures trading commission.
risk appetite our corporate market risk appetite is specified in policy statements that outline the governance, responsibilities and requirements surrounding the identification, measurement, analysis, management and communication of market risk arising from our trading activities. these policy statements also set forth the market risk control framework to monitor, support, manage and control this portion of our risk appetite. all groups involved in the management and control of market risk associated with trading activities are required to comply with the qualitative and quantitative elements of these policy statements. our trading market risk control framework is composed of the following components:
•   a trading market risk management process led by erm, separate from the business units' discrete activities;
•   clearly defined responsibilities and authorities for the primary groups involved in trading market risk management;
•   a trading market risk measurement methodology that captures correlation effects and allows aggregation of market risk across risk types, markets and business lines;
•   daily monitoring, analysis, and reporting of market risk exposures associated with trading activities against market risk limits;
•   a defined limit structure and escalation process in the event of a market risk limit excess;
•   use of var models to measure the one-day market risk exposure of trading positions;
•   use of var as a ten-day-based regulatory capital measure of the market risk exposure of trading positions;
•   use of non-var-based limits and other controls;
•   use of stressed-var models, stress-testing analysis and scenario analysis to support the trading market risk measurement and management process by assessing how portfolios and global business lines perform under extreme market conditions;
•   use of back-testing as a diagnostic tool to assess the accuracy of var models and other risk management techniques; and
•   a new product approval process that requires market risk teams to assess trading-related market risks and apply risk tolerance limits to proposed new products and business activities.
we use our cap to assess our overall capital and liquidity in relation to our risk profile and provide a comprehensive strategy for maintaining appropriate capital and liquidity levels. with respect to market risk associated with trading activities, our risk management and our calculations of regulatory and economic capital are based primarily on our internal var models and stress testing analysis. as discussed in detail under "value-at-risk" below, var is measured daily by erm.
the tmrc oversees our market risk exposure in relation to limits established within our risk appetite framework. these limits define threshold levels for var- and stressed var-based measures and are applicable to all trading positions subject to regulatory capital requirements. these limits are designed to prevent any undue concentration of market risk exposure, in light of the primarily non-proprietary nature of our trading activities. the risk appetite framework and associated limits are reviewed and approved by the board's rc.
96
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
covered positions our trading positions are subject to regulatory market risk capital requirements if they meet the regulatory definition of a "covered position." a covered position is generally defined by u.s. banking regulators as an on- or off-balance sheet position associated with the organization's trading activities that is free of any restrictions on its tradability, but does not include intangible assets, certain credit derivatives recognized as guarantees and certain equity positions not publicly traded. all fx and commodity positions are considered covered positions, regardless of the accounting treatment they receive. the identification of covered positions for inclusion in our market risk capital framework is governed by our covered positions policy, which outlines the standards we use to determine whether a trading position is a covered position.
our covered positions consist primarily of the trading portfolios held by our global markets business. they also arise from certain positions held by our global treasury group. these trading positions include products such as spot foreign exchange, foreign exchange forwards, non-deliverable forwards, foreign exchange options, foreign exchange funding swaps, currency futures, financial futures, and interest rate futures. new activities are analyzed to determine if the positions arising from such new activities meet the definition of a covered position and conform to our covered positions policy. this documented analysis, including any decisions with respect to market risk treatments, must receive approval from the tmrc.
we use spot rates, forward points, yield curves and discount factors imported from third-party sources to measure the value of our covered positions, and we use such values to mark our covered positions to market on a daily basis. these values are subject to separate validation by us in order to evaluate reasonableness and consistency with market experience. the mark-to-market gain or loss on spot transactions is calculated by applying the spot rate to the foreign currency principal and comparing the resultant base currency amount to the original transaction principal. the mark-to-market gain or loss on a forward foreign exchange contract or forward cash flow contract is determined as the difference between the life-to-date (historical) value of the cash flow and the value of the cash flow at the inception of the transaction. the mark-to-market gain or loss on interest-rate swaps is determined by discounting the future cash flows from each leg of the swap transaction.
value-at-risk, stress testing and stressed var as noted above, we use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies, including var, which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval. we use a risk measurement methodology to measure trading-related var daily. we have adopted standards for measuring trading-related var, and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk associated with our trading activities in conformity with currently applicable bank regulatory market risk requirements.
we utilize an internal var model to calculate our regulatory market risk capital requirements. we use a historical simulation model to calculate daily var- and stressed var-based measures for our covered positions in conformity with regulatory requirements. our var model seeks to capture identified material risk factors associated with our covered positions, including risks arising from market movements such as changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and option-implied volatilities.
we have adopted standards and guidelines to value our covered positions which govern our var- and stressed var-based measures. our regulatory var-based measure is calculated based on historical volatilities of market risk factors during a two-year observation period calibrated to a one-tail, 99% confidence interval and a ten-business-day holding period. we also use the same platform to calculate a one-tail, 99% confidence interval, one-business-day var for internal risk management purposes. a 99% one-tail confidence interval implies that daily trading losses are not expected to exceed the estimated var more than 1% of the time, or less than three business days out of a year.
our market risk models, including our var model, are subject to change in connection with the governance, validation and back-testing processes described below. these models can change as a result of changes in our business activities, our historical experiences, market forces and events, regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors. in addition, the models are subject to continuing regulatory review and approval. changes in our models may result in changes in our measurements of our market risk exposures, including var, and related measures, including regulatory capital. these changes could result in material changes in those risk measurements and related measures as calculated and compared from period to period.
value-at-risk var measures are based on the most recent two years of historical price movements for instruments and related risk factors to which we have exposure. the instruments in question are limited to foreign exchange spot, forward and options contracts and interest-rate contracts, including futures and interest-rate swaps. historically, these instruments
97
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
have exhibited a higher degree of liquidity relative to other available capital markets instruments. as a result, the var measures shown reflect our ability to rapidly adjust exposures in highly dynamic markets. for this reason, risk inventory, in the form of net open positions, across all currencies is typically limited. in addition, long and short positions in major, as well as minor, currencies provide risk offsets that limit our potential downside exposure.
our var methodology uses a historical simulation approach based on market-observed changes in foreign exchange rates, u.s. and non-u.s. interest rates and implied volatilities, and incorporates the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of our trading positions. our var model incorporates approximately 5,000 risk factors and includes correlations among currency, interest rates, and other market rates.
all var measures are subject to limitations and must be interpreted accordingly. some, but not all, of the limitations of our var methodology include the following:
•   compared to a shorter observation period, a two-year observation period is slower to reflect increases in market volatility (although temporary increases in market volatility will affect the calculation of var for a longer period); consequently, in periods of sudden increases in volatility or increasing volatility, in each case relative to the prior two-year period, the calculation of var may understate current risk;
•   compared to a longer observation period, a two-year observation period may not reflect as many past periods of volatility in the markets, because such past volatility is no longer in the observation period; consequently, historical market scenarios of high volatility, even if similar to current or likely future market circumstances, may fall outside the two-year observation period, resulting in a potential understatement of current risk;
•   the var-based measure is calibrated to a specified level of confidence and does not indicate the potential magnitude of losses beyond this confidence level;
•   in certain cases, var-based measures approximate the impact of changes in risk factors on the values of positions and portfolios; this may happen because the number of inputs included in the var model is necessarily limited; for example, yield curve risk factors do not exist for all future dates;
•   the use of historical market information may not be predictive of future events, particularly those that are extreme in nature; this "backward-looking" limitation can cause var to understate or overstate risk;
•   the effect of extreme and rare market movements is difficult to estimate; this may result from non-linear risk sensitivities as well as the potential for actual volatility and correlation levels to differ from assumptions implicit in the var calculations; and
•   intra-day risk is not captured.
stress testing and stressed var we have a corporate-wide stress testing program in place that incorporates an array of techniques to measure the potential loss we could suffer in a hypothetical scenario of adverse economic and financial conditions. we also monitor concentrations of risk such as concentration by branch, risk component, and currency pairs. we conduct stress testing on a daily basis based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market conditions recur, and we also perform stress testing as part of the federal reserve's ccar process. stress testing is conducted, analyzed and reported at the corporate, trading desk, division and risk-factor level (for example, exchange risk, interest-rate risk and volatility risk).
we calculate a stressed var-based measure using the same model we use to calculate var, but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a range of continuous twelve-month periods that reflect significant financial stress. the stressed var model identifies the second-worst outcome occurring in the worst continuous one-year rolling period since july 2007. this stressed var meets the regulatory requirement as the rolling ten-day period with an outcome that is worse than 99% of other outcomes during that twelve-month period of financial stress. for each portfolio, the stress period is determined algorithmically by seeking the one-year time horizon that produces the largest ten-business-day var from within the available historical data. this historical data set includes the financial crisis of 2008, the highly volatile period surrounding the eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the standard & poor's downgrade of u.s. treasury debt in august 2011. as the historical data set used to determine the stress period expands over time, future market stress events will be automatically incorporated.
we perform scenario analysis daily based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market
98
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
conditions recur. relevant scenarios are chosen from an inventory of historical financial stresses and applied to our current portfolio. these historical event scenarios involve spot foreign exchange, credit, equity, unforeseen geo-political events and natural disasters, and government and central bank intervention scenarios. examples of the specific historical scenarios we incorporate in our stress testing program may include the asian financial crisis of 1997, the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the u.s., and the 2008 financial crisis. we continue to update our inventory of historical stress scenarios as new stress conditions emerge in the financial markets.
as each of the historical stress events is associated with a different time horizon, we normalize results by scaling down the longer horizon events to a ten-day horizon and keeping the shorter horizon events (i.e., events that are shorter than ten days) at their original terms. we also conduct sensitivity analysis daily to calculate the impact of a large predefined shock in a specific risk factor or a group of risk factors on our current portfolio. these predefined shocks include parallel and non-parallel yield curve shifts and foreign exchange spot and volatility surface shifts. in a parallel shift scenario, we apply a constant factor shift across all yield curve tenors. in a non-parallel shift scenario, we apply different shock levels to different tenors of a yield curve, rather than shifting the entire curve by a constant amount. non-parallel shifts include steepening, flattening and butterflies.
stress testing results and limits are actively monitored on a daily basis by erm and reported to the tmrc. limit breaches are addressed by erm risk managers in conjunction with the business units, escalated as appropriate, and reviewed by the tmrc if material. in addition, we have established several action triggers that prompt immediate review by management and the implementation of a remediation plan.
validation and back-testing we perform frequent back-testing to assess the accuracy of our var-based model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level. this back-testing involves the comparison of estimated var model outputs to daily, actual profit-and-loss outcomes, or p&l, observed from daily market movements. we back-test our var model using "clean" p&l, which excludes non-trading revenue such as fees, commissions and net interest revenue, as well as estimated revenue from intra-day trading. our var definition of trading losses excludes items that are not specific to the price movement of the trading assets and liabilities themselves, such as fees, commissions, changes to reserves and gains or losses from intra-day activity.
we experienced one back-testing exception in 2015, which occurred in the third quarter. the trading p&l that day exceeded the var based on the prior day's closing positions, following a large depreciation in the u.s. dollar against several major and emerging market currencies, which depreciation can be attributed to a decision and related statements by the federal reserve's federal open market committee to hold interest rates at current levels. we experienced no back-testing exceptions for the full-year of 2014.
our market risk models are governed by our model risk governance guidelines, in conformity with our model risk governance policy. our market risk models are subject to regular review and validation by mvg within erm and overseen by the mrc. additional information about the mrc and mvg is provided under "model risk management" in this disclosure.
as part of its responsibilities, the mrc evaluates model soundness by assessing the quality of the model design and construction, as well as reviewing documentation and empirical evidence supporting the methods used for the model based on the recommendations of mvg. in addition, the mrc considers technical modeling issues for our market risk models, including the selection of an appropriate modeling approach, the setting of key model input assumptions, the deployment of substantive model changes, the deployment of new models as needed, and the monitoring of ongoing model performance.
consistent with regulatory requirements, our market risk regulatory capital models are subject to an annual review process and a validation schedule with frequency based on the model tier. mvg conducts the periodic reviews and validations of our market risk models, and their process identifies the areas of model risk for the three model components (input, processing and output), model implementation, and ongoing monitoring. model testing is concentrated in the areas of model risk identified by mvg. mvg is responsible for the results of this annual review or validation, and for determining whether a model should be approved for a desired use. mvg communicates their result as one of the following three outcomes: "approved", "approved with conditions", or "not approved".
our model validation process also evaluates the integrity of our var models through the use of regular outcome analysis. such outcome analysis includes back-testing, which compares the var model's predictions to actual outcomes using out-of-sample information. mvg examined back testing results for the market risk regulatory capital model used for
99
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
2012. consistent with regulatory guidance, the back-testing compared "clean" p&l, defined above, with the one-day var produced by the model. the back-testing was performed for a time period not used for model development. the number of occurrences where "clean" trading-book p&l exceeded the one-day var was within our expected var tolerance level.
market risk reporting our erm market risk management group is responsible for market risk monitoring and reporting. we use a variety of systems and controlled market feeds from third-party services to compile data for several daily, weekly, and monthly management reports.
our business units and trading market risk teams review daily p&l, market risk limit exceptions, open positions, interest-rate and option sensitivities and var reports on a daily basis. market risk limit exceptions are also reported to and reviewed by the global head of market risk. we produce and review several other reports that summarize relevant market risk metrics, including var, on a periodic basis.

the twelve month average of our stressed var-based measure was approximately $63 million for the period ended december 31, 2015, compared to a twelve month average of approximately $62 million for the period ended december 31, 2014.
the increase in the twelve month average of our stressed var-based measure for the period ended december 31, 2015, compared to the period ended december 31, 2014, was primarily the result of an extension of the tenor of fx swaps used by global treasury designed to improve our liquidity position. although the fx swaps are not considered part of our trading activity, all fx activity (trading or banking) generates market risk captured under basel rules. the tenor extension gives rise to additional market risk in our stressed var calculation.
the var-based measures presented in the preceding tables are primarily a reflection of the overall level of market volatility and our appetite for trading market risk. overall levels of volatility have been low both on an absolute basis and relative to the historical information observed at the beginning of the period used for the calculations. both the ten-day var-based measures and the stressed var-based measures are based on historical changes observed during rolling ten-day periods for the portfolios as of the close of business each day over the past one-year period.
we may in the future modify and adjust our models and methodologies used to calculate var and stressed var, subject to regulatory review and approval, and these modifications and adjustments may result in changes in our var-based and stressed var-based measures.

the following tables present the var and stressed-var associated with our trading activities attributable to foreign exchange risk, interest-rate risk and volatility risk as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014. the totals of the var-based and stressed var-based measures for the three attributes for each var and stressed-var component exceeded the related total var and total stressed var presented in the foregoing tables as of each period-end, primarily due to the benefits of diversification across risk types.

(1) for purposes of risk attribution by component, in both tables 39 and 40,  foreign exchange refers only to the risk from market movements in period-end rates.  forwards, futures, options and swaps with maturities greater than period-end have embedded interest-rate risk that is captured by the measures used for interest-rate risk.  accordingly, the interest-rate risk embedded in these foreign exchange instruments is included in the interest-rate risk component.
the decline in the total ten-day var based measure as of december 31, 2015, as compared to december 31, 2014, is the result of a decline in exposure that arose from the tenor extension strategy initiated by global treasury late last year.
asset-and-liability management activities the primary objective of asset-and-liability management is to provide sustainable nir, under varying economic conditions, while protecting the economic value of the assets and liabilities carried in our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. while many market factors affect the level of nir and the economic value of our assets and liabilities, one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates. most of our nir is earned from the investment of client deposits generated by our businesses. we invest these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, including the currency composition of our significant non-u.s. dollar denominated client liabilities, but we manage our overall interest-rate risk position in the context of current and anticipated market conditions and within internally-approved risk guidelines.
our overall interest-rate risk position is maintained within a series of policies approved by the board and guidelines established and monitored by alco. our global treasury group has responsibility for managing our day-to-day interest-rate risk. to effectively manage our consolidated statement of condition and related nir, global treasury has the authority to assume a limited amount of interest-rate risk based on market conditions and its views about the direction of global interest rates over both short-term and long-term time horizons. global treasury manages our exposure to changes in interest rates on a consolidated basis organized into three regional treasury units, north america, europe and asia/pacific, to reflect the growing, global nature of our exposures and to capture the impact of changes in regional market environments on our total risk position.
the economic value of our consolidated statement of condition is a metric designed to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities which could be garnered if those assets and liabilities were sold immediately. the economic values represent discounted cash flows from all financial instruments; therefore, changes in the yield curves, which are used to discount the cash flows, affect the values of these instruments.
our investment activities and our use of derivative financial instruments are the primary tools used in managing interest-rate risk. we invest in financial instruments with currency, repricing, and maturity characteristics we consider appropriate to manage our overall interest-rate risk position. in addition, we use certain derivative instruments, primarily interest-rate swaps, to alter the interest-rate

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
characteristics of specific balance sheet assets or liabilities.
because no one individual measure can accurately assess all of our exposures to changes in interest rates, we use several quantitative measures in our assessment of current and potential future exposures to changes in interest rates and their impact on nir and balance sheet values. nir simulation is the primary tool used in our evaluation of the potential range of possible nir results that could occur under a variety of interest-rate environments. we also use market valuation and duration analysis to assess changes in the economic value of balance sheet assets and liabilities caused by assumed changes in interest rates.
to measure, monitor, and report on our interest-rate risk position, we use nir simulation, referred to as nir-at-risk, and eve sensitivity. nir-at-risk measures the impact on nir over the next twelve months to immediate, or "rate shock," and gradual, or "rate ramp," changes in market interest rates. eve sensitivity is a total return view of interest-rate risk, which measures the impact on the present value of all nir-related principal and interest cash flows of an immediate change in interest rates. although nir-at-risk and eve sensitivity measure interest-rate risk over different time horizons, both utilize consistent assumptions when modeling the positions currently held by state street; however, nir-at-risk also incorporates future actions planned by management over the time horizons being modeled.
in estimating our nir-at-risk, we start with a base amount of nir that is projected over the next twelve months, assuming our forecast yield curve over the period. our existing balance sheet assets and liabilities are adjusted by the amount and timing of transactions that are forecast to occur over the next twelve months. that yield curve is then "shocked," or moved immediately, +/-100 basis points in a parallel fashion at all points along the yield curve. two new twelve-month nir projections are then developed using the same balance sheet and forecast transactions, but with the new yield curves, and compared to the base scenario. we also perform the calculations using interest-rate ramps, which are +/-100-basis-point changes in interest rates that are assumed to occur gradually over the next twelve months, rather than immediately as we do with interest-rate shocks.
eve is based on the change in the present value of all nir-related principal and interest cash flows for changes in market interest rates. the present value of existing cash flows with a then-current yield curve serves as the base case. we then apply an immediate parallel shock to that yield curve of +/-200 basis points and recalculate the cash flows and related present values. a large shock is used to better capture the embedded option risk in our mortgage-backed securities that results from borrowers' prepayment opportunities.
key assumptions used in the models, described in more detail below, along with changes in market conditions, are inherently uncertain. actual results necessarily differ from model results as market conditions differ from assumptions. as such, management performs back-testing, stress testing, and model integrity analyses to validate that the modeled results produce predictive nir-at-risk and eve sensitivity estimates which can be used in our management of interest-rate risk. primary factors affecting the actual results include changes in our balance sheet size and mix, the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates (including the slope and the relationship between the interest-rate level of u.s. dollar and non-u.s. dollar yield curves), changes in market conditions and management actions taken in response to the preceding conditions.
both nir-at-risk and eve sensitivity results are managed against alco-approved limits and guidelines and are monitored regularly, along with other relevant simulations, scenario analyses and stress tests, by both global treasury and alco. our alco-approved guidelines are, we believe, in line with industry standards and are periodically examined by the federal reserve.
as a result of differences in measurement between nir-at-risk and eve with respect to certain assumptions, such as the reinvestment of our interest-earning assets, reported results of nir-at-risk could present an increase in nir from an increase in rates while eve presents a loss. changes in assumptions may result in different outcomes under both nir-at-risk and eve. nir-at-risk depicts the change in the nominal (un-discounted) dollar net interest flows which are generated from the forecast statement of condition over the next twelve months.  as interest rates increase, the interest expense associated with our client deposit liabilities is assumed to increase at a slower pace than the investment returns derived from our current balance sheet or the associated reinvestment of our interest-earning assets, resulting in an overall increase to nir. eve, on the other hand, measures the present value change of both principal and interest cash flows based on the current period-end balance sheet. as a result, eve does not contemplate reinvestment of our assets associated with a change in the interest-rate environment.
although nir in both nir-at-risk and eve sensitivity is higher in response to increased interest rates, the future principal flows from fixed-rate
102
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
investments are discounted for eve, which results in lower asset values and a corresponding reduction or loss in eve. as noted above, nir-at-risk does not analyze changes in the value of principal cash flows and therefore does not experience the same reduction experienced by eve sensitivity associated with discounting principal cash flows at higher rates.
net interest revenue at risk nir-at-risk is designed to estimate the potential impact of changes in global market interest rates on nir in the short term. the impact of changes in market rates on nir is measured against a baseline nir which encompasses management's expectations regarding the evolving balance sheet volumes and interest rates in the near-term. the goal is to achieve an acceptable level of nir under various interest-rate environments. assumptions regarding levels of client deposits and our ability to price these deposits under various rate environments have a significant impact on the results of the nir simulations. similarly, the timing of cash flows from our investment portfolio, especially option-embedded financial instruments like mortgage-backed securities, and our ability to replace these cash flows in line with management's expectations, can affect the results of nir simulations.
the following table presents the estimated exposure of our nir for the next twelve months, calculated as of the dates indicated, due to an immediate and gradual +/-100-basis-point shift to our internal forecast of global interest rates. we manage our nir sensitivity to limit declines to 15% or less from baseline nir. estimated exposures presented below are dependent on management's assumptions, and do not reflect any additional actions management may undertake in order to mitigate some of the adverse effects of changes in interest rates on our financial performance.

as of december 31, 2015, nir sensitivity to an upward-100-basis-point shock to our internal forecast of global interest rates, increased compared to such sensitivity as of december 31, 2014, on a dollar exposure basis as well as a percentage of twelve-month forecasted base nir, reflecting slower client deposit repricing expectations in the twelve-month forecast horizon beyond december 31, 2015. the benefit to nir of an upward-100-basis-point ramp is less significant than a shock, since interest rates are assumed to increase gradually.
nir sensitivity to a downward-100-basis-point shock to our internal forecast of global interest rates as of december 31, 2015 decreased compared to such sensitivity as of december 31, 2014 on a dollar and percentage basis, primarily due to higher expected deposit charges when rates decline. december 31, 2015 nir-at-risk sensitivities incorporate additional charges on deposits as rates decline to their floors compared to december 31, 2014 nir-at-risk. a downward-100-basis-point shock in global interest rates places pressure on nir due to declining deposit rates, providing limited funding relief on the liability side, while many assets continue to re-price in the lower-rate environment. the adverse impact on projected nir due to a downward-100-basis-point ramp is less significant than a shock since interest rates are assumed to decrease gradually, thereby reducing the level of projected spread compression experienced between assets and liabilities over a twelve-month horizon.
our baseline nir incorporates an expectation that short-term interest rates will begin to rise in anticipation of central bank tightening of current monetary policies. while this rise in rates benefits our baseline nir, it is detrimental to our nir sensitivity to a downward-100-basis-point shock, as rising short-term interest rates allow asset yields to re-price lower in a downward shock scenario than previously, while deposits are still priced close to natural floors.
other important factors which affect the levels of nir are the size and mix of assets carried in our consolidated statement of condition; interest-rate spreads; the slope and interest-rate level of u.s. and non-u.s. dollar yield curves and the relationship between them; the pace of change in global market interest rates; and management actions taken in response to the preceding conditions.
economic value of equity eve sensitivity measures changes in the market value of equity to quantify potential losses to shareholders due to an immediate +/-200-basis-point rate shock compared to current interest-rate levels if the balance sheet were liquidated immediately. management compares the change in eve sensitivity against state street's aggregate tier 1 and tier 2 risk-based capital, calculated in conformity with current applicable regulatory requirements, to evaluate whether the magnitude of the exposure to interest rates is acceptable. generally, a change resulting from a +/-200-basis-point rate shock that is less than 20% of aggregate tier 1 and tier 2 capital is an
103
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
exposure that management deems acceptable. to the extent that we manage changes in eve sensitivity within the 20% threshold, we would seek to take action to remain below the threshold if the magnitude of our exposure to interest rates approached that limit.
similar to nir-at-risk measures, the timing of cash flows affects eve sensitivity, as changes in asset and liability values under different rate scenarios are dependent on when interest and principal payments are received. in contrast to nir simulations, however, eve sensitivity does not incorporate assumptions regarding reinvestment of these cash flows. in addition, our ability to price client deposits has a much smaller impact on eve sensitivity, as eve sensitivity does not consider the ongoing benefit of investing client deposits.
the following table presents estimated eve exposures, calculated as of the dates indicated, assuming an immediate and prolonged shift in global interest rates, the impact of which would be spread over a number of years.

the dollar measure of eve sensitivity exposure to an upward-200-basis-point shock as of december 31, 2015 increased compared to december 31, 2014 while the dollar measure of eve sensitivity to a downward-200-basis-point shock as of december 31, 2015 improved compared to december 31, 2014. the change in both eve sensitivity measures was primarily driven by investment portfolio activity.
eve sensitivity exposure to an upward-200-basis-point shock as of december 31, 2015, as a percentage of the total of tier 1 and tier 2 regulatory capital, increased compared to december 31, 2014. eve sensitivity to a downward-200-basis-point shock as of december 31, 2015, as a percentage of the total of tier 1 and tier 2 regulatory capital, improved compared to december 31, 2014. these shifts were primarily due to the previously mentioned changes in the dollar measures of eve sensitivity.
model risk management the use of quantitative models is widespread throughout the financial services industry, with large and complex organizations relying on sophisticated models to support numerous aspects of their financial decision making. the models contemporaneously represent both a significant advancement in financial management and a new source of risk. in large banking organizations like state street, model results influence business decisions, and model failure could have a harmful effect on our financial performance. as a result, we manage model risk within a model risk management framework.
our model risk management program has three principal components:
•   a model risk governance program that defines roles and responsibilities, including the authority to restrict model usage, provides policies and guidance, monitors compliance, and reports regularly to the board on the overall degree of model risk across the corporation;
•   a model development process that focuses on sound design and computational accuracy, and includes activities designed to test for robustness, stability, and sensitivity to assumptions; and
•   an independent model validation function designed to verify that models are conceptually sound, computationally accurate, are performing as expected, and are in line with their design objectives.
governance models used in the regulatory capital calculation can only be deployed for use after receiving a satisfactory validation review and approval decision from model risk management.
erm's model risk management group is responsible for defining the corporate-wide model risk governance framework, and maintains policies that achieve the framework's objectives. the team is responsible for overall model risk governance capabilities, with particular emphasis in the areas of model validation, model risk reporting, model performance monitoring, tracking of new model development status, and committee-level review and challenge.
mrc, which is composed of senior staff with technical expertise, reports to mrac, and provides guidance and oversight to the model risk management function.
model development and usage models are developed under standards governing data sourcing, methodology selection and model integrity testing. model development includes a statement of purpose to align development with intended use. it also includes a comparison of alternative approaches to promote a sound modeling approach.
104
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
model developers conduct an assessment of data quality and relevance. the development teams conduct a variety of tests of the accuracy, robustness and stability of each model.
model owners submit models to the model validation group for validation on a regular basis, as per existing policy.
model validation mvg is part of model risk management within erm and performs model validations. mvg is independent, as contemplated by applicable bank regulatory requirements, of both the developers and users of the models. mvg validates models through a review process that assesses the appropriateness, accuracy, and suitability of data inputs, methodologies, assumptions, and processing code. model validation also encompasses an assessment of model performance, sensitivity, and robustness, as well as a model's potential limitations given its particular assumptions or deficiencies. based on the results of its review, mvg issues a model use decision and may require remedial actions and compensating controls on model use. mvg also maintains a model risk-rating system, which assigns a risk rating to each model based on an assessment of a model's inherent and residual risks. these ratings aid in the understanding and reporting of model risk across the model portfolio, and enable the triaging of needs for remediation.
although model validation is the primary method of subjecting models to independent review and challenge, in practice, a multi-step governance process provides the opportunity for challenge by multiple parties. first, mvg conducts model validation and issues a model use decision that may be accompanied by mandatory remedial actions and compensating controls. second, these decisions are reviewed, challenged, and confirmed by the mrc. finally, model use decisions, risk ratings, and overall levels of model risk are reported to and reviewed by mrac. mrm also reports regularly on model risk issues to the board.
strategic risk management we define strategic risk as the current or prospective impact on earnings or capital arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of strategic initiatives, or lack of responsiveness to industry-wide changes. strategic risks are influenced by changes in the competitive environment; decline in market performance or changes in our business activities; and the potential secondary impacts of reputational risks, not already captured as market, interest rate, credit, operational, model or liquidity risks. we incorporate strategic risk into our assessment of our business plans and risk and capital management processes. active management of strategic risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business.
separating the effects of a potential material adverse event into operational and strategic risk is sometimes difficult. for instance, the direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss, while the impact on our reputation and consequently the potential loss of clients and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as a strategic risk loss. an additional example of strategic risk is the integration of a major acquisition. failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business, and the resultant inability to retain clients and the associated revenue, would be classified as a loss due to strategic risk.
strategic risk is managed with a long-term focus. techniques for its assessment and management include the development of business plans, which are subject to robust review and challenge from senior management and the board of directors, as well as a formal review and approval process for all new business and product proposals. the potential impact of the various elements of strategic risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision. we use a combination of historical earnings volatility, scenario analysis, stress-testing and management judgment to help assess the potential effect on state street attributable to strategic risk. management and control of strategic risks are generally the responsibility of the business units, with oversight from the control functions, as part of their overall strategic planning and internal risk management processes.
capital managing our capital involves evaluating whether our actual and projected levels of capital are commensurate with our risk profile, are in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, and are sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives. we assess capital adequacy based on relevant regulatory capital requirements, as well as our own internal capital goals, targets and other relevant metrics.
framework our objective with respect to management of our capital is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial flexibility for our business needs, including funding corporate growth and supporting clients' cash management needs, and to provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors. we strive to maintain an appropriate level of capital, commensurate with our risk profile, on which an attractive return to shareholders is expected to be realized over both the short and long term, while
105
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
protecting our obligations to depositors and creditors and complying with regulatory capital requirements.
our capital management focuses on our risk exposures, the regulatory requirements applicable to us with respect to multiple capital measures, the evaluations and resulting credit ratings of the major independent rating agencies, our return on capital at both the consolidated and line-of-business level, and our capital position relative to our peers.
assessment of our overall capital adequacy includes the comparison of capital sources with capital uses, as well as the consideration of the quality and quantity of the various components of capital. the assessment seeks to determine the optimal level of capital and composition of capital instruments to satisfy all constituents of capital, with the lowest overall cost to shareholders. other factors considered in our assessment of capital adequacy are strategic and contingency planning, stress testing and planned capital actions.
capital adequacy process our primary federal banking regulator is the federal reserve. both state street and state street bank are subject to the minimum regulatory capital requirements established by the federal reserve and defined in fdicia. state street bank must exceed the regulatory capital thresholds for "well capitalized" in order for our parent company to maintain its status as a financial holding company. accordingly, one of our primary goals with respect to capital management is to exceed all applicable minimum regulatory capital requirements and to be "well-capitalized" under the pca guidelines established by the fdic. our capital management activities are conducted as part of our corporate-wide cap and associated capital policy and guidelines.
we consider capital adequacy to be a key element of our financial well-being, which affects our ability to attract and maintain client relationships; operate effectively in the global capital markets; and satisfy regulatory, security holder and shareholder needs. capital is one of several elements that affect our credit ratings and the ratings of our principal subsidiaries.
in conformity with our capital policy and guidelines, we strive to achieve and maintain specific internal capital levels, not just at a point in time, but over time and during periods of stress, to account for changes in our strategic direction, evolving economic conditions, and financial and market volatility. we have developed and implemented a corporate-wide cap to assess our overall capital in relation to our risk profile and to provide a comprehensive strategy for maintaining appropriate capital levels. the cap considers material risks under multiple scenarios, with an emphasis on stress scenarios, and encompasses existing processes and systems used to measure our capital adequacy.
capital contingency planning contingency planning is an integral component of capital management. the objective of contingency planning is to monitor current and forecast levels of select capital, liquidity and other measures that serve as early indicators of a potentially adverse capital or liquidity adequacy situation. these measures are one of the inputs used to set our internal capital adequacy level. we review these measures annually for appropriateness and relevance in relation to our financial budget and capital plan.
stress testing we administer a robust state street-wide stress-testing program that executes multiple stress tests each year to assess the institution's capital adequacy and/or future performance under adverse conditions. our stress testing program is structured around what we determine to be the key risks incurred by state street, as assessed through a recurring material risk identification process. the material risk identification process represents a bottom-up approach to identifying the institution's most significant risk exposures across all on- and off-balance sheet risk-taking activities, including credit, market, liquidity, interest rate, operational, fiduciary, business, reputation, and regulatory risks. these key risks serve as an organizing principle for much of our risk management framework, as well as reporting, including the "risk dashboard" provided to the board. over the past few years, stress scenarios have included a deep recession in the u.s., a break-up of the eurozone, a severe recession in china and an oil shock precipitated by turmoil in the middle east/north africa region.
in connection with the focus on our key risks, each stress test incorporates idiosyncratic loss events tailored to state street's unique risk profile and business activities. due to the nature of our business model and our consolidated statement of condition, our risks differ from those of a traditional commercial bank.
the federal reserve requires bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, which includes state street, to submit a capital plan on an annual basis. the federal reserve uses its annual ccar process, which incorporates hypothetical financial and economic stress scenarios, to review those capital plans and assess whether banking organizations have capital planning processes that account for idiosyncratic
106
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
risks and provide for sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress. as part of its ccar process, the federal reserve assesses each organization's capital adequacy, capital planning process, and plans to distribute capital, such as dividend payments or stock purchase programs. management and board risk committees review, challenge, and approve ccar results and assumptions before submission to the federal reserve.
through the evaluation of state street's capital adequacy and/or future performance under adverse conditions, the stress testing processes provide important insights for capital planning, risk management, and strategic decision-making at state street.
governance in order to support integrated decision making, we have identified three management elements to aid in the compatibility and coordination of our cap:
•   risk management - identification, measurement, monitoring and forecasting of different types of risk and their combined impact on capital adequacy;
•   capital management - determination of optimal capital levels; and
•   business management - strategic planning, budgeting, forecasting, and performance management.
we have a hierarchical structure supporting appropriate committee review of relevant risk and capital information. the ongoing responsibility for capital management rests with our treasurer. the capital planning group within global treasury is responsible for the capital policy and guidelines, development of the capital plan, the management of global capital, capital optimization, and business unit capital management.
mrac provides oversight of our capital management, our capital adequacy, our internal targets and the expectations of the major independent credit rating agencies. in addition, mrac approves our balance sheet strategy and related activities. the board's rc assists the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities related to the assessment and management of risk and capital. our capital policy is reviewed and approved annually by the board's rc.
regulatory capital we and our depository institution subsidiaries are subject to the current u.s. basel iii minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratio guidelines. the basel iii final rule incorporates several multi-year transition provisions for capital components and minimum ratio requirements for common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital. the transition period started in january 2014 and will be completed by january 1, 2019 which is concurrent with the full implementation of the basel iii final rule in the u.s. see "supervision and regulation" included under item 1, "business" of this form 10-k for discussion of our capital and liquidity ratios, including minimum ratios we are required to maintain.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
the specific calculation of state street's and state street bank's risk-based capital ratios will change as the provisions of the basel iii final rule related to the numerator (capital) and denominator (risk-weighted assets) are phased in, and as our risk-weighted assets calculated using the advanced approaches change due to potential changes in methodology. these ongoing methodological changes will result in differences in our reported capital ratios from one reporting period to the next that are independent of applicable changes to our capital base, our asset composition, our off-balance sheet exposures or our risk profile.

(1) common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital ratios as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 were calculated in conformity with the advanced approaches provisions of the basel iii final rule. tier 1 leverage ratio as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014 were calculated in conformity with the basel iii final rule.
(2) common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital ratios as of december 31, 2015 were calculated in conformity with the standardized approach provisions of the basel iii final rule. tier 1 leverage ratio as of december 31, 2015 was calculated in conformity with the basel iii final rule.
(3) common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital, total capital and tier 1 leverage ratios as of december 31, 2014 were calculated in conformity with the transitional provisions of the basel iii final rule. specifically, these ratios reflect common equity tier 1, tier 1 and total capital (the numerator) calculated in conformity with the provisions of the basel iii final rule, and total risk-weighted assets or, with respect to the tier 1 leverage ratio, quarterly average assets (in both cases, the denominator), calculated in conformity with the provisions of basel i.
(4) amounts for state street and state street bank as of december 31, 2015 consisted of goodwill, net of associated deferred tax liabilities, and 40% of other intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities.  amounts for state street and state street bank as of december 31, 2014 consisted of goodwill, net of deferred tax liabilities and 20% of other intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities. intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities is phased in as a deduction from capital, in conformity with the basel iii final rule.
(5)  market risk risk-weighted assets reported in conformity with the basel iii advanced approaches included a cva which reflected the risk of potential fair-value adjustments for credit risk reflected in our valuation of over-the-counter derivative contracts.  the cva was not provided for in the final market risk capital rule; however, it was required by the advanced approaches provisions of the basel iii final rule.  state street used the simple cva approach in conformity with the basel iii advanced approaches.
(6) minimum requirements will be phased in up to full implementation beginning on january 1, 2019; minimum requirements listed are as of december 31, 2015. see table 43: basel iii final rules transition arrangements and minimum risk based capital ratios.
(7) minimum requirements will be phased in up to full implementation beginning on january 1, 2019; minimum requirements listed are as of december 31, 2014. see table 43: basel iii final rules transition arrangements and minimum risk based capital ratios.
(8) amounts for 2014 reflect adjustments related to certain expenses billed to our asset servicing clients as more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
the regulatory capital ratios for state street and state street bank as of december 31, 2015, presented in table 44: regulatory capital structure and related regulatory capital ratios, differ from such ratios as of december 31, 2014 for reasons beyond changes to our capital base, our asset composition, our off-balance sheet exposures or our risk profile. the december 31, 2015 ratios reflect a different set of methodologies required by applicable regulators to calculate capital and total risk-weighted assets from those utilized to calculate the december 31, 2014 ratios. as a result, the ratios presented in the table for each period are not directly comparable.
as of january 1, 2015 we used the standardized provisions of the basel iii final rule in addition to the advanced approaches provisions which were previously implemented in the second quarter of 2014, and the lower of our regulatory capital ratios calculated under the advanced approaches and those ratios calculated under the standardized approach are applied in the assessment of our capital adequacy for regulatory capital purposes. beginning in the second quarter of 2014, until january 1, 2015, we used the advanced approaches provisions in the basel iii final rule, and transitional provisions of the basel iii final rule, and the lower of our regulatory capital ratios calculated under the advanced approaches and those ratios calculated under the transitional provisions were applied in the assessment of our capital adequacy for regulatory capital purposes. prior to the second quarter of 2014, we used the provisions of basel i to calculate our risk-weighted assets.
state street's common equity tier 1 capital decreased $894 million as of december 31, 2015 compared to december 31, 2014, as a result of purchases by us of our common stock of approximately $1.52 billion, declarations of common and preferred stock dividends of $666 million, the strengthening u.s. dollar's effect on accumulated other comprehensive income, and the impact of the phase-in provisions of the basel iii final rule related to other intangible assets, partially offset by the positive effect of year-to-date net income. over the same period, state street's tier 1 capital decreased $354 million, total capital decreased $366 million under advanced approaches and total capital decreased $312 million under standardized approach. our tier 1 capital and total capital decreased by less than common equity tier 1 capital over the same period, as the net decrease to common equity tier 1 capital was largely offset by the positive effects on tier 1 capital and total capital of the issuance of $750 million of preferred stock in the second quarter of 2015. state street bank's tier 1 capital increased $750 million, and total capital increased $495 million and $553 million under the advanced and standardized approaches, respectively, as of december 31, 2015, compared to december 31, 2014, the result of year-to-date net income, partially offset by the previously-described impact to accumulated other comprehensive income and phase-in provisions of the basel iii final rule related to other intangible assets.

as of december 31, 2015, total advanced approaches risk-weighted assets decreased $8.28 billion compared to december 31, 2014, primarily the result of a reduction in credit risk due to sales, maturities and pay-downs of the securitized investment portfolio and the subsequent reinvestment in hqla, a decrease associated with the usage of the alternative modified look through approach for investments in investment funds, and a decline in over the counter foreign exchange derivatives mainly due to a decrease in volumes and the addition of new netting agreements. the decreases were partially offset by an $8.02 billion increase in operational risk which reflects adjustments to the model inputs.
as of december 31, 2014, total risk-weighted assets decreased from june 30, 2014 balances primarily due to lower credit risk-weighted assets, partially offset by an increase in market risk-equivalent risk-weighted assets. the increase in market risk-equivalent risk weighted assets resulted from the increase in the sixty-day moving average of our stressed var-based measure. our stressed

var-based measure was impacted by the extension of the tenor of fx swaps by global treasury designed to improve our liquidity position. the decrease in credit risk-weighted assets primarily related to sales, maturities and pay-downs of both wholesale and securitized investments, partially offset by an increase in loan activity.

as of december 31, 2015, total standardized approach risk-weighted assets decreased $29.12 billion compared to december 31, 2014, primarily the result of a reduction in credit risk due to sales, maturities and pay-downs of both securitized and wholesale investment portfolio and the subsequent reinvestment in hqla, a decrease in securities financing exposure, a decrease associated with the usage of the alternative modified look through approach for investments in investment funds and a decline in over the counter foreign exchange derivatives primarily due to a decrease in volumes and the addition of new netting agreements.
the regulatory capital ratios as of december 31, 2015, presented in table 44: regulatory capital structure and related regulatory capital ratios, are calculated under the standardized approach and advanced approaches in conformity with the basel iii final rule. the advanced approaches-based ratios
(actual and estimated pro forma) reflect calculations and determinations with respect to our capital and related matters as of december 31, 2015, based on state street and external data, quantitative formulae, statistical models, historical correlations and assumptions, collectively referred to as "advanced systems," in effect and used by state street for those purposes as of the time we first reported such ratios in a quarterly report on form 10-q. significant components of these advanced systems involve the exercise of judgment by us and our regulators, and our advanced systems may not, individually or collectively, precisely represent or calculate the scenarios, circumstances, outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended.
due to the influence of changes in these advanced systems, whether resulting from changes in data inputs, regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation, state street-specific or market activities or experiences or other updates or factors, we expect that our advanced systems and our capital ratios calculated in conformity with the basel iii final rule will change and may be volatile over time, and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period to period. models implemented under the basel iii final rule, particularly those implementing the advanced approaches, remain subject to regulatory review and approval. the full effects of the basel iii final rule on state street and state street bank are therefore subject to further evaluation and also to further regulatory guidance, action or rule-making.
estimated basel iii fully phased-in capital ratios table 48: regulatory capital structure and related regulatory capital ratios - state street and table 49: regulatory capital structure and related regulatory capital ratios - state street bank present our capital ratios for state street and state street bank as of december 31, 2015, calculated in conformity with the advanced approaches provisions and standardized approach of the basel iii final rule on an estimated, pro forma basis under the fully phased-in provisions of the basel iii final rule. pro forma fully phased-in capital ratios calculated in accordance with both approaches as of december 31, 2015, are preliminary estimates, based on our present interpretations of the basel iii final rule as applied to our businesses and operations as of december 31, 2015.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
fully phased-in pro-forma estimates of common shareholders' equity include 100% of accumulated other comprehensive income, including accumulated other comprehensive income attributable to available-for-sale securities, cash flow hedges and defined benefit pension plans. fully phased-in pro-forma estimates of common equity tier 1 capital reflect 100% of applicable deductions, including but not limited to, intangible assets net of deferred tax liabilities. as of december 31, 2015, tier 1 capital includes 25% of trust preferred capital securities and the remaining 75% is included in tier 2 capital. fully phased-in tier 1 capital reflects the transition of trust preferred capital securities from tier 1 capital to tier 2 capital. for both basel iii advanced and standardized approaches, fully phased-in pro-forma estimates of risk-weighted assets reflect the exclusion of intangible assets, offset by additions related to non-significant equity exposures and deferred tax assets related to temporary differences.
global systemically important bank we are designated as a large bank holding company subject to enhanced supervision and prudential standards, commonly referred to as a "systemically important financial institution," or sifi, and we are one among a group of 30 institutions worldwide that have been identified by the fsb and the bcbs as g-sibs. our designation as a g-sib will require us to maintain an additional capital buffer above the basel iii final rule minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, based on a number of factors, as evaluated by banking regulators. see further discussion of the g-sib surcharge within "supervision and regulation" included under item 1, "business" of this form 10-k.

federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company. in addition, banking regulators have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends. information concerning limitations on dividends from our subsidiary banks is provided in "related stockholder matters" included under item 5, and in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
stock purchases may be made using various types of mechanisms, including open market purchases or transactions off market, and may be made under rule 10b5-1 trading programs. the timing of stock purchases, types of transactions and number of shares purchased will depend on several factors, including, market conditions and state street's capital positions, its financial performance and investment opportunities. the common stock purchase program does not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time.

116
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. though these transactions are collateralized, the substantial volume of these activities necessitates detailed credit-based underwriting and monitoring processes. the aggregate amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled $320.44 billion as of december 31, 2015, compared to $349.77 billion as of december 31, 2014. we require the borrower to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the fair market value of the securities borrowed. we hold the collateral received in connection with these securities lending services as agent, and the collateral is not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. we revalue the securities on loan and the collateral daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary or if excess collateral is required to be returned to the borrower. we held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $335.42 billion and $364.41 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively.
the cash collateral held by us as agent is invested on behalf of our clients. in certain cases, the cash collateral is invested in third-party repurchase agreements, for which we indemnify the client against loss of the principal invested. we require the counterparty to the indemnified repurchase agreement to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the amount of the repurchase agreement. in our role as agent, the indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral held by us are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. of the collateral of $335.42 billion and $364.41 billion, referenced above, $63.06 billion and $85.31 billion was invested in indemnified repurchase agreements as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively. we or our agents held $67.02 billion and $90.82 billion as collateral for indemnified investments in repurchase agreements as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively.
additional information about our securities finance activities and other off-balance sheet arrangements is provided in notes 10 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
significant accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap, and we apply accounting policies that affect the determination of amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. additional information on our significant accounting policies, including references to applicable footnotes, is provided in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
certain of our accounting policies, by their nature, require management to make judgments, involving significant estimates and assumptions, about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. these estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and changes in this information over time could materially affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements.
based on the sensitivity of reported financial statement amounts to the underlying estimates and assumptions, the more significant accounting policies applied by state street have been identified by management as those associated with recurring fair-value measurements, otti of investment securities, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, and contingencies. these accounting policies require the most subjective or complex judgments, and underlying estimates and assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. an understanding of the judgments, estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential in order to understand our reported consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
the following is a discussion of the above-mentioned significant accounting estimates. management has discussed these significant accounting estimates with the e&a committee of the board.
fair-value measurements we carry certain of our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, including trading account assets, afs investment securities and derivative instruments.
changes in the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities are recorded either as components of our consolidated statement of income, or as components of other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity in our consolidated
117

statement of condition. in addition to those financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, we estimate the fair values of other financial assets and liabilities that we carry at amortized cost in our consolidated statement of condition, and we disclose these fair value estimates in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. we estimate the fair values of these financial assets and liabilities using the definition of fair value described below.
as of december 31, 2015, approximately $75.70 billion of our financial assets and approximately $4.23 billion of our financial liabilities were carried at fair value on a recurring basis, compared to $103.77 billion and $6.31 billion, respectively, as of december 31, 2014. the amounts as of december 31, 2015 represented approximately 31% of our consolidated total assets and approximately 2% of our consolidated total liabilities, compared to 38% and 2%, respectively, as of december 31, 2014. the decrease in the relative percentage of consolidated total assets as of december 31, 2015 compared to 2014 mainly reflects a decline in the investment securities portfolio, associated with a lower level of purchases in 2015 compared to 2014, and an increase in interest-bearing deposits with banks, the result of the continued elevated level of client deposits. additional information with respect to the assets and liabilities carried by us at fair value on a recurring basis is provided in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
u.s. gaap defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. when we measure fair value for our financial assets and liabilities, we consider the principal or the most advantageous market in which we would transact; we also consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. when possible, we look to active and observable markets to measure the fair value of identical, or similar, financial assets and liabilities. when identical financial assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets, we look to market-observable data for similar assets and liabilities. in some instances, certain assets and liabilities are not actively traded in observable markets; as a result, we use alternate valuation techniques to measure their fair value.
we categorize the financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition on a recurring basis based on u.s. gaap's prescribed three-level valuation hierarchy. the hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to valuation methods using significant unobservable inputs (level 3).
as of december 31, 2015, including the effect of netting, we categorized approximately 8% of our financial assets carried at fair value in level 1, approximately 89% of our financial assets carried at fair value in level 2, and approximately 3% of our financial assets carried at fair value in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. as of december 31, 2014, including the effect of netting, we categorized less than 10% of our financial assets carried at fair value in level 1, approximately 85% of our financial assets carried at fair value in level 2, and approximately 5% of our financial assets carried at fair value in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
as of december 31, 2015, on the same basis, we categorized approximately 2% of our financial liabilities carried at fair value in level 1, approximately 98% of our financial liabilities carried at fair value in level 2, and less than 1% of our financial liabilities carried at fair value in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. as of december 31, 2014, on the same basis, we had no financial liabilities carried at fair value in level 1, we categorized approximately 99% of our financial liabilities carried at fair value in level 2, and less than 1% of our financial liabilities carried at fair value in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
the assets categorized in level 1 were primarily trading account assets. fair value for these securities was measured by management using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.
the assets categorized in level 2 were primarily afs investment securities and derivative instruments. fair value for the investment securities was measured by management primarily using information obtained from independent third parties. information obtained from third parties is subject to review by management as part of a validation process. management utilizes a process to verify the information provided, including an understanding of underlying assumptions and the level of market-participant information used to support those assumptions. in addition, management compares significant assumptions used by third parties to available market information. such information may include known trades or, to the extent that trading activity is limited, comparisons to market research information pertaining to credit expectations,
118
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
execution prices and the timing of cash flows and, where information is available, back-testing.
the derivative instruments categorized in level 2 primarily comprised of foreign exchange and interest-rate contracts used in our trading activities, for which fair value was measured by management using discounted cash flow techniques, with inputs consisting of observable spot and forward points, as well as observable interest rate curves.
the substantial majority of our financial assets categorized in level 3 were asset-backed and mortgage-backed afs securities. level-3 assets also included foreign exchange derivative contracts. the aggregate fair value of our financial assets and liabilities categorized in level 3 as of december 31, 2015 decreased approximately 55% compared to 2014, primarily the result of transfers out of level 3 and paydowns of asset-backed and non-u.s. debt securities.
with respect to derivative instruments, we evaluated the impact on valuation of the credit risk of our counterparties and of our own credit. we considered such factors as the market-based probability of default by us and our counterparties, and our current and expected potential future net exposures by remaining maturities, in determining the appropriate measurements of fair value. valuation adjustments associated with derivative instruments were not significant to our consolidated financial performance in 2015, 2014 or 2013.
other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities our portfolio of fixed-income investment securities constitutes a significant portion of the assets carried in our consolidated statement of condition. u.s. gaap requires the use of expected future cash flows to evaluate otti of these investment securities. the amount and timing of these expected future cash flows are significant estimates used in our evaluation of otti. an otti is triggered if the intent is to sell the security or the security will more likely than not have to be sold before the amortized cost basis is recovered. additional information with respect to management's assessment of otti is provided in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
expectations of defaults and prepayments are the most significant assumptions underlying our estimates of future cash flows. in determining these estimates, management relies on relevant and reliable information, including but not limited to deal structure, including optional and mandatory calls, market interest-rate curves, industry standard asset-
class-specific prepayment models, recent prepayment history, independent credit ratings, and recent actual and projected credit losses. management considers this information based on its relevance and uses its best judgment in order to determine its assumptions for underlying cash-flow expectations and resulting estimates. management reviews its underlying assumptions and develops expected future cash-flow estimates at least quarterly. additional detail with respect to the sensitivity of these default and prepayment assumptions is provided under "financial condition - investment securities" in management's discussion and analysis.
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired. other intangible assets represent purchased assets that can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual rights or because the asset can be exchanged on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. goodwill is not amortized, while other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
goodwill is ultimately supported by revenue from our investment servicing and investment management lines of business. a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth, or our inability to deliver cost-effective services over sustained periods, could lead to a perceived impairment of goodwill, which would be evaluated and, if necessary, be recorded as a write-down of the reported amount of goodwill through a charge to other expenses in our consolidated statement of income.
on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances arise, management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may indicate impairment of the carrying amount. we perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our two major lines of business. the evaluation methodology for potential impairment is inherently complex and involves significant management judgment in the use of estimates and assumptions.
we evaluate goodwill for impairment using a two-step process. first, we compare the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, no impairment exists. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, then we compare the "implied" fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying amount. if the

carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, then goodwill impairment is recognized by writing the goodwill down to the implied fair value. the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, as if the unit had been acquired in a business combination and the overall fair value of the unit was the purchase price.
to determine the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit being evaluated for goodwill impairment, we use one of two principal methodologies: a market approach, based on a comparison of the reporting unit to publicly-traded companies in similar lines of business; or an income approach, based on the value of the cash flows that the business can be expected to generate in the future.
events that may indicate impairment include significant or adverse changes in the business, economic or political climate; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; and a more-likely-than-not expectation that we will sell or otherwise dispose of a business to which the goodwill or other intangible assets relate. additional information about goodwill and other intangible assets, including information by line of business, is provided in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this form 10-k.
our evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets indicated that no significant impairment occurred in 2015, 2014 or 2013. goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in our consolidated statement of condition as of december 31, 2015 totaled approximately $5.67 billion and $1.77 billion, respectively, compared to $5.83 billion and $2.03 billion, respectively, as of december 31, 2014.

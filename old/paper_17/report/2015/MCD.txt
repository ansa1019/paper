item 1a. risk factors and cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements the information in this report includes forward-looking statements about future events and circumstances and their effects upon revenues, expenses and business opportunities. generally speaking, any statement in this report not based upon historical fact is a forward-looking statement. forward-looking statements can also be identified by the use of forward-looking words, such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe" and "plan" or similar expressions. in particular, statements regarding our plans, strategies, prospects and expectations regarding our business and industry are forward-looking statements. they reflect our expectations, are not guarantees of performance and speak only as of the date of this report. except as required by law, we do not undertake to update them. our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements. our business results are subject to a variety of risks, including those that are reflected in the following considerations and factors, as well as elsewhere in our filings with the sec. if any of these considerations or risks materialize, our expectations may change and our performance may be adversely affected.
if we do not successfully design and execute our business strategies, we may not be able to increase revenues or market share.
to drive future results, our business strategies must be effective in achieving market share gains while at the same time delivering operating income growth. whether we successfully execute these strategies depends mainly on our system's ability to:
▪   continue to innovate and differentiate in all aspects of the mcdonald's experience in a way that balances value to our customers with profitability;
▪   reinvest in our restaurants and identify and develop restaurant sites consistent with our system's plans for net growth of system-wide restaurants;
▪   provide clean and friendly environments that deliver a consistent mcdonald's experience and demonstrate high service levels;
▪   drive restaurant improvements that achieve optimal capacity, particularly during peak mealtime hours; and
▪   manage the complexity of our restaurant operations.
if we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies, or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.
the implementation of our turnaround plan may intensify the risks we face and may not be successful in driving improved performance.
our turnaround plan includes restructuring market segments, optimizing restaurant ownership mix through accelerated refranchising, delivering cost savings and enhancing financial value through increased leverage. implementing those actions will intensify the existing risks we face in our business, including risks associated with franchising and risks associated with our credit ratings. further, if those actions are not successful, take longer to complete than initially projected, or are not executed effectively, our business operations, financial results and results of operations could be adversely affected.
we face intense competition in our markets, which could hurt our business.
we compete primarily in the "informal eating out" (ieo) segment, which is highly competitive. we are facing sustained, intense competition from both traditional and other competitors, which include many non-traditional market participants such as convenience stores and coffee shops. in addition, in recent periods we have experienced emerging and growing competition from the fast casual category of restaurants. we expect our environment to continue to be highly competitive and in any particular reporting period our results may be impacted by new actions of our competitors, which may have a short- or long-term impact on our results.
we compete on the basis of product choice, quality, affordability, service and location. in particular, we believe our ability to compete successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products, develop new products, price our products appropriately, manage the complexity of our restaurant operations and respond effectively to our mcdonald's corporation 2015 annual report 3
competitors' actions. recognizing these dependencies, we have intensified our focus in recent periods on strategies to achieve these goals, including the turnaround plan described above, and we will likely continue to modify our strategies and implement new strategies in the future. there can be no assurance these strategies will be effective, and some strategies may be effective at improving some metrics while adversely affecting other metrics.
if we do not anticipate and address evolving consumer preferences, our business could suffer.
our continued success depends on our system's ability to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics, trends in food sourcing, food preparation and consumer preferences in the ieo segment. we must continuously adapt to deliver a relevant experience for our customers amidst a highly competitive, value-driven operating environment. we continue to implement initiatives to address these shifts at an aggressive pace. there is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful and, if they are not, our financial results could be adversely impacted.
if our pricing, promotional and marketing plans are not effective, our results may be negatively impacted.
our results depend on the impact of our pricing, promotional and marketing plans and our system's ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly to economic and competitive conditions. our existing or future pricing strategies and the value proposition they represent will continue to be important components of our overall plan, may not be successful and could negatively impact sales and margins. the promotion of our menu offerings may yield results below desired levels.
additionally, we operate in an increasingly complex and costly advertising environment. our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful and we may fail to attract and retain customers. we have increased our emphasis on digital offerings and customer loyalty initiatives, and our success depends in part on whether we can effectively execute such offerings and initiatives in a way that will enhance customer engagement. if our pricing, promotional and marketing plans are not successful, or are not as successful as those of our competitors, our sales, guest counts and market share could decrease.
failure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have a negative impact on our financial results.
to be successful in the future, we believe we must preserve, enhance and leverage the value of our brand. brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of our food, our business practices and the manner in which we source the commodities we use. consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons. for example, nutritional, health and other scientific studies and conclusions, which constantly evolve and often have contradictory implications, drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that affect the ieo segment or perceptions of our brand and could be material to our business. perceptions may also be affected by third parties presenting or promoting adverse commentary or perceptions of the quick-service category of the ieo segment, our brand and/or our operations, our suppliers or our franchisees. if we are unsuccessful in addressing such adverse commentary or perceptions, our brand and our financial results may suffer.
additionally, the ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on the success of our sustainability initiatives to support our brand ambition of good food, good people and good neighbor, which will require system-wide coordination and alignment. if we are not effective in achieving our stated sustainability goals and addressing these and other matters of social responsibility in a way that inspires trust and confidence, trust in our brand could suffer. in particular, business incidents that erode consumer trust, particularly if such incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation, can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results.
unfavorable general economic conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results.
our results of operations are substantially affected by economic conditions, which can vary significantly by market and can impact consumer disposable income levels and spending habits. economic conditions can also be impacted by a variety of factors including hostilities, epidemics and actions taken by governments to manage national economic matters, whether through austerity or stimulus measures and initiatives intended to control wages, unemployment, credit availability, inflation, taxation and other economic drivers. many major economies, both advanced and developing, continue to face weak economies, high unemployment rates and other ongoing economic issues. continued adverse economic conditions or adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets could pressure our operating performance, and our business and financial results may suffer.
supply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues.
we depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient product supply, including on favorable terms. the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world. supply chain interruptions, including due to lack of supply or price increases, can adversely affect us or the suppliers and franchisees that are also part of our system and whose performance has a significant impact on our results. such shortages or disruptions could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers or us, including inclement weather, natural disasters, increased demand, problems in production or distribution, disruptions in third party logistics or transportation systems, the inability of our suppliers to obtain credit, or food safety warnings or advisories. if we experience interruptions in our supply chain, our costs could increase and it could limit the availability of products critical to our operations.
food safety concerns may have an adverse effect on our business.
our ability to increase sales and profits depends on our system's ability to meet expectations for safe food and on our ability to manage the potential impact on mcdonald's of food-borne illnesses and food or product safety issues that may arise in the future. food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe food products. however, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness, have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future. in 2014, food quality issues were discovered at a supplier to mcdonald's and other food companies in china. as a consequence of this issue, results in china, japan and certain other markets were negatively impacted due to lost sales and profitability, including expenses associated with rebuilding customer trust. any future instances of food tampering, food contamination or food-borne illness, whether actual or perceived, could adversely affect our brand and reputation as well as our revenues and profits.
our franchise business model presents a number of risks.
our success relies in part on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, yet we have limited influence over their operations. our restaurant margins arise from two sources:
4 mcdonald's corporation 2015 annual report company-operated restaurants and franchised restaurants. our franchisees manage their businesses independently, and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their restaurants. the revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales. our franchisees may not experience sales growth, and our revenues and margins could be negatively affected as a result. if sales trends worsen for franchisees, their financial results may deteriorate, which could result in, among other things, restaurant closures or delayed or reduced payments to us. our refranchising effort will increase that dependence and the effect of those factors.
our success also depends on the willingness and ability of our independent franchisees to implement major initiatives, which may include financial investment, and to remain aligned with us on operating, promotional and capital-intensive reinvestment plans. the ability of our franchisees to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general or by the creditworthiness of our franchisees or the company. our operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project a brand image inconsistent with our values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subject to litigation. if franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards, the brand's image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.
our ownership mix also affects our results and financial condition. the decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex and changing. our ability to achieve the benefits of our refranchising strategy, which involves a shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants, in a timely manner or at all, will depend on various factors, including our ability to timely and effectively identify franchisees that meet our rigorous standards, the performance of our existing franchisees, whether the resulting ownership mix supports our financial objectives and our ability to manage risks associated with our refranchising strategy.
changes in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations.
the profitability of our company-operated restaurants depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs, including food, paper, supply, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs. any volatility in certain commodity prices could adversely affect our operating results by impacting restaurant profitability. the commodity market for some of the ingredients we use, such as beef and chicken, is particularly volatile and is subject to significant price fluctuations due to seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand, international commodity markets, food safety concerns, product recalls, government regulation and other factors, all of which are beyond our control and, in many instances, unpredictable. we can only partially address future price risk through hedging and other activities, and therefore increases in commodity costs could have an adverse impact on our profitability.
the global scope of our business subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business.
we face differing cultural, regulatory and economic environments that exist within and among the more than 100 countries where mcdonald's restaurants operate, and our ability to achieve our business objectives depends on our success in these environments. meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment, and our global success is partially dependent on our system's ability to leverage operating successes across markets. our initiatives may not have broad appeal with our customer base and could drive unanticipated changes in customer perceptions and guest counts.
disruptions in our operations or price volatility in a market can also result from governmental actions, such as price, foreign exchange or import-export controls, increased tariffs, government-mandated closure of our or our suppliers' operations and asset seizures. the cost and disruption of responding to governmental investigations or actions, whether or not they have merit, may impact our results. our international success depends in part on the effectiveness of our strategies and brand-building initiatives to reduce our exposure to such governmental actions. our results of operations and financial condition are also affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect reported earnings.
additionally, we face challenges and uncertainties associated with operating in developing markets, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest. such challenges are exacerbated in many cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment. if we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with our international operations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
challenges with respect to talent management could harm our business.
our success depends in part on our system's ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel to work in our restaurants. increased costs associated with recruiting and retaining such qualified personnel, whether because of the trend toward higher statutory minimum wages and social expenses or because of voluntary increases in wages necessitated by labor market conditions, could have a negative impact on the margins of our company-operated restaurants. additionally, economic action, such as boycotts, protests, work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations, could adversely affect (including the ability to recruit and retain talent) us or the franchisees and suppliers that are also part of the mcdonald's system and whose performance may have a material impact on our results.
we are also impacted by the costs and other effects of compliance with u.s. and international regulations affecting our workforce, which includes our staff and employees working in our company-operated restaurants. these regulations are increasingly focused on employment issues including wage and hour, healthcare, immigration, retirement and other employee benefits and unlawful workplace discrimination. our potential exposure to reputational and other harm regarding our workplace practices or conditions or those of our independent franchisees or suppliers (or perceptions thereof) could have a negative impact on our business.
information technology system failures or interruptions or breaches of network security may interrupt our operations.
we are increasingly reliant on technological systems (e.g., point-of-sale and other in-store systems or platforms) to conduct our business, including technology-enabled solutions provided to us by third parties; and any failure of these systems could significantly impact our operations and customer perceptions. despite the implementation of security measures, those technology systems and solutions could become vulnerable to damage, disability or failures due to theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. the third mcdonald's corporation 2015 annual report 5
party solutions also present the risks faced by the third party's business. if those systems or solutions were to fail or otherwise be unavailable, and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we could experience an interruption in our operations. we may also not fully realize the benefits of the significant investments we are making to enhance the customer experience through digital engagement and social media. furthermore, security breaches involving our systems or those of third party providers may occur, such as unauthorized access, denial of service, computer viruses and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. our information technology systems contain personal, financial and other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees as well as financial, proprietary and other confidential information related to our business. an actual or alleged security breach could result in system disruptions, shutdowns, theft or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. the occurrence of any of these incidents could result in adverse publicity, loss of consumer confidence, reduced sales and profits, and criminal penalties or civil liabilities.
increasing regulatory complexity may adversely affect restaurant operations and our financial results.
our regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance and similar risks that could affect our operations and results in material ways. in many of our markets, including the united states and countries in europe, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has increased our cost of doing business. we are affected by the cost, compliance and other risks associated with the often conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations we face, including where inconsistent standards imposed by multiple governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.
our success depends in part on our ability to manage the impact of new, potential or changing regulations that can affect our business plans. these regulations may relate to, among others, product packaging, marketing and the nutritional content and safety of our food and other products, labeling and other disclosure practices, ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants, and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from third-party suppliers (particularly given varying requirements and practices for testing and disclosure).
additionally, we are keenly aware of and working to manage the risks and costs to us, our franchisees and our supply chain of the effects of climate change, greenhouse gases, energy and water resources. the increased public focus, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, on these and other environmental sustainability matters (e.g., packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use) and the increased pressure to make commitments, set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them, could expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks. if we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with our complex regulatory environment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
we are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us.
increasing legal complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways. we could be subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business, including class actions, administrative proceedings, government investigations, employment and personal injury claims, landlord/tenant disputes, disputes with current or former suppliers, claims by current or former franchisees, and intellectual property claims (including claims that we infringed another party's trademarks, copyrights, or patents). inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation.
litigation involving our relationship with franchisees and the legal distinction between our franchisees and us for employment law purposes, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact the business prospects of our franchisees and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. similarly, although our commercial relationships with our suppliers remain independent, there may be attempts to challenge that independence, which, if determined adversely, could also increase costs, negatively impact the business prospects of our suppliers, and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. we are also subject to the legal and compliance risks associated with privacy, data collection, protection and management, in particular as it relates to information we collect when we provide optional technology-related services to franchisees.
our operating results could also be affected by the following:
▪   the relative level of our defense costs, which vary from period to period depending on the number, nature and procedural status of pending proceedings;
▪   the cost and other effects of settlements, judgments or consent decrees, which may require us to make disclosures or take other actions that may affect perceptions of our brand and products;
▪   adverse results of pending or future litigation, including litigation challenging the composition and preparation of our products, or the appropriateness or accuracy of our marketing or other communication practices; and
▪   the scope and terms of insurance or indemnification protections that we may have.
a judgment significantly in excess of any applicable insurance coverage could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. further, adverse publicity resulting from these claims may hurt our business.
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others, which could harm the value of the mcdonald's brand and our business.
the success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. we rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products. we also license our intellectual property to franchisees and other third parties and we cannot assure you that they will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property.
we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions. the trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the united states in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries. the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the united states and foreign countries may not be adequate. in addition, the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. in particular, we may be involved in intellectual property claims, including often aggressive or opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems, which might affect our operations and results. any claim of infringement, whether or not it has merit, could be
6 mcdonald's corporation 2015 annual report time-consuming, could result in costly litigation and could harm our business.
changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability.
we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and foreign jurisdictions, and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world. in particular, we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or related authoritative interpretations, particularly if corporate tax reform becomes a key component of budgetary initiatives in the united states and elsewhere. we are also impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by the irs or other taxing authorities in connection with our tax audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope. any increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.
changes in accounting standards or the recognition of impairment or other charges may adversely affect our future operations and results.
new accounting standards or changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical accounting estimates, could adversely affect our future results. we may also be affected by the nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment or other charges that reduce our earnings. in assessing the recoverability of our long-lived assets, we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. these estimates are highly subjective and can be significantly impacted by many factors such as global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. if our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges. if we experience any such changes, they could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results for the affected periods.
a decrease in our credit ratings or an increase in our funding costs could adversely affect our profitability.
we may be negatively affected by the impact of changes in our debt levels or our results of operations on our credit ratings, interest expense, availability of acceptable counterparties, ability to obtain funding on favorable terms or our operating or financial flexibility, especially if lenders impose new operating or financial covenants. in particular, our credit rating was lowered as a result of our decision to increase our leverage and the pace of the return of cash to our shareholders.
our operations may also be impacted by regulations affecting capital flows, financial markets or financial institutions, which can limit our ability to manage and deploy our liquidity or increase our funding costs. if any of these events were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
trading volatility and price of our common stock may be adversely affected by many factors.
many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. the most important of these factors, some of which are outside our control, are the following:
▪   the continuing unpredictable global economic and market conditions;
▪   governmental action or inaction in light of key indicators of economic activity or events that can significantly influence financial markets, particularly in the united states which is the principal trading market for our common stock, and media reports and commentary about economic or other matters, even when the matter in question does not directly relate to our business;
▪   trading activity in our common stock or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our common stock or debt securities, which can be affected by market commentary (including commentary that may be unreliable or incomplete); unauthorized disclosures about our performance, plans or expectations about our business; our actual performance and creditworthiness; investor confidence generally; actions by shareholders and others seeking to influence our business strategies; portfolio transactions in our stock by significant shareholders; or trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which mcdonald's may be included, such as the s&amp;p 500 index and the dow jones industrial average;
▪   the impact of our stock repurchase program or dividend rate; and
▪   the impact on our results of corporate actions and market and third-party perceptions and assessments of such actions, such as those we may take from time to time as we review our corporate structure and strategies in light of business, legal and tax considerations.
our results and prospects can be adversely affected by events such as severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, among others.
severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, terrorist activities, health epidemics or pandemics (or expectations about them) can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels or other factors that affect our results and prospects, such as commodity costs. our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to certain of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to offset our losses fully.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview description of the business the company franchises and operates mcdonald's restaurants. of the 36,525 restaurants in 119 countries at year-end 2015, 30,081 were franchised (reflects 21,147 franchised to conventional franchisees, 5,529 licensed to developmental licensees and 3,405 licensed to foreign affiliates ("affiliates")-primarily japan) and 6,444 were operated by the company.
under mcdonald's conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and décor of their restaurant business, and by reinvesting in the business over time. the company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. this maintains long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees enabling restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry. in certain circumstances, the company participates in the reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants in an effort to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives.
under mcdonald's developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the company has no capital invested. in addition, the company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market.
mcdonald's is primarily a franchisor and believes franchising is paramount to delivering great-tasting food, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. franchising enables an individual to own a restaurant business and maintain control over staffing, purchasing, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the financial strength and global experience of mcdonald's. however, directly operating restaurants is important to being a credible franchisor and provides company personnel with restaurant operations experience. in company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, mcdonald's further develops and refines operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that the company believes are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants. mcdonald's continually reviews its mix of company-operated and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance, with a goal to be 95% franchised over the long term.
the company's revenues consist of sales by company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. fees vary by type of site, amount of company investment, if any, and local business conditions. these fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms.
through june 30, 2015, the company was managed as distinct geographic segments, comprised of the u.s., europe, asia/pacific, middle east and africa and other countries & corporate, which included canada and latin america. beginning july 1, 2015, mcdonald's started operating under a new organizational structure with the following segments that combine markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth:
•   u.s. - the company's largest segment. this segment did not change as a result of the new reporting structure.
•   international lead markets - established markets including australia, canada, france, germany, the u.k. and related markets.
•   high growth markets - markets believed to have relatively higher restaurant expansion and franchising potential including china, italy, korea, poland, russia, spain, switzerland, the netherlands and related markets.
•   foundational markets &amp; corporate - the remaining markets in the mcdonald's system, each of which is believed to have the potential to operate under a largely franchised model. corporate activities are also reported within this segment.
in september 2015, the company issued segment summary financial information and segment historical data in accordance with its new reporting structure for the previously reported years ended 2010 through 2014 and quarters ended march 31, 2014 through june 30, 2015. the segment information included herein is presented in accordance with the change in reporting structure for all periods presented.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, the u.s., international lead markets and high growth markets segments accounted for 34%, 30% and 24% of total revenues, respectively.
in analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and financial measures, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, systemwide sales growth, operating income growth and returns.
▪   constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases most incentive compensation plans on these results because the company believes this better represents its underlying business trends.
▪   comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of the impact of the company's initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the company or franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. typically, pricing has a greater impact on average check than product mix. the goal is to achieve a relatively balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check.
▪   systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants. while franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the company, management believes the information is important in understanding the company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base.
mcdonald's corporation 2015 annual report 13
▪   return on incremental invested capital ("roiic") is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the markets, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. the return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. the calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation.
strategic direction and financial performance the strength of the alignment among the company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the "system") has been key to mcdonald's long-term success. by leveraging the system, mcdonald's is able to identify, implement and scale ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. in addition, the company's business model enables the system to consistently deliver locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities it serves.
in 2015, the company and its board of directors took steps to reset its business and restore growth, which included the election of a new ceo in the first quarter. in may, management announced the initial steps of the company's turnaround plan, beginning with a worldwide restructuring in july. this resulted in a reorganization from a geographically-focused structure to segments that combine markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth. this new operating structure is designed to sharpen the company's focus on the customer, drive greater accountability, and remove distractions and bureaucracy. management expects the new structure to enable faster decision-making and an increased ability to move proven initiatives quickly across markets.
the system is focused on the fundamentals of running great restaurants by providing customers with what matters most to them - hot and fresh food, fast and friendly service, and a contemporary restaurant experience at the value of mcdonald's. in addition, mcdonald's is building on its competitive advantages of convenience, scale, geographic diversification and system alignment that have been created over time.
mcdonald's aspires to be viewed by its customers as a modern and progressive burger company delivering a contemporary customer experience. the priorities of the turnaround plan are threefold: drive operational growth, create brand excitement and enhance financial value.
to drive operational growth, the company is working to enhance the quality, choice and variety of its menu. in addition, the company is building upon investments it has already made in reimaging and technology to innovate the way customers can order and how they are served, which represent elements of the experience of the future. while execution and timing of these elements may be different in each market, experience of the future is designed to fundamentally enhance mcdonald's relationship with customers and their experience with the brand.
the company's brand efforts aim to reach customers in ways that drive greater excitement and are meaningful to them, such as fun, engaging marketing campaigns and focused support of communities. enhancements to the quality of mcdonald's menu, more local sourcing of ingredients, and commitments around sustainability efforts are all designed to improve consumer confidence in the brand.
the modifications to mcdonald's operating approach are accompanied by strategies to enhance financial value. in 2015, management announced plans to optimize the company's restaurant ownership mix by refranchising about 4,000 restaurants through 2018, deliver net annual g&a savings of about $500 million, the vast majority of which is expected to be realized by the end of 2017, and return about $30 billion to shareholders for the three-year period ending 2016.
mcdonald's maintains a strong financial foundation supported by industry-leading unit volumes that enable the company to pursue growth through business and economic cycles while returning significant amounts of cash to shareholders each year. cash from operations benefits from a heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income received from franchisees provides a stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs and enables co-investment, either through capital expenditures or rent incentives, with franchisees on key initiatives, such as reimaging. in addition, the franchise business model is less capital intensive as franchisees invest in the costs of going into business and most future reinvestment.
the company's substantial cash flow, strong investment grade credit rating and continued access to credit provides mcdonald's flexibility to fund capital expenditures as well as return cash to shareholders. after a thorough evaluation of financial opportunities, management announced plans to optimize the company's capital structure and increased the cash return to shareholders target to about $30 billion for the three-year period ending 2016 - a $10 billion increase over the previous target with incremental debt funding the vast majority of the increase. this proactive move in the company's leverage metrics and credit ratings still enables mcdonald's to efficiently and cost effectively access capital globally, while allowing for continued investment in the business. these actions, together with the decision of the board of directors to raise the dividend in 2015, reflect the board and management's confidence in mcdonald's future.
the company's financial results for 2015 reflect two distinct performance periods. during the first half of the year, the company took bold and urgent action to reset the business and refocus the system on its customers; however, operating performance was weak. the second half of the year was about execution, with results turning positive and providing tangible evidence that the turnaround plan is working.
in mcdonald's heavily franchised business model, growing comparable sales is important to increasing operating income and returns. global comparable sales increased 1.5% in 2015, driven by positive performance across all segments in the third and fourth quarters. consolidated guest counts were negative for the year.
u.s. comparable sales increased 0.5% and comparable guest counts declined 3.0%, though performance improved sequentially throughout the year with positive comparable sales in the third and fourth quarters.
comparable sales in the international lead markets grew 3.4% and comparable guest counts increased 1.0%. all major markets contributed to the positive comparable sales performance except france, which was impacted by macro-economic headwinds.
in the high growth markets, comparable sales increased 1.8% and comparable guest counts declined 2.2%. the increase in comparable sales was driven primarily by solid performance in china as the market successfully executed strong recovery plans following the prior year supplier issue.
comparable sales in the foundational markets increased 0.7% and comparable guest counts declined 3.7%. solid performance in many markets across asia, europe, latin america and the middle east were offset by negative comparable sales and guest counts in japan.
14 mcdonald's corporation 2015 annual report results for the year:
•   global comparable sales increased 1.5%, reflecting an increase in all segments. comparable guest counts declined 2.3%, as positive guest traffic in the international lead markets was more than offset by negative guest traffic in all other segments.
▪   systemwide sales, a non-gaap measure that includes franchised sales, decreased 6% (increased 3% in constant currencies).
▪   consolidated revenues decreased 7% (increased 3% in constant currencies).
▪   consolidated operating income decreased 10% (flat in constant currencies).
▪   diluted earnings per share was flat (increased 10% in constant currencies) at $4.80. results and comparisons were impacted by the following current and prior year items outside normal operations:
*   strategic charges, primarily related to goodwill impairment and other asset write-offs in conjunction with the company's refranchising initiatives, restructuring activities and incremental restaurant closings primarily in china, japan and the u.s., were partly offset by a gain on sale of property in the u.s. these items had a negative net impact on diluted earnings per share of $0.18 in 2015.
*   charges related to certain foreign tax matters and the china supplier issue had a negative impact on diluted earnings per share of $0.54 in 2014.
excluding the impact of these current and prior year items, earnings per share in constant currencies would have reflected an increase of $0.12 or 2% in 2015.
▪   cash provided by operations was $6.5 billion.
▪   one-year roiic was 1.5% and three-year roiic was negative 3.7% for the period ended december 31, 2015 (see reconciliation on page 28).
▪   the company increased the quarterly cash dividend per share 5% to $0.89 for the fourth quarter, equivalent to an annual dividend of $3.56 per share.
▪   the company returned $9.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases for the year. this brings the cumulative return to shareholders to $15.8 billion for the two-year period ending 2015 versus the targeted return of about $30 billion for the three-year period ending 2016.
▪   capital expenditures of $1.8 billion were split fairly evenly between new restaurant openings and reinvestment in existing restaurants. across the system, about 1,000 restaurants were opened and over 1,000 existing locations were reimaged.
areas of focus by segment u.s.
as the company's largest segment, the u.s. remains critical to the company's turnaround given its significant contribution to consolidated results. while results in the first half of 2015 were weak, the steps taken to enhance menu quality, simplify restaurant operations and offer more convenience to customers led to a meaningful shift in momentum starting in the third quarter.
menu initiatives in the u.s. include enhancing the taste of core products through new cooking procedures and continuing to evolve its menu and ingredients, including the introduction of the artisan grilled chicken and premium buttermilk crispy chicken deluxe sandwiches. the october launch of all day breakfast built on the positive momentum experienced during the third quarter. mcdonald's ability to move from one test market in april to a national launch in october in over 13,000 restaurants is a testament to the cultural changes the company is making to become more relevant to customers.
the u.s. is placing a renewed emphasis on running great restaurants. this includes simplifying the menu and operations and making it easier for guests to order and interact with the brand. customer feedback systems are showing improvements in many important aspects of the customer visit, including food quality, order accuracy, speed and friendliness.
the recent launch of mcdonald's mobile app in the u.s. is designed to capture additional demand and engage with customers in more fun, personal and relevant ways.
given the importance of value to its customers, the u.s. is working to establish a consistent national value offering. the goal is to provide customers more choice and flexibility, including the opportunity to bundle their own meals at compelling price points.
international lead markets the international lead markets remain relentlessly focused on customers and using data insights to better understand and respond to their changing needs and expectations.
these markets are focused on food quality, which includes modernizing cooking and service platforms to serve hotter, fresher food. local market initiatives include new recipes and quality ingredients, such as a range of new signature beef products in the u.k.
the international lead markets are working to improve the restaurant experience with a focus on customizing the menu for individual tastes, and offering customers different ways to order, pay for or receive their food. markets continue to test solutions like self-order kiosks, table service and curbside delivery that help restaurant teams better connect with and serve customers because they simplify operations. these solutions also enable restaurants to accommodate more customers during busy peak times, thereby driving overall business performance.
markets are at different stages, but all are making steady progress towards enhancing the customer experience. france is the furthest along with digital, web ordering, self-order kiosks and table service in the majority of restaurants. australia's platform focuses on personalization and customization of premium burgers, chicken sandwiches and salads ordered through self-order kiosks. canada and the u.k. have a number of experience of the future restaurants in place today and have plans to deploy more broadly in 2016.
the international lead markets continue to focus on sustainability and social responsibility to become an even more relevant and trusted brand.
high growth markets mcdonald's high growth markets are focused on creating customer excitement through menu, promotions and value, and implementing a digital strategy with specific mobile solutions and actions to build the business and brand trust.
in addition to driving operational growth in existing restaurants, targeted new restaurant development and refranchising initiatives are top priorities.
new restaurant openings totaled over 400 in 2015, while net additions were over 200. between 400-500 total openings are planned for 2016, primarily in china, with a strong emphasis on freestanding restaurants with drive-thru's. the high growth markets include about half of the system's planned global openings for 2016.
mcdonald's corporation 2015 annual report 15
foundational markets the foundational markets span over 80 countries across asia, europe, latin america, middle east and africa. this diverse group of markets share common goals of enhancing the critical elements that differentiate mcdonald's - the menu and the customer experience. menu efforts include emphasizing core favorites and ensuring strong everyday value platforms are in place, complemented by exciting new menu news tailored to local tastes and flavor preferences. the markets are placing a renewed commitment on running great restaurants and increasing convenience to customers, including drive-thru and delivery.
the segment is pursuing refranchising opportunities, including the sale of certain markets to developmental licensees.  mcdonald's is also exploring the sale of a portion of the company's ownership in mcdonald's japan to a strategic investor who could help advance japan's turnaround efforts, unlock the market's growth potential, and enhance value for all stakeholders.
outlook for 2016
as mcdonald's continues to execute its turnaround plan in 2016, the company is confident that these strategies will transform customer perceptions of mcdonald's as a modern and progressive burger company delivering a contemporary experience.
although some larger markets face challenging headwinds as the company enters 2016, mcdonald's expects continued positive top-line momentum across all segments. mcdonald's system is committed to elevating every aspect of the customer experience with the essential imperative of running great restaurants.
while the company does not provide specific guidance on earnings per share, the following global and certain segment-specific information is provided to assist in forecasting the company's future results.
•   changes in systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. the company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 1 percentage point to 2016 systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies).
•   the company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. however, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point change in comparable sales for either the u.s. or the international lead markets segment would change annual diluted earnings per share by about 4 cents.
•   with about 75% of mcdonald's grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the company's commodity costs. for the full-year 2016, costs for the total basket of goods are expected to decrease about 1-2% in the u.s. and remain relatively flat in the international lead markets segment.
•   the company expects full-year 2016 selling, general and administrative expenses to decrease about 1-2% in constant currencies, with fluctuations expected between the quarters. this includes expenses associated with our worldwide owner/operator convention in second quarter 2016 and sponsorship of the summer olympic games in third quarter 2016.
•   based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the company expects interest expense for the full-year 2016 to increase about 40-45% compared with 2015 due to higher average debt balances.
•   a significant part of the company's operating income is generated outside the u.s., and about 30% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the euro, british pound, australian dollar and canadian dollar. collectively, these currencies represent approximately 70% of the company's operating income outside the u.s. if all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the company's annual diluted earnings per share would change by up to 25 cents.
•   the company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2016 to be in the 31%-33% range. some volatility may be experienced between the quarters resulting in a quarterly tax rate outside of the annual range.
•   the company expects capital expenditures for 2016 to be approximately $2.0 billion, about half of which will be used to open new restaurants. the company expects to open about 1,000 restaurants, including about 400 restaurants in affiliated and developmental-licensee markets where the company does not fund any capital expenditures. the company expects net additions of about 500 restaurants. the remaining capital will be used to reinvest in existing locations, including about 400 to 500 reimages in the u.s.
•   the company plans to optimize its capital structure and expects to return about $30 billion to shareholders for the three-year period ending 2016. the cumulative return for the two years ended 2015 was nearly $16 billion, leaving about $14 billion to be completed in 2016. some of this remaining amount will be funded by issuing additional debt, of which approximately $6 billion was issued in the fourth quarter 2015.
long-term
•   the company expects to refranchise about 4,000 restaurants in the four-year period ending 2018 with a long-term goal to become 95% franchised. the majority of the refranchising will take place in the high growth and foundational markets. during 2015, we refranchised about 470 restaurants.
•   the company expects to realize net annual g&amp;a savings of about $500 million from our g&amp;a base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015, the vast majority of which is expected to be realized by the end of 2017. these savings will be realized through our refranchising efforts, streamlining resources across corporate, segment and market organizations, primarily in non-customer facing functions, and realizing greater efficiencies in the company's global business services platform. this target excludes the impact of foreign currency changes. we expect to realize a cumulative total of about $150 million in savings by the end of 2016, with about half of these savings already achieved in 2015.
•   in connection with executing against our refranchising and g&amp;a targets, we may incur incremental strategic charges associated with asset dispositions and restructuring.

net income and diluted earnings per common share in 2015, net income decreased 5% (increased 5% in constant currencies) to $4.5 billion and diluted earnings per common share was flat (increased 10% in constant currencies) at $4.80. foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.50 on diluted earnings per share.
in 2014, net income decreased 15% (13% in constant currencies) to $4.8 billion and diluted earnings per common share decreased 13% (11% in constant currencies) to $4.82. foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.12 on diluted earnings per share.
results in 2015 benefited from higher franchised margins and a gain on sale of property in the u.s., partly offset by strategic charges, primarily related to goodwill impairment and other asset write-offs in conjunction with the company's refranchising initiatives, restructuring and incremental restaurant closings. the strategic charges and gain on sale of property in the u.s. had a negative net impact on diluted earnings per share of $0.18 in 2015.
results in 2014 were negatively impacted by the following items that had a negative impact of $0.54 on diluted earnings per share:
•   $0.31 per share due to an increase in tax reserves for 2003-2010 resulting from an unfavorable lower tax court ruling in a foreign tax jurisdiction, as well as an increase in tax reserves related to audit progression in other foreign tax jurisdictions.
mcdonald's corporation 2015 annual report 17
•   $0.23 per share due to the estimated impact of a supplier issue in china. as a consequence, results in china, japan and certain other markets were negatively impacted due to lost sales and profitability, including expenses associated with customer recovery efforts.
excluding the impact of these current and prior year items, in 2015 earnings per share in constant currencies would have reflected an increase of $0.12 or 2%. in 2014, diluted earnings per share would have reflected a decrease of 3% (1% in constant currencies) excluding the 2014 charges related to certain foreign tax matters and the china supplier issue. this supplemental information is provided to assist investors in understanding the impact of significant items outside of normal operations.
the company repurchased 61.8 million shares of its stock for $6.2 billion in 2015 and 33.1 million shares of its stock for $3.2 billion in 2014, driving reductions in weighted-average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in both periods, which positively benefited earnings per share.
revenues the company's revenues consist of sales by company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales, minimum rent payments and initial fees. revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees.
the company is accelerating the pace of refranchising to optimize its restaurant ownership mix, generate more stable and predictable revenue and cash flow streams, and operate with a less resource-intensive structure. the shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants negatively impacts consolidated revenues as company-operated sales are replaced by franchised sales, where the company receives rent and/or royalty revenue based on a percentage of sales.
in 2015, constant currency revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales and the benefit from expansion. in 2014, constant currency revenue was flat compared to the prior year, reflecting the impact of negative comparable sales, partially offset by expansion.

franchised margins franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised restaurants less the company's occupancy costs (rent and depreciation) associated with those sites. franchised margin dollars represented about 70% of the combined restaurant margins in 2015, 2014 and 2013.
in 2015, franchised margin dollars decreased $297 million or 4% (increased 4% in constant currencies). the constant currency increase was due to positive comparable sales performance, expansion and refranchising. in 2014, franchised margin dollars decreased $32 million or 0% (increased 1% in constant currencies), reflecting a benefit from expansion and refranchising, offset by negative comparable sales performance.
in connection with the company's long-term financial targets, the company plans to refranchise about 4,000 restaurants for the four-year period ending 2018. while this refranchising activity may have a dilutive effect on the franchised margin percent, it typically results in higher franchised margin dollars.

•   us: in 2015, the decrease in the franchised margin percent was due to higher occupancy costs. in 2014, the decrease was primarily due to negative comparable sales and higher occupancy costs.
•   international lead markets: in 2015, the franchised margin percent reflected the benefit from positive comparable sales performance and the negative impact from higher lease expense and refranchising. in 2014, the decrease was due to weaker results in germany and the negative impact from refranchising, primarily in germany and australia, partly offset by positive results in the u.k.
•   high growth markets: in 2015, the decrease in the franchised margin percent was primarily due to the impact from refranchising. in 2014, the decrease was primarily due to negative comparable sales across the segment.
the franchised margin percent in foundational markets & corporate is higher relative to the other segments due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed and/or affiliated restaurants where the company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs.

•   u.s.: in 2015, the decrease in the company-operated margin percent was primarily due to the incremental investment in wages and benefits for eligible company-operated restaurant employees, effective july 1, 2015, designed to improve restaurant performance and enhance our employment proposition. in 2014, the decrease was due to the impact of negative comparable guest counts and higher commodity and labor costs, partly offset by higher average check.
•   international lead markets: in 2015, the increase in the company-operated margin percent was due to higher comparable sales and the result of refranchising efforts, partly offset by higher labor and occupancy costs. in 2014, the increase was primarily due to positive results in france, partly offset by weaker results in germany.
•   high growth markets: in 2015, the decrease in the company-operated margin percent was primarily due to the negative impact from currency and inflationary pressures in russia, and higher labor and occupancy costs across the segment. this was partly offset by the benefit from recovery in china from the 2014 supplier issue. in 2014, the decrease was primarily due to the negative impact of the supplier issue in china and weaker results in russia.

selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues was 9.6% in 2015, 9.1% in 2014 and 8.5% in 2013. selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales was 2.9% in 2015, 2.8% in 2014 and 2.7% in 2013. management believes that analyzing selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales, as well as revenues, is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support the overall mcdonald's business.
as a result of the re-categorization of all markets from the prior geographic segments into the new segments, historical market support expenses outside the u.s. were reallocated from the prior geographic segments into the new international segments for all periods presented. beginning july 1, 2015, the company centralized certain market support expenses previously incurred by the geographic segments into corporate. as a result, these expenses were included in the segment results prior to july 1, 2015 and in corporate results subsequent to that date.

▪   gains on sales of restaurant businesses in 2015, the company realized higher gains on sales of restaurant businesses, primarily in the u.s., mostly offset by lower gains in china and australia. in 2014, the decrease in results reflected lower gains, primarily in australia, china and the u.s.
▪   equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased in 2015 and 2014, primarily due to weaker results in japan, including the decision to close under-performing restaurants in 2015 and the supplier issue in 2014.
▪   asset dispositions and other (income) expense, net in 2015, results included a $135 million gain on the sale of property in the u.s., mostly offset by asset write-offs resulting from the decision to close under-performing restaurants, primarily in the u.s. and china. in 2014, the increase in asset dispositions and other expense was primarily due to higher asset write-offs and lower other income items in the u.s.
▪   impairment and other charges in 2015, the company recorded strategic charges related to goodwill and other asset write-offs in conjunction with its refranchising initiative in certain foundational markets and global restructuring activities. in 2014, impairment and other charges primarily reflected certain costs associated with the supplier issue in china.

•   u.s.: in 2015, the increase in operating income was due primarily to a gain on sale of property and higher franchised margin dollars, partly offset by lower company-operated margin dollars reflecting higher costs associated with the incremental investment in wages and benefits for eligible company-operated restaurant employees, effective july 1, 2015. in addition, 2015 results were negatively impacted by restructuring and restaurant closing charges. in 2014, the decrease in results was due to lower restaurant margin dollars, lower other operating income and higher selling, general and administrative expenses.
•   international lead markets: in 2015, the constant currency operating income increase was due primarily to higher franchised margin dollars, benefiting from positive comparable sales performance. in 2014, the constant currency increase was due primarily to higher franchised margin dollars, partly offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses.
•   high growth markets: in 2015, the constant currency operating income increase reflected recovery from the 2014 supplier issue in china and higher franchised margin dollars, partly offset by restaurant closing charges. in 2014, the decrease reflected the negative impact of the supplier issue and lower company-operated margin dollars in russia.
•   foundational markets and corporate: in 2015, the constant currency operating income decrease was due to strategic charges across the segment and weaker results in japan, as well as higher corporate selling, general and administrative expenses, including the centralization of certain costs. in 2014, the decrease primarily reflected lower company-operated margin dollars and weaker operating results in japan, due in part to the supplier issue.
•   operating margin operating margin is defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues. operating margin was 28.1% in 2015, 29.0% in 2014 and 31.2% in 2013.

22 mcdonald's corporation 2015 annual report provision for income taxes in 2015, 2014 and 2013, the reported effective income tax rates were 30.9%, 35.5% and 31.9%, respectively.
in 2014, the higher effective income tax rate was primarily due to a change in tax reserves for 2003-2010 resulting from an unfavorable lower tax court ruling in a foreign tax jurisdiction, as well as the impact of changes in tax reserves related to audit progression in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions. these items had a negative impact of 4.1% on the effective tax rate.
in 2013, the effective income tax rate included a tax benefit of nearly $50 million, reflecting the retroactive impact of certain tax benefits as a result of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012.
consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.8 billion in 2015 and $1.6 billion in 2014. substantially all of the net tax assets are expected to be realized in the u.s. and other profitable markets.
recently issued accounting standards revenue recognition in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued guidance codified in accounting standards codification ("asc") 606, "revenue recognition - revenue from contracts with customers," which amends the guidance in asc 605, "revenue recognition." in july 2015, the fasb made a decision to defer by one year the effective date of its new standard to january 1, 2018, although early adoption is permitted as of january 1, 2017.
the new standard allows for either a full retrospective or modified retrospective transition approach. the company does not believe that the standard will impact its recognition of revenue from company-operated restaurants or its recognition of royalties from restaurants operated by franchisees or licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees, which are based on a percent of sales. the company is continuing to evaluate the impact the adoption of this standard will have on the recognition of other less significant revenue transactions, such as initial fees from franchisees for new restaurant openings or new franchise terms.
cash flows the company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases.
cash provided by operations totaled $6.5 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $4.7 billion in 2015, while cash provided by operations totaled $6.7 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $4.1 billion in 2014. in 2015, cash provided by operations decreased $191 million or 3% compared with 2014, primarily due to lower operating results, including the impact from weaker foreign currencies, and other operating activity. this was partly offset by changes in working capital. in 2014, cash provided by operations decreased $390 million or 5% compared with 2013 primarily due to lower operating results, partly offset by lower income tax payments.
cash used for investing activities totaled $1.4 billion in 2015, a decrease of $885 million compared with 2014. the decrease primarily reflected lower capital expenditures. cash used for investing activities totaled $2.3 billion in 2014, a decrease of $369 million compared with 2013. the decrease primarily reflected lower capital expenditures, a decrease in other investing activities related to short-term time deposits and higher proceeds from sales of restaurant businesses.
cash provided by financing activities totaled $735 million in 2015, an increase of $5.4 billion compared with 2014, primarily due to an increase in net borrowings, partly offset by higher treasury stock purchases. cash used for financing activities totaled $4.6 billion in 2014, an increase of $575 million compared with 2013, primarily due to higher treasury stock purchases, partly offset by an increase in net borrowings.
the company's cash and equivalents balance was $7.7 billion and $2.1 billion at year end 2015 and 2014, respectively. the increase in 2015 was due to higher net borrowings to be used primarily for share repurchases in 2016. in addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements.
restaurant development and capital expenditures in 2015, the company opened 989 restaurants and closed 722 restaurants. in 2014, the company opened 1,316 restaurants and closed 487 restaurants. the increase in restaurant closings in 2015 reflected a strategic review that resulted in additional closures of under-performing restaurants. the company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure.

approximately 82% of the restaurants at year-end 2015 were franchised, including 90% in the u.s., 82% in international lead markets, 46% in high growth markets and 90% in foundational markets.
capital expenditures decreased $769 million or 30% in 2015, primarily due to fewer new restaurant openings and lower reinvestment at existing restaurants. capital expenditures decreased $242 million or 9% in 2014, primarily due to lower reinvestment in existing restaurants. in both years, the lower reinvestment primarily reflected fewer reimages.
capital expenditures invested in the u.s., international lead markets and high growth markets represented about 90% of the total in 2015, 2014 and 2013.

new restaurant investments in all years were concentrated in markets with strong returns or opportunities for long-term growth. average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. these costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally-sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, and leveraging best practices. although the company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment)

for new traditional mcdonald's restaurants in the u.s. averaged approximately $3.3 million in 2015.
the company owned approximately 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2015 and 2014.
share repurchases and dividends in 2015, the company returned approximately $9.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends paid. this brings the cumulative two-year return to shareholders to $15.8 billion versus our targeted return of about $30 billion for the three-year period ending 2016.

in may 2014, the company's board of directors approved a $10 billion share repurchase program with no specified expiration date ("2014 program"). in 2015, approximately 61.8 million shares were repurchased for $6.2 billion, bringing total purchases under the program to $8.1 billion. in december 2015, the company's board of directors terminated the 2014 program and replaced it with a new share repurchase program, effective january 1, 2016, that authorizes the purchase of up to $15 billion of the company's outstanding common stock with no specified expiration date.
on february 12, 2016, the company paid $2.7 billion under an accelerated share repurchase agreement and received an initial delivery of 18.5 million shares, which represents 80% of the total shares the company expects to receive based on the market price at the time of initial delivery. the final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the agreement, between april 1, 2016 and may 13, 2016, will be determined with reference to the volume weighted average price per share of the company's common stock over the term of the agreement, less a negotiated discount.
the company has paid dividends on its common stock for 40 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. the 2015 full year dividend of $3.44 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.85 per share, with an increase to $0.89 per share paid in the fourth quarter. this 5% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $3.56 per share annual dividend and reflects the company's confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. as in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the company's board of directors.
financial position and capital resources total assets and returns total assets increased $3.7 billion or 11% in 2015. excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, total assets increased $5.8 billion in 2015 primarily due to higher cash and equivalents. nearly 75% of total assets were in the u.s., international lead markets and high growth markets at year-end 2015. net property and equipment decreased $1.4 billion in 2015, primarily due to the impact of depreciation and foreign currency translation, partly offset by capital expenditures, and represented about 60% of total assets at year end.
operating income is used to compute return on average assets, while net income is used to calculate return on average common equity. month-end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity.

return on average common equity   45.1          31.3          35.8
in 2015, return on average assets decreased primarily due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation on operating income, partly offset by lower average assets, while return on average common equity increased primarily due to lower average common equity as a result of higher treasury stock purchases. in 2014, return on average assets and return on average common equity decreased, reflecting lower operating results. operating income does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. the inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by about two percentage points for all years presented.
financing and market risk the company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. debt obligations at december 31, 2015 totaled $24.1 billion, compared with $15.0 billion at december 31, 2014. the net increase in 2015 was primarily due to net long-term issuances of $9.7 billion in connection with the company's plans to optimize its capital structure.

certain of the company's debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. there are no provisions in the company's debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the company's business. under existing authorization from the company's board of directors, at december 31, 2015, the company had $4.0 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. in addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the u.s. securities and exchange commission ("sec") and a global medium-term notes program, the company has $2.5 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the u.s. and global markets (see debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements). debt maturing in 2016 is $787 million of long-term corporate debt. the company plans to issue long-term debt to refinance this maturing debt. as of december 31, 2015, the company's subsidiaries also had $732 million of borrowings outstanding, primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements.
the company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. the company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. the company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. all swaps are over-the-counter instruments.
in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. the company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. this reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders' equity. total foreign currency-denominated debt was $7.0 billion and $5.9 billion for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. in addition, where practical, the company's restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. see the summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives.
the company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. at december 31, 2015, the company was required to post an immaterial amount of collateral due to certain derivatives having negative positions. the company's counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the company's supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions.
the company's net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. the company's largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows:
foreign currency net asset exposures in millions of u.s. dollars        2015            2014

the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the company's results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the u.s. dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company's anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets. based on the results of these analyses of the company's financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2015 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2015 levels would materially affect the company's results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments.
liquidity the company has significant operations outside the u.s. where we earn about 60% of our operating income. a significant portion of these historical earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the company has made, and will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations. accordingly, no u.s. federal or state income taxes have been provided on these undistributed foreign earnings. the company's cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $1.5 billion as of december 31, 2015. we do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate these funds.
consistent with prior years, we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents, domestic cash flows from operations, annual repatriation of a portion of the current period's foreign earnings, and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating, investing, and financing activities. we also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating, investing, and financing activities.
in the future, should we require more capital to fund activities in the u.s. than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions. this could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the future.
while the likelihood is remote, to the extent foreign cash is available, the company could also elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested. upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the company may be subject to additional u.s. income taxes (net of an adjustment for foreign mcdonald's corporation 2015 annual report 25
tax credits), which could result in a use of cash. this could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the period in which such a determination is made to repatriate prior period foreign earnings. refer to the income taxes note to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to our income taxes and the undistributed earnings of the company's foreign subsidiaries.
contractual obligations and commitments the company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. in addition, the company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the company's borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. the following table summarizes the company's contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the company under existing franchise arrangements as of december 31, 2015. see discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

in the u.s., the company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of internal revenue service ("irs") limitations. at december 31, 2015, total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $488 million.
in addition, total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were $781 million at december 31, 2015.
there are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction, inventory, energy, marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business. the amounts related to these commitments are not significant to the company's financial position. such commitments are generally shorter term in nature and will be funded from operating cash flows.
other matters critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. on an ongoing basis, the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from these estimates.
the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. the company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity:
▪   property and equipment property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management's estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.
▪   share-based compensation the company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units ("rsus") to employees and nonemployee directors. the expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period.
the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. the pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the company's stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company's stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period.
▪   long-lived assets impairment review long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. in assessing the recoverability of the company's long-lived assets, the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the company's experience and knowledge of its operations. these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. a key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. if the company's estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to record impairment charges. based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, approximately 5-10% of goodwill may be at risk of future impairment as the fair values of certain reporting units were not substantially in excess of their carrying amounts.
26 mcdonald's corporation 2015 annual report
▪   litigation accruals in the ordinary course of business, the company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. a determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. the company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.
▪   income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. this could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made.
the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter.
in 2015, the company decreased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to settlements with taxing authorities by $258 million. in 2014, the company increased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken in prior years by $505 million, most of which came from foreign-related tax matters. after considering the impact of deferred tax offsets, interest and penalties, these foreign-related tax matters negatively impacted the effective tax rate by 4.1%. see the income taxes footnote in the consolidated financial statements for the related tax reconciliations. the most significant new developments in 2014 and 2015 are described below.
in 2014, the company received an unfavorable lower tax court ruling in a foreign tax jurisdiction related to exempt income matters. as a result of this new information, the company changed its judgment on the sustainability of this tax position for 2003-2010 and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of $188 million. in 2015, the company received an unfavorable decision related to its procedural efforts to appeal the 2014 unfavorable lower tax court ruling. as a result of this new information, the company agreed to settle the issue for 2003-2008 with the tax authorities and the unrecognized tax benefits were reduced by $143 million. no cash payment was made related to this settlement in 2015 as the company had previously made a payment to the taxing authority. the settlement did not have a material impact on the company's cash flows, results of operations or financial position.
in 2014, the internal revenue service ("irs") concluded its field examination of the company's u.s. federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010. in connection with this examination, the company agreed to certain adjustments proposed by the irs. the liabilities previously recorded related to these adjustments were adequate. in early 2015, the irs issued a revenue agent report for these agreed adjustments and the balance of unrecognized tax benefits was reduced by $102 million.
also in 2014 in connection with the irs examination of 2009-2010, the company received notices of proposed adjustments related to certain transfer pricing matters and engaged in audit defense discussions with the irs. as a result of this new information in 2014, the company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of $38 million. the company disagrees with these proposed adjustments and filed a protest with the irs appeals office in 2015. the company expects resolution on these issues in either 2016 or 2017.
in 2014, the company received new information from tax authorities during the progression of tax audits in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions, including the receipt of proposed tax assessments primarily related to transfer pricing matters. as a result of this new information, the company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of $207 million. the company settled certain of these tax audits in 2014 and plans to defend its position with the tax authorities on the remaining audits. in 2015, there was no significant progression on these audits.
in december 2015, the european commission opened a formal investigation directly with the luxembourg government to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid. if this matter is adversely resolved, luxembourg may be required to assess, and the company may be required to pay, additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase.
while the company cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the aforementioned tax matters, we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined in accordance with topic 740 - income taxes of the accounting standards codification ("asc").
deferred u.s. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $14.9 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates. the temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the u.s. if management's intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided.
effects of changing prices-inflation the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. this ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation.
mcdonald's corporation 2015 annual report 27
reconciliation of returns on incremental invested capital roiic is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of our markets, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. this measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. the numerator is the company's incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period.
the denominator is the weighted-average cash used for investing activities during the applicable one-or three-year period. the weighted-average cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. these weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter's investing activities to incremental operating income. for example, fourth quarter 2015 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2015 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations). in contrast, fourth quarter 2014 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full-year impact on 2015 operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2014 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations, respectively). cash used for investing activities can vary significantly by quarter, resulting in a weighted-average that may be higher or lower than the simple average of the periods presented. management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average.
the reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s., for the numerator and denominator of the one-year and three-year roiic are as follows:

item 1a. risk factors these risks, which should be considered carefully with the information provided elsewhere in this report, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
the integration of the hillshire brands company may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, and the acquisition may not result in any or all of the anticipated benefits, including cost synergies.
the success of the acquisition of hillshire brands, including the realization of the anticipated benefits, will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate hillshire brands' businesses in an efficient and effective manner. we may not be able to accomplish this integration process smoothly or successfully. the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities and addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration. failure to effectively integrate the businesses could adversely impact the expected benefits of the acquisition, including cost synergies stemming from supply chain efficiencies, merchandising activities and overlapping general and administrative functions.
the integration of two large companies is complex, and we will be required to devote significant management attention and incur substantial costs to integrate hillshire brands' and tyson's business practices, policies, cultures and operations. this diversion of our management's attention from day-to-day business operations and the execution and pursuit of strategic plans and initiatives could result in performance shortfalls, which could adversely impact the combined company's business, operations and financial results. the integration process could also result in the loss of key employees, which could adversely impact the combined company's future financial results.
furthermore, during the integration planning process, we may encounter additional challenges and difficulties, including those related to, without limitation, managing a larger combined company; streamlining supply chains, consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating overlapping operations; retaining our existing vendors and customers; unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems; and unforeseen and unexpected liabilities related to the acquisition of hillshire brands' business. delays encountered in the integration could adversely impact the business, financial condition and operations of the combined company.
6
we continue to evaluate our estimates of synergies to be realized from the hillshire brands acquisition and refine them. our actual cost-savings could differ materially from our current estimates. actual cost-savings, the costs required to realize the cost-savings and the source of the cost-savings could differ materially from our estimates, and we cannot assure you that we will achieve the full amount of cost-savings on the schedule anticipated or at all or that these cost-savings programs will not have other adverse effects on our business. in light of these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on our estimated cost-savings.
finally, we may not be able to achieve the targeted operating or long-term strategic benefits of the hillshire brands acquisition or could incur higher transition costs. an inability to realize the full extent of, or any of, the anticipated benefits of the hillshire brands acquisition, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
fluctuations in commodity prices and in the availability of raw materials, especially feed grains, live cattle, live swine and other inputs could negatively impact our earnings.
our results of operations and financial condition, as well as the selling prices for our products, are dependent upon the cost and supply of commodities and raw materials such as pork, beef, poultry, corn, soybean, packaging materials and energy and, to a lesser extent, cheese, fruit, seasoning blends, flour, corn syrup, corn oils, butter and sugar. corn, soybean meal and other feed ingredients, for instance, represented roughly 64% of our cost of growing a live chicken in fiscal 2015. production and pricing of these commodities are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand over which we have limited or no control. such factors include, among other things, weather patterns throughout the world, outbreaks of disease, the global level of supply inventories and demand for grains and other feed ingredients, as well as agricultural and energy policies of domestic and foreign governments.
volatility in our commodity and raw material costs directly impact our gross margin and profitability. the company's objective is to offset commodity price increases with pricing actions over time. however, we may not be able to increase our product prices enough to sufficiently offset increased raw material costs due to consumer price sensitivity or the pricing postures of our competitors. in addition, if we increase prices to offset higher costs, we could experience lower demand for our products and sales volumes. conversely, decreases in our commodity and other input costs may create pressure on us to decrease our prices. while we use derivative financial instruments, primarily futures and options, to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity, we do not fully hedge against changes in commodities prices.
over time, if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs, to offset operating cost increases with continuous improvement savings or are not successful in our commodity hedging program, then commodity and raw material price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our profitability, financial condition and results of operations.
the prices we receive for our products may fluctuate due to competition from other food producers and processors.
the food industry in general is intensely competitive. we face competition from other food producers and processors that have various product ranges and geographic reach. some of the factors on which we compete include: pricing, product safety and quality, brand identification, innovation, breadth and depth of product offerings, availability of our products and competing products, customer service, and credit terms.
from time to time in response to these competitive pressures or to maintain market share, we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products or increase or reallocate spending on marketing, advertising and promotions and new product innovation. such pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices in response to raw material and other cost increases. any reduction in prices as a result of competitive pressures, or any failure to increase prices to offset cost increases, could harm our profit margins. if we reduce prices but we cannot increase sales volumes to offset the price changes, then our financial condition and results of operations will suffer. alternatively, if we do not reduce our prices and our competitors seek advantage through pricing or promotional changes, our revenues and market share would be adversely affected.
outbreaks of livestock diseases can adversely impact our ability to conduct our operations and demand for our products.
demand for our products can be adversely impacted by outbreaks of livestock diseases, which can have a significant impact on our financial results. efforts are taken to control disease risks by adherence to good production practices and extensive precautionary measures designed to ensure the health of livestock. however, outbreaks of disease and other events, which may be beyond our control, either in our own livestock or cattle and hogs owned by independent producers who sell livestock to us, could significantly affect demand for our products, consumer perceptions of certain protein products, the availability of livestock for purchase by us and our ability to conduct our operations. moreover, the outbreak of livestock diseases, particularly in our chicken segment, could have a significant effect on the livestock we own by requiring us to, among other things, destroy any affected livestock. furthermore, an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our products to or from our suppliers, facilities or customers. this could also result in negative publicity that may have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our financial results.
7
we are subject to risks associated with our international activities, which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries, as well as our operations and assets in such countries.
in fiscal 2015, we sold products to approximately 130 countries. major sales markets include brazil, canada, central america, china, the european union, japan, mexico, the middle east, south korea, and taiwan. our sales to customers in foreign countries for fiscal 2015 totaled $5.2 billion, of which $4.1 billion related to export sales from the united states. in addition, we had approximately $191 million of long-lived assets located in foreign countries, primarily brazil, china, and india, at the end of fiscal 2015.
as a result, we are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including:
â€¢   imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other trade protection measures imposed by foreign countries regarding the importation of poultry, beef, pork and prepared foods products, in addition to import or export licensing requirements imposed by various foreign countries;
â€¢   closing of borders by foreign countries to the import of poultry, beef and pork products due to animal disease or other perceived health or safety issues;
â€¢   impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the united states dollar and foreign currencies, particularly the brazilian real, the british pound sterling, the canadian dollar, the chinese renminbi, the european euro, the japanese yen and the mexican peso;
â€¢   political and economic conditions;
â€¢   difficulties and costs to comply with, and enforcement of remedies under, a wide variety of complex domestic and international laws, treaties and regulations, including, without limitation, the united states foreign corrupt practices act and economic and trade sanctions enforced by the united states department of the treasury's office of foreign assets control;
â€¢   different regulatory structures and unexpected changes in regulatory environments;
â€¢   tax rates that may exceed those in the united states and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and incremental taxes upon repatriation;
â€¢   potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; and
â€¢   distribution costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation.
negative consequences relating to these risks and uncertainties could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business in one or more of those markets where we operate or in other developing markets and could adversely affect our financial results.
we depend on the availability of, and good relations with, our employees.
we have approximately 113,000 employees, approximately 36,000 of whom are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are members of labor unions. our operations depend on the availability and relative costs of labor and maintaining good relations with employees and the labor unions. if we fail to maintain good relations with our employees or with the labor unions, we may experience labor strikes or work stoppages, which could adversely affect our financial results.
we depend on contract growers and independent producers to supply us with livestock.
we contract primarily with independent contract growers to raise the live chickens and turkeys processed in our poultry operations. a majority of our cattle and hogs are purchased from independent producers who sell livestock to us under marketing contracts or on the open market. if we do not attract and maintain contracts with growers or maintain marketing and purchasing relationships with independent producers, our production operations could be negatively affected.
if our products become contaminated, we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls.
our products may be subject to contamination by disease-producing organisms or pathogens, such as listeria monocytogenes, salmonella and e. coli. these organisms and pathogens are found generally in the environment and there is a risk that one or more, as a result of food processing, could be present in our products. these organisms and pathogens also can be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling at the further-processing, foodservice or consumer level. these risks may be controlled, but may not be eliminated, by adherence to good manufacturing practices and finished product testing. we have little, if any, control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution. even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products may be a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims, increased scrutiny and penalties, including injunctive relief and plant closings, by federal and state regulatory agencies, and adverse publicity, which could exacerbate the associated negative consumer reaction. any of these occurrences may have an adverse effect on our financial results.
in addition, we may be required to recall some of our products if they spoil, become contaminated, are tampered with or are mislabeled. a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. such a product recall also could result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands.
8
changes in consumer preference and failure to maintain favorable consumer perception of our brands and products could negatively impact our business.
the food industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends, demands and preferences. trends within the food industry change often, and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to, among other things, reduced demand and price reductions for our brands and products. we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations, but we may not be successful in our efforts.
we could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients, or the food safety system generally. prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products or ingredients or loss of confidence in the food safety system generally could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs. continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.
we have a number of iconic brands with significant value. maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business. brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences or the products becoming unavailable to consumers.
failure to continually innovate and successfully launch new products and maintain our brand image through marketing investment could adversely impact our operating results.
our financial success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences and dietary habits and successfully developing and launching new products and product extensions that consumers want. we devote significant resources to new product development and product extensions, however we may not be successful in developing innovative new products or our new products may not be commercially successful. to the extent we are not able to effectively gauge the direction of our key markets and successfully identify, develop, manufacture and market new or improved products in these changing markets, our financial results and our competitive position will suffer. in addition, our introduction of new products or product extensions may generate litigation or other legal proceedings against us by competitors claiming infringement of their intellectual property or other rights, which could negatively impact our results of operations.
we also seek to maintain and extend the image of our brands through marketing investments, including advertising, consumer promotions and trade spend. due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising, promotions and new product introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance, our marketing investments may not prove successful in maintaining or increasing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits. continuing global focus on health and wellness, including weight management, and increasing media attention to the role of food marketing could adversely affect our brand image or lead to stricter regulations and greater scrutiny of food marketing practices.
our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image also depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. the growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. negative posts or comments about us, our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our reputation and brand image.
we are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions on how and to whom we market our products, for instance marketing to children, which may limit our ability to maintain or extend our brand image. if we do not maintain or extend our brand image, then our product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
failure to leverage our brand value propositions to compete against private label products, especially during economic downturn, may adversely affect our profitability.
in many product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with private label products that generally are sold at lower prices. consumers are more likely to purchase our products if they believe that our products provide a higher quality and greater value than less expensive alternatives. if the difference in quality between our brands and private label products narrows, or if there is a perception of such a narrowing, consumers may choose not to buy our products at prices that are profitable for us. in addition, in periods of economic uncertainty, consumers tend to purchase more lower-priced private label or other economy brands. to the extent this occurs, we could experience a reduction in the sales volume of our higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings. in addition, in times of economic uncertainty, consumers reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at our foodservice customers, which in turn reduces our product sales.
9
our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could negatively impact our business and liquidity position.
our indebtedness, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility, may increase from time to time for various reasons, including fluctuations in operating results, working capital needs, capital expenditures and possible acquisitions, joint ventures or other significant initiatives. our consolidated indebtedness level could adversely affect our business because:
â€¢   it may limit or impair our ability to obtain financing in the future;
â€¢   our credit ratings (or any decrease to our credit ratings) could restrict or impede our ability to access capital markets at desired interest rates and increase our borrowing costs;
â€¢   it may reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to take advantage of business opportunities that may arise;
â€¢   a portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to interest payments on our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes; and
â€¢   it may restrict our ability to pay dividends.
our revolving credit and term loan facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens and encumbrances; incur debt; merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate; make acquisitions and investments; dispose of or transfer assets; change the nature of our business; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and enter into hedging transactions, in each case, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. in addition, we are required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum debt to capitalization ratios.
our senior notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens; engage in certain sale/leaseback transactions; and engage in certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.
an impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. in assessing the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, we make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying these factors. goodwill valuations have been calculated principally using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. indefinite life intangible asset valuations have been calculated principally using relief-from-royalty and excess earnings approaches and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. under these valuation approaches, we are required to make various judgmental assumptions about appropriate discount rates. disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions, could, among other things, cause us to increase the discount rate used in the valuations. we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines. these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in impairment charges in the future, which could be substantial. as of october 3, 2015, we had $10.7 billion of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, which represented approximately 47% of total assets.
new or more stringent domestic and international government regulations could impose material costs on us and could adversely affect our business.
our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and foreign laws and regulations by authorities that oversee food safety standards and processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling and export of our products. see "environmental regulation and food safety" in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected. for example, increased governmental interest in advertising practices may result in regulations that could require us to change or restrict our advertising practices.
increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us. we use natural gas, diesel fuel and electricity in the manufacturing and distribution of our products. legislation or regulation affecting these inputs could materially affect our profitability. in addition, climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience and may require us to make additional unplanned capital expenditures.
10
legal claims, other regulatory enforcement actions, or failure to comply with applicable legal standards or requirements could affect our product sales, reputation and profitability.
we operate in a highly regulated environment with constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks. consequently, we are subject to heightened risk of legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions. although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies and procedures. moreover, a failure to maintain effective control processes could lead to violations, unintentional or otherwise, of laws and regulations. legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our product sales, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand, introducing new products, building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results.
the company is subject to stringent environmental regulation and potentially subject to environmental litigation, proceedings, and investigations.
our past and present business operations and ownership and operation of real property are subject to stringent federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, and the handling and disposition of wastes (including solid and hazardous wastes) or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. compliance with these laws and regulations, and the ability to comply with any modifications to these laws and regulations, is material to our business. new matters or sites may be identified in the future that will require additional investigation, assessment, or expenditures. in addition, some of our facilities have been in operation for many years and, over time, we and other prior operators of these facilities may have generated and disposed of wastes that now may be considered hazardous. future discovery of contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of our present or former properties or manufacturing facilities and/or waste disposal sites could require us to incur additional expenses. the occurrence of any of these events, the implementation of new laws and regulations, or stricter interpretation of existing laws or regulations, could adversely affect our financial results.
failures or security breaches of our information technology systems could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business.
information technology is an important part of our business operations and we increasingly rely on information technology systems to manage business data and increase efficiencies in our production and distribution facilities and inventory management processes. we also use information technology to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. in addition, we depend on information technology for digital marketing and electronic communications between our facilities, personnel, customers and suppliers. like other companies, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions, including during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, hackers, unauthorized access attempts and other security issues. we have implemented technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans to mitigate our exposure to these risks, but these measures may not be adequate. any significant failure of our systems, including failures that prevent our systems from functioning as intended, could cause transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, loss of customers and sales, have negative consequences on our employees and our business partners and have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation.
in addition, if we are unable to prevent security breaches, we may suffer financial and reputational damage or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, customers, consumers or suppliers. in addition, the disclosure of non-public sensitive information through external media channels could lead to the loss of intellectual property or damage our reputation and brand image.
if we pursue strategic acquisitions or divestitures, we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses.
we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures and other initiatives, and may seek to expand our business through the acquisition of companies, processing plants, technologies, products and services. acquisitions and joint ventures involve financial and operational risks and uncertainties, including:
â€¢   challenges in realizing the anticipated benefits of the transaction;
â€¢   difficulty integrating acquired businesses, technologies, operations and personnel with our existing business;
â€¢   diversion of management attention in connection with negotiating transactions and integrating the businesses acquired;
â€¢   difficulty identifying suitable candidates or consummating a transaction on terms that are favorable to us;
â€¢   challenges in retaining the acquired businesses' customers and key employees;
â€¢   inability to implement and maintain consistent standards, controls, procedures and information systems;
â€¢   exposure to unforeseen or undisclosed liabilities of acquired companies; and
â€¢   the availability and terms of additional debt or equity financing for any transaction.
we may not be able to address these risks and successfully develop these acquired companies or businesses into profitable units. if we are unable to do this, such expansion could adversely affect our financial results.
11
market fluctuations could negatively impact our operating results as we hedge certain transactions.
our business is exposed to fluctuating market conditions. we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to various market risks including changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. we hold certain positions, primarily in grain and livestock futures, that do not qualify as hedges for financial reporting purposes. these positions are marked to fair value, and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date. therefore, losses on these contracts will adversely affect our reported operating results. while these contracts reduce our exposure to changes in prices for commodity products, the use of such instruments may ultimately limit our ability to benefit from favorable commodity prices.
deterioration of economic conditions could negatively impact our business.
our business may be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, access to capital markets, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs (including fuel surcharges) and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. any such changes could adversely affect the demand for our products, or the cost and availability of our needed raw materials, cooking ingredients and packaging materials, thereby negatively affecting our financial results.
disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could, among other things:
â€¢   make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or to refinance our debt in the future;
â€¢   cause our lenders to depart from prior credit industry practice and make more difficult or expensive the granting of any amendment of, or waivers under, our credit agreements to the extent we may seek them in the future;
â€¢   impair the financial condition of some of our customers and suppliers, thereby increasing customer bad debts or non-performance by suppliers;
â€¢   negatively impact global demand for protein products, which could result in a reduction of sales, operating income and cash flows;
â€¢   decrease the value of our investments in equity and debt securities, including our marketable debt securities, company-owned life insurance and pension and other postretirement plan assets;
â€¢   negatively impact our commodity purchasing activities if we are required to record losses related to derivative financial instruments; or
â€¢   impair the financial viability of our insurers.
the loss of one or more of our largest customers could negatively impact our business.
our business could suffer significant setbacks in sales and operating income if our customers' plans and/or markets change significantly or if we lost one or more of our largest customers, including, for example, wal-mart stores, inc., which accounted for 16.8% of our sales in fiscal 2015. our retail customers typically do not enter into written contracts, and if they do sign contracts, they generally are limited in scope and duration. there can be no assurance that significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past. many of our customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs and food distributors, have consolidated in recent years, and consolidation is expected to continue throughout the united states and in other major markets. these consolidations have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories, opposing price increases, and demanding lower pricing, increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products. these customers also may use shelf space currently used for our products for their own private label products. because of these trends, our volume growth could slow or we may need to lower prices or increase promotional spending for our products. the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to, or adverse change to trade terms with, a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.
extreme factors or forces beyond our control could negatively impact our business.
our ability to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. natural disasters, fire, bioterrorism, pandemic or extreme weather, including droughts, floods, excessive cold or heat, hurricanes or other storms, could impair the health or growth of livestock or interfere with our operations due to power outages, fuel shortages, damage to our production and processing facilities or disruption of transportation channels, among other things. any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our financial results.
failure to maximize or to successfully assert our intellectual property rights could impact our competitiveness.
we consider our intellectual property rights, particularly and most notably our trademarks, but also our trade secrets, patents and copyrights, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws, as well as licensing agreements, third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. we cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted. there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions.
12
we cannot be sure that these rights, if obtained, will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future. in addition, even if such rights are obtained in the united states, the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states. our failure to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
tyson limited partnership can exercise significant control.
as of october 3, 2015, tyson limited partnership (the tlp) owns 99.985% of the outstanding shares of the company's class b common stock, $0.10 par value (class b stock) and the tlp and members of the tyson family own, in the aggregate, 1.79% of the outstanding shares of the company's class a common stock, $0.10 par value (class a stock), giving them, collectively, control of approximately 70.64% of the total voting power of the company's outstanding voting stock. at this time, the tlp does not have a managing general partner, as such, the management rights of the managing general partner may be exercised by a majority of the percentage interests of the general partners. as of october 3, 2015, mr. john tyson, chairman of the board of directors, has 33.33% of the general partner percentage interests, and ms. barbara tyson, a director of the company, has 11.115% general partner percentage interests (the remaining general partnership interests are held by the tyson partnership interest trust (44.44%) and harry c. erwin, iii (11.115%)). as a result of these holdings, positions and directorships, the partners in the tlp have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over our management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by our stockholders, including amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws, the election and removal of directors, any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions. this concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change in control otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price. additionally, as a result of the tlp's significant ownership of our outstanding voting stock, we are eligible for "controlled company" exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements of the new york stock exchange.
we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax liabilities.
we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. our total income tax expense could be affected by changes in tax rates in various jurisdictions, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities. there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties, which could adversely affect our financial results.
we could incur substantial tax liabilities as a result of the demb master blenders 1753 n.v ("demb") spin-off.
on june 28, 2012, hillshire brands divested its international coffee and tea business segment through the spin-off of demb (the "spin-off"). hillshire brands intended for the spin-off and certain related transactions to qualify as tax-free under sections 355, 368(a)(1)(d), and 361 and related provisions of the united states internal revenue code, which we refer to as the code, and hillshire brands received a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that the spin-off and certain related transactions, including a debt exchange, will qualify as tax-free to hillshire brands and its stockholders for united states federal income tax purposes. although a private letter ruling generally is binding on the irs, if the factual representations or assumptions made in the private letter ruling request are untrue or incomplete in any material respect, or any material forward-looking covenants or undertakings are not complied with, then hillshire brands would not be able to rely on the ruling. in addition, the ruling is based on current law, and cannot be relied upon if the applicable law changes with retroactive effect. as a matter of practice the irs does not rule on every requirement for a tax-free spin-off or tax-free debt-for-debt exchange, and the parties relied solely on the opinion of counsel for comfort that such additional requirements should be satisfied. the opinion of counsel relies on, among other things, the continuing validity of the ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by hillshire brands and demb which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by counsel in its opinion. the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail. accordingly, even though hillshire brands obtained a ruling and a "should" opinion of counsel, the irs could assert that hillshire brands has not satisfied the requirements for tax-free treatment and such assertion, if successful, could result in significant united states federal income tax liabilities for us.

events subsequent to the spin-off could cause the spin-off to become taxable. under the terms of the tax sharing agreement hillshire brands entered into with demb in connection with the spin-off, demb will generally be required to indemnify hillshire brands for 100% of any taxes imposed on demb and its subsidiaries or hillshire brands and its subsidiaries in the event that the spin-off and certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment as a result of an acquisition of demb (including the acquisition of demb by j.a. benckiser), or actions or omissions (including breaches of certain representations and warranties made in the tax sharing agreement) by demb or any of its affiliates. however, if the spin-off or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment because of actions or omissions by hillshire brands or any of its affiliates, hillshire brands would be responsible for all such taxes. in addition, hillshire brands would be responsible for 50% of any taxes resulting from the failure of the spin-off and certain related transactions to qualify as tax-free, which failure is not due to actions or omissions (including breaches of certain representations and warranties made in the tax sharing agreement) by hillshire brands, demb or any of hillshire brands' or demb's respective subsidiaries. there can be no assurance that the tax sharing agreement will be sufficient to protect hillshire brands against any tax liabilities that may arise, or that demb will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. hillshire brands' inability to enforce the indemnification provisions of the tax sharing agreement or obtain indemnification payments in a timely manner could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
participation in a multiemployer pension plan could adversely affect our business.
through our wholly owned subsidiary, hillshire brands, we participate in a "multiemployer" pension plan administered by a labor union representing some of its employees. we are required to make periodic contributions to this plan to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants. our required contributions to this fund could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to this fund, inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. in the event that we withdraw from participation in this plan, then applicable law could require us to make an additional lump-sum contribution to the plan, and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. our withdrawal liability would depend on the extent of the plan's funding of vested benefits. the multiemployer plan in which we participate is reported to have significant underfunded liabilities. such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability. in the event a withdrawal or partial withdrawal was to occur with respect to the multiemployer plan, the impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material.
volatility in the capital markets or interest rates could adversely impact our pension costs and the funded status of our pension plans.
we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states. the difference between plan obligations and assets, which signifies the funded status of the plans, is a significant factor in determining the net periodic benefit costs of the pension plans and our ongoing funding requirements. as of october 3, 2015, the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans was an underfunded position of $410 million, as compared to an underfunded position of $381 million at the end of fiscal 2014. changes in interest rates and the market value of plan assets can impact the funded status of the plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and our future funding requirements. the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors, including minimum funding requirements.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations description of the company we are one of the world's largest food companies with leading brands such as tysonÂ®, jimmy deanÂ®, hillshire farmÂ®, sara leeÂ®, ball parkÂ®, wrightÂ®, aidellsÂ® and state fairÂ®. we are a recognized market leader in chicken, beef and pork as well as prepared foods, including bacon, breakfast sausage, turkey, lunchmeat, hot dogs, pizza crusts and toppings, tortillas and desserts. some of the key factors influencing our business are customer demand for our products; the ability to maintain and grow relationships with customers and introduce new and innovative products to the marketplace; accessibility of international markets; market prices for our products; the cost and availability of live cattle and hogs, raw materials, and feed ingredients; and operating efficiencies of our facilities.
we operate in four reportable segments: chicken, beef, pork and prepared foods. following the sale of our mexico and brazil operations in fiscal 2015, we began reporting our international operation, which was previously reported as the international segment, in other. other now includes our foreign chicken production operations in china and india and third-party merger and integration costs. all periods presented have been reclassified to reflect this change. chicken, beef, pork and prepared foods results were not impacted by this change.
on august 28, 2014, we acquired and consolidated the hillshire brands company ("hillshire brands"), a manufacturer and marketer of branded, convenient foods. hillshire brands results from operations subsequent to the acquisition closing are included in the prepared foods segment.
overview
â€¢   fiscal year - our accounting cycle resulted in a 53-week year for fiscal 2015 and a 52-week year for 2014 and 2013.
â€¢   general - operating income grew 52% in fiscal 2015 over fiscal 2014, which was led by record earnings in our chicken and prepared foods segments. sales increased 10% to a record $41.4 billion, driven by price and mix improvements, the incremental impact of hillshire brands and the positive impact of 53 weeks in fiscal 2015. we continued to execute our strategy of accelerating growth in domestic value-added chicken sales, prepared food sales, innovating products, services and customer insights and cultivating our talent development to support tyson's growth for the future.
â€¢   hillshire integration - we continue to maintain focus on the integration of hillshire brands and synergy capture. as we execute our prepared foods strategy, we estimate the impact of the hillshire brands synergies, along with the profit improvement plan related to our legacy prepared foods business, will have a positive impact of more than $500 million in fiscal 2016 and more than $700 million by fiscal 2017. the majority of these benefits are expected to be realized in the prepared foods segment. we will invest a portion of the synergies in innovation, new product launches and strengthening our brands. in fiscal 2015, we captured $322 million of synergies and profit improvement initiatives, of which $285 million impacted the prepared foods segment.
â€¢   market environment - our chicken segment delivered record results in fiscal 2015 driven by strong demand and favorable domestic market conditions, partially offset by disruptions caused by export bans. the pork segment results remained in its normalized operating margin range, but were down from last year due to unfavorable market conditions from a decline in exports and periods of increased domestic availability of pork products. our prepared foods segment delivered record operating income and operating margins as we continued to execute our profit improvement plan and integrate hillshire brands. the beef segment experienced a loss driven by lower availability of fed cattle supplies, higher fed cattle costs, export market disruptions, and reduced demand for premium beef products due to the relative value of competing proteins.
â€¢   mexico - we recorded a $161 million pre-tax gain as a result of the sale of our mexico operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. the gain is reflected in other for segment reporting and included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income.
â€¢   china impairment - following the sale of our mexico and brazil chicken production operations, we have continued to review our strategies and outlook for the remaining international businesses, which operations include our chicken production operations in china. despite our belief in the potential for this business, our chinese operations have not achieved profitability. given the ongoing losses being generated in this business, recent changes in the strategy and management of the business, and the depressed economic outlook for china, we assessed our chinese operations for potential impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. as a result of this evaluation, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a $169 million impairment charge. the impairment was comprised of $126 million of property, plant and equipment, $23 million of goodwill and $20 million of other assets. the china operation is included in other for segment reporting and the impairment is included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income.
23
â€¢   margins - our total operating margin was 5.2% in fiscal 2015. operating margins by segment were as follows:
â€¢   chicken - 12.0%
â€¢   beef - (0.4)% (included $12 million closure and impairment charges related to the ceasing of beef operations at our denison facility)
â€¢   pork - 7.2%
â€¢   prepared foods - 7.5% (included $8 million in net insurance proceeds related to a legacy hillshire brands plant fire, $10 million in merger and integration costs and $59 million in prepared foods network optimization impairment charges)
â€¢   liquidity - during fiscal 2015, we generated $2.6 billion of operating cash flows. we repurchased 11.0 million shares of our class a common stock for $455 million under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2015. at october 3, 2015, we had $1.9 billion of liquidity, which included the availability under our revolving credit facility and $688 million of cash and cash equivalents.

2015 vs. 2014 -
â€¢   sales volume - sales were positively impacted by higher sales volume, which accounted for an increase of $2.4 billion. the chicken segment had an increase in sales volume primarily due to an extra week in fiscal 2015, and the prepared foods segment had an increase in sales volume primarily due to the acquisition and consolidation of hillshire brands in our final month of fiscal 2014 in addition to an extra week in fiscal 2015. the increase in sales volume was partially offset by a decrease in the beef and pork segments along with the divestitures of the mexico and brazil chicken operations in fiscal 2015.
â€¢   average sales price - sales were positively impacted by higher average sales prices, which accounted for an increase of $1.4 billion. the beef and prepared foods segments each had an increase in average sales prices, partially offset by a decrease in average sales prices in the chicken and pork segments. the increase in average sales price was largely due to continued tight domestic availability of beef products along with the change in mix in the prepared foods segment as a result of the acquisition and consolidation of hillshire brands in our final month of fiscal 2014.
2014 vs. 2013 -
â€¢   sales volume - sales were positively impacted by an increase in sales volume, which accounted for an increase of $679 million. all segments, with the exception of the beef segment, had an increase in sales volume. prepared foods contributed to the majority of the increase due to the acquisition and consolidation of hillshire brands in our final month of fiscal 2014.
â€¢   average sales price - sales were positively impacted by higher average sales price, which accounted for an increase of approximately $2.5 billion. beef, pork and prepared foods experienced increased average sales price, partially offset by decreased pricing in chicken. the increase in average sales price was largely due to continued tight domestic availability of protein, increased pricing associated with rising live and raw material costs, and improved mix. the majority of the increase was driven by the beef and pork segments.

â€¢   increase in raw material and other input costs in our prepared foods segment of approximately $210 million.
â€¢   increase due to net losses of $260 million in fiscal 2014, compared to net gains of approximately $5 million in fiscal 2013, from our beef and pork segment commodity risk management activities. these amounts exclude the impact from related physical purchase transactions, which mostly offset the losses.
â€¢   decrease in feed costs of $600 million in our chicken segment.
â€¢   the $610 million impact of higher sales volume was driven by increases in all of our segments, with the exception of beef. chicken and prepared foods contributed to the majority of the increase, with the prepared foods increase mainly attributable to the acquisition and consolidation of hillshire brands in our final month of fiscal 2014.

â€¢   cash interest expense primarily included interest expense related to the coupon rates for senior notes and term loans and commitment/letter of credit fees incurred on our revolving credit facilities. the increase in cash interest expense in fiscal 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to senior notes and term loans issued and debt assumed in connection with our completed acquisition of hillshire brands on august 28, 2014.
â€¢   non-cash interest expense primarily included amounts related to the amortization of debt issuance costs and discounts/premiums on note issuances, offset by interest capitalized. the decrease in non-cash interest expense in fiscal 2015 and 2014 is primarily due the reduction in non-cash interest expense on our 2013 notes which were retired in early fiscal 2014.

â€¢   average sales price - average sales price increased due to lower domestic availability of beef products.
â€¢   operating income - operating income decreased due to unfavorable market conditions associated with a decrease in supply which drove up fed cattle costs, export market disruptions, the relative value of competing proteins and increased operating costs. additionally, in fiscal 2015, we incurred $12 million in denison plant impairment and closure costs and $81 million of losses from mark-to-market open derivative positions and lower-of-cost-or-market inventory adjustments, which was mostly the result of a large and rapid decline in live cattle futures in september of fiscal 2015.
2014 vs. 2013 -
â€¢   sales volume - sales volume decreased due to a reduction in live cattle processed.
â€¢   average sales price - average sales price increased due to lower domestic availability of beef products.
â€¢   operating income - operating income increased due to improved operational execution and maximizing our revenues relative to the rising live cattle markets, partially offset by increased operating costs.
â€¢   derivative activities - operating results included net losses of $72 million in fiscal 2014, compared to net gains of $9 million in fiscal 2013 for commodity risk management activities related to futures contracts. these amounts exclude the impact from related physical sale and purchase transactions, which mostly offset the commodity risk management gains and losses.

2015 vs. 2014 -
â€¢   sales volume - sales volume increased due to incremental volumes from the acquisition of hillshire brands and an additional week in fiscal 2015.
â€¢   average sales price - average sales price increased primarily due to better product mix which was positively impacted by the acquisition of hillshire brands.
â€¢   operating income - operating income improved due to an increase in sales volume and average sales price mainly attributed to hillshire brands, as well as lower raw material costs of approximately $290 million for fiscal 2015 related to our legacy prepared foods business. profit improvement initiatives and hillshire brands synergies positively impacted prepared foods operating income by $285 million for fiscal 2015. additionally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we incurred $59 million in impairment charges associated with optimizing our prepared foods network.
2014 vs. 2013 -
â€¢   sales volume - sales volume increased as a result of improved demand for our prepared foods products and incremental volumes as a result of the acquisition of hillshire brands in our final month of fiscal 2014.
â€¢   average sales price - average sales price increased due to price increases associated with higher input costs along with better product mix which was positively impacted incrementally by the acquisition of hillshire brands in our final month of fiscal 2014.
â€¢   operating income - operating income decreased as a result of higher raw material and other input costs of approximately $210 million. because many of our sales contracts are formula based or shorter-term in nature, we are typically able to offset rising input costs through pricing. however, there is a lag time for price increases to take effect. additionally, operating income was reduced by $113 million due to additional costs associated with the prepared foods improvement plan, hillshire brands post-closing results, purchase price accounting adjustments and ongoing costs related to a legacy hillshire brands plant fire.

â€¢   other, net increase in fiscal 2015 is primarily driven by non-cash pension expense.
â€¢   cash flows associated with changes in operating assets and liabilities:
â€¢   2015 - increased primarily due to the decrease in inventory and accounts receivable balances and an increase in taxes payable, partially offset by the decrease in accounts payable. the decreased inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable balances were largely due to decreased raw material costs and timing of sales and payments.
â€¢   2014 - decreased primarily due to the increase in inventory and accounts receivable balances and decrease in income taxes payable, partially offset by the increase in accounts payable. the higher inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable balances are primarily attributable to significant increases in input costs and price increases associated with the increased input costs.
â€¢   2013 - decreased primarily due to a higher accounts receivable balance, partially offset by increases in accrued salaries, wages and benefits and income tax payable. the higher accounts receivable balance is largely due to significant increases in input costs and price increases associated with the increased input costs.

â€¢   the revolving credit facility supports our short-term funding needs and letters of credit. the letters of credit issued under this facility are primarily in support of leasing obligations and workers' compensation insurance programs. our maximum borrowing under the revolving credit facility during fiscal 2015 was $450 million.
â€¢   at october 3, 2015, we had current debt of $715 million, which we intend to repay with cash generated from our operating activities and other liquidity sources.
â€¢   we expect net interest expense will approximate $255 million for fiscal 2016.
â€¢   at october 3, 2015, approximately $270 million of our cash was held in the international accounts of our foreign subsidiaries. generally, we do not rely on the foreign cash as a source of funds to support our ongoing domestic liquidity needs. rather, we manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among our foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our foreign subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences or be subject to regulatory capital requirements; however, those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations. united states income taxes, net of applicable foreign tax credits, have not been provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. our intention is to reinvest the cash held by foreign subsidiaries permanently or to repatriate the cash only when it is tax efficient to do so.
â€¢   our current ratio was 1.52 to 1 and 1.64 to 1 at october 3, 2015, and september 27, 2014, respectively.

capital resources credit facility cash flows from operating activities and current cash on hand are our primary sources of liquidity for funding debt service, capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases. we also have a revolving credit facility, with a committed capacity of $1.25 billion, to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs, letters of credit and a source of financing for growth opportunities. as of october 3, 2015, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $6 million issued under this facility, none of which were drawn upon, which left $1,244 million available for borrowing. our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of 42 banks, with commitments ranging from $0.3 million to $85 million per bank. the syndicate includes bank holding companies that are required to be adequately capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency requirements.
capitalization to monitor our credit ratings and our capacity for long-term financing, we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors. we monitor the ratio of our net debt to ebitda as support for our long-term financing decisions. at october 3, 2015, and september 27, 2014, the ratio of our net debt to ebitda was 2.1x and 4.1x, respectively. refer to part ii, item 6, selected financial data, for an explanation and reconciliation to comparable gaap measures. the decrease in this ratio for fiscal 2015 is due to increased ebitda and the approximate $1.7 billion net debt reduction during fiscal 2015.
credit ratings
2016 notes on february 11, 2013, standard & poor's ratings services (s&p), upgraded the credit rating of the 2016 notes from "bbb-" to "bbb." this upgrade did not impact the interest rate on the 2016 notes.
on june 7, 2012, moody's investors service, inc. (moody's) upgraded the credit rating of the 2016 notes from "ba1" to "baa3." this upgrade decreased the interest rate on the 2016 notes from 6.85% to 6.60%, effective beginning with the six-month interest payment due october 1, 2012.
a one-notch downgrade by moody's would increase the interest rates on the 2016 notes by 0.25%. a two-notch downgrade from s&p would increase the interest rates on the 2016 notes by 0.25%.
revolving credit facility s&p's corporate credit rating for tyson foods, inc. is "bbb." moody's senior, unsecured, subsidiary guaranteed long-term debt rating for tyson foods, inc. is "baa3." fitch ratings' (fitch), issuer default rating for tyson foods, inc. is "bbb." the below table outlines the fees paid on the unused portion of the facility (facility fee rate) and letter of credit fees (undrawn letter of credit fee and borrowing spread) depending on the rating levels of tyson foods, inc. from s&p, moody's and fitch.

in the event the rating levels are split, the applicable fees and spread will be based upon the rating level in effect for two of the rating agencies, or, if all three rating agencies have different rating levels, the applicable fees and spread will be based upon the rating level that is between the rating levels of the other two rating agencies.
debt covenants our revolving credit and term loan facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens and encumbrances; incur debt; merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate; make acquisitions and investments; dispose of or transfer assets; change the nature of our business; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and enter into hedging transactions, in each case, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. in addition, we are required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum debt-to-capitalization ratios.
our senior notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens; engage in certain sale/leaseback transactions; and engage in certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.
we were in compliance with all debt covenants at october 3, 2015.
34
pension plans as further described in part ii, item 8, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 15: pension and other postretirement benefits, the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is defined as the amount the projected benefit obligation exceeds the plan assets. the funded status of the plans is an underfunded position of $410 million at the end of fiscal 2015 as compared to an underfunded position of $381 million at the end of fiscal 2014.
we expect to contribute approximately $63 million of cash to our pension plans in fiscal 2016 as compared to approximately $14 million in fiscal 2015 and $9 million in fiscal 2014. the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors, including minimum funding requirements. as a result, the actual funding in fiscal 2016 may be different from the estimate.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements material to our financial position or results of operations. the off-balance sheet arrangements we have are guarantees of debt of outside third parties, including leases and grower loans, and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. see part ii, item 8, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 20: commitments and contingencies for further discussion.

(2)   interest payments include interest on all outstanding debt. payments are estimated for variable rate and variable term debt based on effective interest rates at october 3, 2015, and expected payment dates.
(3)   amounts include guarantees of debt of outside third parties, which consist of leases and grower loans, all of which are substantially collateralized by the underlying assets, as well as residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. the amounts included are the maximum potential amount of future payments.
(4)   amounts include minimum lease payments under lease agreements.
(5)   amounts include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. the purchase obligations amount included items, such as future purchase commitments for grains, livestock contracts and fixed grower fees, that provide terms that meet the above criteria. for certain grain purchase commitments with a fixed quantity provision, we have assumed the future obligations under the commitment based on available commodity futures prices as published in observable active markets as of october 3, 2015. we have excluded future purchase commitments for contracts that do not meet these criteria. purchase orders are not included in the table, as a purchase order is an authorization to purchase and is cancelable. contracts for goods or services that contain termination clauses without penalty have also been excluded.
(6)   amounts include estimated amounts to complete buildings and equipment under construction as of october 3, 2015.
(7)   other long-term liabilities primarily consist of deferred compensation, deferred income, self-insurance, and asset retirement obligations. we are unable to reliably estimate the amount of these payments beyond fiscal 2016; therefore, we have only included the total liability in the table above. we also have employee benefit obligations consisting of pensions and other postretirement benefits of $495 million that are excluded from the table above. a discussion of the company's pension and postretirement plans, including funding matters, is included in part ii, item 8, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 15: pensions and other postretirement benefits.
in addition to the amounts shown above in the table, we have unrecognized tax benefits of $284 million and related interest and penalties of $46 million at october 3, 2015, recorded as liabilities.
the maximum contractual obligation associated with our cash flow assistance programs at october 3, 2015, based on the estimated fair values of the livestock supplier's net tangible assets on that date, aggregated to approximately $310 million. there were no receivables under these programs at october 3, 2015.
recently issued/adopted accounting pronouncements refer to the discussion under part ii, item 8, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2: recently issued accounting pronouncements for recently issued accounting pronouncements.

critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates. the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical.

marketing and advertising costs we incur advertising, retailer incentive and consumer incentive costs to promote products through marketing programs. these programs include cooperative advertising, volume discounts, in-store display incentives, coupons and other programs. marketing and advertising costs are charged in the period incurred. we accrue costs based on the estimated performance, historical utilization and redemption of each program. cash consideration given to customers is considered a reduction in the price of our products, thus recorded as a reduction to sales. the remainder of marketing and advertising costs is recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense.                  recognition of the costs related to these programs contains uncertainties due to judgment required in estimating the potential performance and redemption of each program. these estimates are based on many factors, including experience of similar promotional programs.                                                                                                                          we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our marketing accruals during the past three fiscal years. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our marketing accruals. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. a 10% change in our marketing accruals at october 3, 2015, would impact pretax earnings by approximately $19 million.

we use independent third-party actuaries to assist us in determining our pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost. we and the actuaries review assumptions that include estimates of the present value of the projected future pension payment to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. we accumulate and amortize the effect of actuarial gains and losses over future periods.   the key assumptions used in developing the required estimates include such factors as discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, retirement rates, and mortality. these assumptions can have a material impact upon the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, they are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore generally affect the net periodic benefit cost in future periods.
net periodic benefit costs for the defined benefit pension plans were $16 million in fiscal 2015. the projected benefit obligation was $1,986 million at the end of fiscal 2015. unrecognized actuarial losses were $100 million at the end of fiscal 2015. we currently expect net periodic benefit cost for fiscal 2016 to be approximately $35 million.                                                                                                                                            the discount rates were determined using a cash flow matching technique whereby the rates of a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities, were applied to the benefit obligations to determine the appropriate discount rate. in determining the long-term rate of return on plan assets, we first examined historical rates of return for the various asset classes within the plans. we then determined a long-term projected rate-of-return based on expected returns. investment, management and other fees paid out of plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality.   a 1% increase in the discount rate at october 3, 2015, would result in a decrease in the projected benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost of approximately $240 million and $5 million, respectively. a 1% decrease in the discount rate at october 3, 2015, would result in an increase in the projected benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost of approximately $298 million and $11 million, respectively.
plan assets are currently comprised of approximately 85% fixed income securities and 11% equity securities. fixed income securities can include, but are not limited to, direct bond investments and pooled or indirect bond investments. other investments may include, but are not limited to, international and domestic equities, real estate, commodities and private equity.                                                                                                                    it is reasonably likely that changes in external factors will result in changes to the assumptions used to measure pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost in future periods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   a 1% change in the return on plan assets at october 3, 2015, would impact the net periodic benefit cost by approximately $16 million.
we expect to contribute approximately $63 million of cash to our pension plans in fiscal 2016. the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors, including minimum funding requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                the risks of participating in multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans. the net pension cost of the multiemployer plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. assets contributed to such plans are not segregated or otherwise restricted to provide benefits only to our employees. the future cost of these plans is dependent on a number of factors including the funded status of the plans and the ability of the other participating companies to meet ongoing funding obligations.                                                                                                                                                                  the sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time with the remaining assumptions held constant. economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and that the effect of changes in assumptions are not necessarily linear.

federal income tax includes an estimate for taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries expected to be taxable upon remittance to the united states, except for earnings considered to be indefinitely invested in the foreign subsidiary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              changes in projected future earnings could affect the recorded valuation allowances in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            to the extent we prevail in matters for which unrecognized tax benefit liabilities have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our recorded unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. an unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and generally result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. a favorable tax settlement would generally be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution.
deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         our calculations related to income taxes contain uncertainties due to judgment used to calculate tax liabilities in the application of complex tax regulations across the tax jurisdictions where we operate.
valuation allowances are recorded when it is likely a tax benefit will not be realized for a deferred tax asset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      our analysis of unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties based on judgment used to apply the more likely than not recognition and measurement thresholds.
we record unrecognized tax benefit liabilities for known or anticipated tax issues based on our analysis of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
impairment of long-lived assets and definite life intangibles long-lived assets and definite life intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. examples include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use the asset, a change in its physical condition, or an unexpected change in financial performance. when evaluating long-lived assets and definite life intangibles for impairment, we compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated undiscounted future cash flows. an impairment is indicated if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset. for assets held for sale, we compare the carrying value of the disposal group to fair value. the impairment is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. we recorded impairment charges related to long-lived assets and definite life intangibles of $262 million, $107 million and $74 million, in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.                          our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to judgment in assumptions, including useful lives of assets, forecasted sales, operating margins, growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data that reflects the risk inherentin future cash flows to determine fairvalue.   we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate the impairment of long-lived assets or definite life intangibles during the last three fiscal years. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate impairments of long-lived assets or definite life intangibles. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated future cash flows, we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material.
we are conducting a project designed to optimize our network capacity and to enhance manufacturing efficiencies in the future. additionally, we continue to evaluate our international operations and strategies. if we have a significant change in strategies, outlook, or a manner in which we plan to use these assets, we may be exposed to future impairments.

impairment of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets description: goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary. if it is determined, based on qualitative factors, the fair value of the reporting unit may be more likely than not less than carrying amount or if significant changes to macro-economic factors related to the reporting unit have occurred that could materially impact fair value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. we can elect to forgo the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test.
the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed using a two-step process. the first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the quantitative impairment test is not necessary. however, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize, if any.
the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount, then goodwill is not considered impaired. however, if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination (i.e., the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was determined as the exit price a market participant would pay for the same business).
for indefinite life intangible assets, a qualitative assessment can also be performed to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates it is more likely than not an intangible asset is impaired. similar to goodwill, we can also elect to forgo the qualitative test for indefinite life intangible assets and perform the quantitative test. upon performing the quantitative test, if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. we elected to forgo the qualitative assessments on our indefinite life intangible assets for the fiscal 2015 impairment test.
we have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets. however, we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets prior to the required annual assessment if, among other things, we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization.
judgments and uncertainties: we estimate the fair value of our reporting units, using various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow analysis, which uses significant unobservable inputs, or level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. a discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates.
we include assumptions about sales, operating margins and growth rates which consider our budgets, business plans and economic projections, and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term business plan period. generally, we utilize normalized operating margin assumptions based on future expectations and operating margins historically realized in the reporting units' industries. for the fiscal 2015 impairment test of material reporting units, our beef and prepared foods reporting units utilized operating margins in future years in excess of the operating margin realized in the most recent year.
our beef reporting unit, which is our beef operating segment, had goodwill at october 3, 2015, totaling $676 million. we generally assumed operating margins in future years would be in our normalized range of 1.5% to 3%, as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in an exit transaction. had we assumed future operating margins consistent with those realized in the current fiscal year, we would have failed the first step of the annual impairment test, which would have required the second step to be performed and may have resulted in a material goodwill impairment loss. the current year beef reporting unit results were not indicative of future market participant expectations in an exit transaction, primarily due to unusual items in fiscal 2015 including unfavorable market conditions associated with a temporary decline in supply which drove up live cattle prices, export market disruptions, and losses from mark-to-market open derivative positions and lower-of-cost-or-market inventory adjustments due to a large and rapid decline in live cattle futures in september of fiscal 2015. to pass the first step of the annual impairment test in fiscal 2015, the beef reporting unit's projected operating margins had to average 1.2% (breakeven). although, the beef reporting unit's actual performance in fiscal 2015 was below this amount, it has performed above the 1.2% breakeven operating margin level in each of the previous six years and is expected to perform at or above this level in fiscal 2016. valuing the beef reporting unit utilizing projected operating margins averaging less than 1.2% (breakeven), or a 62% increase in the discount rate used in fiscal 2015, would have caused the carrying value of the beef reporting unit to be in excess of fair value, which would have required the second step to be performed.

our prepared foods reporting unit, which is our prepared foods operating segment, had goodwill at october 3, 2015, totaling $4,005 million. we generally assumed operating margins in future years would be in our expected range of 10% to 12%, as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in an exit transaction. had we assumed future operating margins consistent with those realized in the current fiscal year, we would have failed the first step of the annual impairment test, which would have required the second step to be performed and may have resulted in a material goodwill impairment loss. the current year prepared foods reporting unit results were not indicative of future market participant expectations in an exit transaction as we are still integrating hillshire brands into the reporting unit including capturing the full benefit of the expected synergies. as we proceed with the integration of hillshire brands, we realized synergies of $322 million in fiscal 2015 and expect to realize more than $500 million in fiscal 2016 and $700 million in fiscal 2017, of which the majority of these benefits will be realized in the prepared foods segment. to pass the first step of the annual impairment test in fiscal 2015, the prepared foods reporting unit's projected operating margins had to average 7.7% (breakeven). we exceeded the breakeven operating margin level for the second half of fiscal 2015 and expect to exceed it in fiscal 2016.
the fair value of our indefinite life intangible assets is calculated principally using relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings valuation approaches, which uses significant unobservable inputs, or level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy, and is believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. under these valuation approaches, we are required to make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data.
our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions: we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill and intangible assets during the last three years.
during fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, all of our material reporting units that underwent a quantitative test passed the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis and therefore, the second step was not necessary. in fiscal 2015, we recorded a $23 million full impairment of an immaterial reporting unit's goodwill.
some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets are outside the control of management, including interest rates, cost of capital, tax rates and credit ratings. while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite life intangibles, it is possible a material change could occur. if our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value, we may be required to perform the second step, which could result in additional material impairments of our goodwill.
all of our material reporting units' estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20% at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination. consequently, we do not currently consider any of our material reporting units at significant risk of failing the first step of the annual goodwill impairment test.
the discount rate used in our annual goodwill impairment test decreased to 6.8% in fiscal 2015 from 7.9% in fiscal 2014. discount rates continue to be low compared to historical levels. a 35% increase in the discount rate would have caused our prepared foods reporting unit, with $4,005 million of goodwill at october 3, 2015, to fail the first step of the goodwill impairment step and may have resulted in a material impairment upon completion of the second step.
we did not have material indefinite life intangible assets prior to the acquisition of hillshire brands in august 2014. our fiscal 2015 indefinite life intangible assets impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge. a 3.5% decrease in the fair value of an indefinite life intangible with a carrying value of $301 million, and a 16.5% decrease in the fair value of an indefinite life intangible with a carrying value of $2,175 million, would have caused their carrying value to exceed fair value. all other indefinite life intangible assets' estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20%.
the discount rate used in our annual indefinite life intangible assets impairment test was 8.0% in fiscal 2015. a 20% increase in the discount rate would have caused the carrying value of three intangible assets, which have a combined carrying value of $3,008 million, to exceed fair value.

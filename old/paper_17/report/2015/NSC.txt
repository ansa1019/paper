item 1a. risk factors we are subject to significant governmental legislation and regulation over commercial, operating and environmental matters.  congress can enact laws that could increase economic regulation of the industry. railroads presently are subject to commercial regulation by the surface transportation board (stb), which has jurisdiction over some rates, routes, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, and the extension or abandonment of rail lines.  the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers.  additional economic regulation of the rail industry by congress or the stb, whether under new or existing laws, could have a significant negative impact on our ability to determine prices for rail services and on the efficiency of our operations, either of which could result in a material adverse effect in the future on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.  this potential material adverse effect could also result in reduced capital spending on our rail network or abandonment of lines.
railroads are also subject to the enactment of laws by congress and regulation by the u.s. department of transportation and the u.s. department of homeland security (which regulate most aspects of our operations) related to safety and security. the rail safety improvement act of 2008 (rsia), the surface transportation extension act of 2015, and the implementing regulations promulgated by the federal railroad administration (fra) require us and each other class i railroad to implement an interoperable positive train control system (ptc) on certain of our respective lines by december 31, 2018.
k 11
full implementation of ptc in compliance with rsia will result in additional operating costs and capital expenditures, and ptc implementation may result in reduced operational efficiency and service levels, as well as increased compensation and benefits expenses, and increased claims and litigation costs.
our operations are subject to extensive federal and state environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air; discharges to waterways or groundwater supplies; handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and other materials; and the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases.  the risk of incurring environmental liability - for acts and omissions, past, present, and future - is inherent in the railroad business.  this risk includes property owned by us, whether currently or in the past, that is or has been subject to a variety of uses, including our railroad operations and other industrial activity by past owners or our past and present tenants.
environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, and we could incur environmental liabilities or costs, the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time, with respect to one or more of these properties.  moreover, lawsuits and claims involving other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time, and the resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.
as a common carrier by rail, we must offer to transport hazardous materials, regardless of risk. transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury and property (including environmental) damage, and compromise critical parts of our rail network.  a catastrophic rail accident involving hazardous materials could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity to the extent not covered by insurance. we have obtained insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and first-party property damages (see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements); however, insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or, if available, may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us.
we may be affected by terrorism or war.  any terrorist attack, or other similar event, any government response thereto, and war or risk of war could cause significant business interruption and may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.  because we play a critical role in the nation's transportation system, we could become the target of such an attack or have a significant role in the government's preemptive approach or response to an attack or war.
although we currently maintain insurance coverage for third-party liability arising out of war and acts of terrorism, we maintain only limited insurance coverage for first-party property damage and damage to property in our care, custody, or control caused by certain acts of terrorism.  in addition, premiums for some or all of our current insurance programs covering these losses could increase dramatically, or insurance coverage for certain losses could be unavailable to us in the future.
we may be affected by general economic conditions. prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions affecting the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter. economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more large customers could have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.
we may be affected by energy prices. volatility in energy prices could have an effect on a variety of items including, but not limited to: the economy; demand for transportation services; business related to the energy sector, including crude, natural gas, and coal; fuel prices; and fuel surcharges. any of these items could have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.
we may be affected by climate change legislation or regulation.  concern over climate change has led to significant federal, state, and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions.  moreover, even without such legislation or regulation, government incentives and adverse publicity k 12
relating to ghgs could affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry.  restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on ghg emissions, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase our operating costs, decrease the amount of traffic handled, and decrease the value of coal reserves we own, and thus could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.  such restrictions could affect our customers that (1) use commodities that we carry to produce energy, including coal, (2) use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry, or (3) manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy.
we face competition from other transportation providers.  we are subject to competition from motor carriers, railroads and, to a lesser extent, ships, barges, and pipelines, on the basis of transit time, pricing, and quality and reliability of service.  while we have used primarily internal resources to build or acquire and maintain our rail system, trucks and barges have been able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities.  any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the regions in which we operate, or legislation granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.
the operations of carriers with which we interchange may adversely affect our operations.  our ability to provide rail service to customers in the u.s. and canada depends in large part upon our ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to, among other matters, freight rates, revenue division, car supply and locomotive availability, data exchange and communications, reciprocal switching, interchange, and trackage rights. deterioration in the operations of or service provided by connecting carriers, or in our relationship with those connecting carriers, could result in our inability to meet our customers' demands or require us to use alternate train routes, which could result in significant additional costs and network inefficiencies.
we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations.  if we experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems, including computer hardware, software, and communications equipment, we could experience a service interruption, a security breach, or other operational difficulties.  additionally, if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or we are unable to implement new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service.  any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.
the vast majority of our employees belong to labor unions, and labor agreements, strikes, or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations.  more than 80% of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions.  if unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations.  additionally, future national labor agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements, could significantly increase our costs for healthcare, wages, and other benefits.  any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.
we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.  the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, commercial disputes, freight loss and other property damage, and other matters.  job-related personal injury and occupational claims are subject to the federal employer's liability act (fela), which is applicable only to railroads. fela's fault-based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault worker's compensation system.  the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded.
any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident involving any or all of freight loss  property damage, personal injury, and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity to the extent not covered by insurance.  we have obtained insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and first-party property damages (see note 16 to the consolidated financial k 13
statements); however, insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or, if available, may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us.
severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures.  severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena, including hurricanes, floods, fires, and earthquakes, may cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs, increased liabilities, and decreased revenues, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.
unpredictability of demand for rail services resulting in the unavailability of qualified personnel could adversely affect our operational efficiency and ability to meet demand.  workforce demographics, training requirements, and the availability of qualified personnel, particularly engineers and trainmen, could each have a negative impact on our ability to meet demand for rail service.  unpredictable increases in demand for rail services may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.
we may be affected by supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets or the nature of some of our supplier markets. we consumed approximately 487 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2015. fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations. a severe fuel supply shortage arising from production curtailments, increased demand in existing or emerging foreign markets, disruption of oil imports, disruption of domestic refinery production, damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure, political unrest, war or other factors, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter. also, such an event could impact us as well as our customers and other transportation companies.
due to the capital intensive nature, as well as the industry-specific requirements of the rail industry, high barriers of entry exist for potential new suppliers of core railroad items, such as locomotives and rolling stock equipment. additionally, we compete with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of locomotives and certain track and rolling stock materials. changes in the competitive landscapes of these limited-supplier markets could result in increased prices or significant shortages of materials that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.
the state of capital markets could adversely affect our liquidity.  from time-to-time we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements, including the issuance of long-term debt instruments and commercial paper, as well as the sale of certain receivables.  significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including the credit markets, or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or eliminate our access to, and/or significantly increase the cost of, various financing sources, including bank credit facilities and issuance of corporate bonds.  instability or disruptions of the capital markets and deterioration of our financial condition, alone or in combination, could also result in a reduction in our credit rating to below investment grade, which could prohibit or restrict us from accessing external sources of short- and long-term debt financing and/or significantly increase the associated costs.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations norfolk southern corporation and subsidiaries the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes and the selected financial data.
overview we are one of the nation's premier transportation companies.  our norfolk southern railway company subsidiary operates approximately 20,000 miles of road in 22 states and the district of columbia, serves every major container port in the eastern united states, and provides efficient connections to other rail carriers.  we operate the most extensive intermodal network in the east and are a major transporter of coal, automotive and industrial products.
we faced significant headwinds during 2015 as operating revenues were negatively impacted by the steep decline in energy prices, which drove both reduced fuel surcharge revenue and volume decreases in coal and energy-related products. despite these challenges we continued our focus on deploying resources to improve network velocity and service, while streamlining our corporate assets with the restructuring of our triple crown services company (tcs) subsidiary and the closure of our roanoke, virginia, corporate office. as a result of operational improvements, network fluidity improved throughout the year, as evidenced by a 21% decrease in terminal dwell from the beginning of the year and a 17% improvement in train speed over the same time period.
in 2016, we expect to see continued improvement in our service levels and the implementation of multiple cost-control initiatives, as we balance resources with the demand for our high-quality rail service. through these initiatives, we expect to produce expense savings of $130 million in 2016 while increasing productivity and efficiency. we also expect to see modest growth in our intermodal and automotive markets, which should help temper weakness in our commodity-related markets. however, further declines in commodity prices or consumer activity could erode demand. average revenue per unit is anticipated to benefit from pricing gains. improving our rail service, generating higher returns on capital, and increasing the efficiency of our resources remain our focus and we believe we are well-positioned to meet continued headwinds in 2016.
summarized results of operations
2015 compared with 2014
net income in 2015 was $1.6 billion, or $5.10 per diluted share, down $444 million, or 22%, compared with $2.0 billion, or $6.39 per diluted share, in 2014. the decrease in net income for the year reflected lower income from railway operations, down $691 million, or 19%, primarily due to a $1.1 billion, or 10%, decline in railway operating revenues as a result of lower average revenue per unit (driven primarily by reduced fuel surcharge revenues offset in part by price increases) and depressed coal volumes. this decline in revenues was partially offset by lower operating expenses (down $422 million, or 5%) resulting from the drop in oil prices, which significantly reduced fuel expense for the year, and by lower incentive compensation expense. these expense reductions were partially offset by $93 million of costs associated with the restructuring of our tcs subsidiary and the closure of our roanoke, virginia corporate office, which reduced net income by $58 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, and by higher wage rates.
2014 compared with 2013
net income in 2014 was $2.0 billion, or $6.39 per diluted share, up $90 million, or 5%, compared with
$1.9 billion, or $6.04 per diluted share, in 2013, as a 10% increase in income from railway operations was only partially offset by the absence of a gain from a land sale in michigan, which benefited net income by $60 million and earnings per share by $0.19 in 2013. railway operating revenues rose 3%, while operating expenses increased k 19
only 1%, driven largely by higher volume-related expenses that were offset in part by lower compensation and benefits costs and fuel prices.
detailed results of operations railway operating revenues railway operating revenues were $10.5 billion in 2015, $11.6 billion in 2014, and $11.2 billion in 2013.  the following table presents a three-year comparison of revenues, volumes, and average revenue per unit by market group.

revenues decreased $1.1 billion in 2015, and increased $379 million in 2014.  as reflected in the table below, the decline in 2015 resulted from lower average revenue per unit (a result of reduced fuel surcharge revenues, which were down $852 million, or 64%) and decreased volumes (primarily driven by continued weakness in the coal markets). the increase in 2014 resulted from higher volumes, partially offset by lower average revenue per unit as the effects of lower rates and changes in the mix of business more than offset higher fuel surcharges.

over 85% of our revenue base is covered by negotiated fuel surcharges, and revenues associated with these surcharges totaled $477 million, $1,329 million, and $1,254 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. fuel surcharge revenues are typically tied to either west texas intermediate crude oil (wti) or on-highway diesel (ohd). although less than half of our revenue base subject to fuel surcharges is tied to ohd, because wti price levels were below most of our surcharge trigger points during 2015, ohd accounted for about 85% of our fuel surcharge revenues. all of our wti-related fuel surcharge revenue and about 20% of our ohd-related fuel k 20
surcharge revenue is on a two-month lag. this two-month lag increased fuel surcharge revenues by $34 million and $84 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, but decreased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately $29 million in 2013. should the current fuel price environment persist in 2016, we expect fuel surcharge revenue to be lower than 2015.
two of our customers, dupont and sunbelt chlor alkali partnership (sunbelt), filed rate reasonableness complaints before the surface transportation board (stb) alleging that our tariff rates for transportation of regulated movements are unreasonable. since june 1, 2009, in the case of dupont, and april 1, 2011, in the case of sunbelt, we have been billing and collecting amounts based on the challenged tariff rates. in 2014, the stb resolved both rate reasonableness complaints in our favor. the stb's findings in the sunbelt case remain subject to technical corrections and requests for reconsideration.  both cases remain open to possible appeal. we believe the estimate of any reasonably possible loss will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. with regard to rate cases, we record adjustments to revenues in the periods if and when such adjustments are probable and estimable.
coal revenues decreased $559 million, or 23%, compared with 2014, reflecting a 16% decline in carload volume.  average revenue per unit was down 9%, primarily due to reduced fuel surcharge revenues, which lowered average revenue per unit by $134.
in 2014, coal revenues decreased $161 million, or 6%, compared with 2013, reflecting a 5% decrease in carload volume.  average revenue per unit was down 2%, the result of lower pricing (mainly export coal) and the negative effect of changes in mix.
for 2016, coal revenues are expected to decrease primarily due to lower volumes associated with continued weak demand.
coal represented 17% of our revenues in 2015, and 77% of shipments handled originated on our lines.  as shown in the following table, tonnage decreased in all markets.

utility coal tonnage was down 14% in 2015, compared with 2014.  the decrease primarily resulted from reduced coal burn due to significantly lower natural gas prices which caused utilities to shift from coal to natural gas generation as well as coal plant retirements (due to the mercury and air toxics standards implementation) and mild weather during the last half of 2015.
utility coal tonnage was down 3% in 2014 as compared with 2013. lower utility coal shipments to our northern region due to market share loss and competition from lower priced natural gas were offset in part by gains in our southern region, resulting from strong demand for electric generation and stockpile rebuilding after a harsh winter.
for 2016, we expect utility coal tonnage to decrease, as we expect lower demand resulting from high stockpiles due to mild weather and depressed natural gas prices.
k 21
export coal tonnage decreased 30% in 2015, compared with 2014.  competition faced by u.s. coal suppliers continued to increase as excess coal supply, a strong u.s. dollar, and depressed coal prices significantly reduced demand for u.s. export coal.  volume through norfolk was down 5.5 million tons, or 33%, and volume through baltimore was down 1.5 million tons, or 23%.
in 2014, export coal tonnage decreased 19%, compared with 2013. strong competition in the global metallurgical and thermal coal markets resulting from excess coal supply, weakening economies in the global market, and a strong australian currency advantage significantly reduced demand for u.s. export coal.  volume through norfolk was down 4.3 million tons, or 20%, and volume through baltimore was down 0.5 million tons, or 8%. other export volume decreased 0.6 million tons, or 85%.
for 2016, export coal tonnage is expected to decrease, as we expect continued pressure in the overseas coal markets due to oversupply, weak seaborne coal prices, and a strong u.s. dollar.
domestic metallurgical coal tonnage was down 10% in 2015, compared with 2014, and down 5% in 2014 as compared to 2013. both years reflect volume losses related to plant curtailments and sourcing shifts resulting from steel producers looking for opportunities to reduce costs that were offset in part by market share gains.
for 2016, domestic metallurgical coal tonnage is expected to remain relatively flat as customer-specific gains will be partially offset by volume decreases due to plant curtailments and sourcing shifts as we expect steel producers to continue to look for opportunities to reduce costs.
industrial coal tonnage dropped 5% in 2015, compared with 2014, as a result of natural gas conversions and decreased coal burn.
in 2014, industrial coal tonnage increased 16% compared with 2013, as new business opportunities with existing customers was partially offset by declines in anthracite and petcoke shipments.
for 2016, industrial coal tonnage is expected to remain flat due to reduced demand resulting from conversions to natural gas offset by additional business with existing customers.
general merchandise revenues in 2015 decreased $401 million, or 6%, compared with 2014, reflecting a 6% decline in average revenue per unit, the result of lower fuel surcharge revenues, which reduced average revenue per unit by $185 and offset the effects of higher rates. volume was relatively flat year over year.
in 2014, general merchandise revenues increased $362 million, or 6%, compared with 2013, reflecting 5% growth in carload volume and a 1% improvement in average revenue per unit that reflected favorable changes in fuel surcharge revenue and in mix.
for 2016, general merchandise revenues are expected to increase primarily due to pricing gains.
chemicals revenues in 2015 decreased 6%, compared with 2014, reflecting a 10% decrease in revenue per unit, driven by reduced fuel surcharge revenues and negative mix resulting from increased shipments of lower rated liquefied petroleum gas, which more than offset the effect of higher rates. volume grew 5%, largely driven by more shipments of liquefied petroleum gas and strong demand for shipments of polypropylene due to lower feedstock prices. these volume increases were partially offset by fewer shipments of crude oil from the bakken oil fields.
in 2014, chemicals revenues increased 12%, compared with 2013, reflecting volume growth (up 12%) largely driven by more shipments of crude oil from the bakken and canadian oil fields and growth in shipments of liquefied petroleum gas in the utica shale region.
for 2016, chemicals revenues are anticipated to increase, as average revenue per unit is expected to be higher, largely the effect of increased volumes of higher rated plastics and pricing gains.
k 22
agriculture, consumer products, and government revenues increased 1% in 2015, compared with 2014, the result of increased ethanol shipments due to higher gasoline consumption, offset in part by lower fuel surcharge revenues and fewer revenue shipments of empty rail cars as part of the conclusion of a hopper re-body program.
in 2014, agriculture, consumer products, and government revenues increased 2% compared with 2013, as a result of a 2% improvement in volume and a 1% improvement in average revenue per unit, due primarily to higher rates that were slightly offset by a negative change in mix.  the volume increase was driven by higher corn shipments due to increased demand for ethanol production, partially offset by fewer shipments of fertilizer due to production curtailments.
for 2016, agriculture, consumer products, and government revenues are expected to increase, as we expect average revenue per unit to be higher due to pricing gains. we also expect modest volume growth, supported by increased shipments of ethanol, fertilizer, food products, and feed products.
metals and construction revenues fell 17% in 2015, compared with 2014.  the decline resulted from a 10% drop in average revenue per unit, largely the result of lower fuel surcharge revenues partially offset by pricing gains, and a 7% decrease in carloads. the decline in carloads was the result of lower demand for materials used in the construction of pipe for drilling activity due to a drop in energy prices, fewer shipments of fractionating sand and ceramic proppant used in natural gas drilling, and declines in scrap metal and coil shipments, resulting from a decline in steel production due to global over-supply. these decreases were offset in part by increased shipments of aggregates as a result of higher demand in the southeast for project work and strong highway and construction related markets.
in 2014, metals and construction revenues grew 8% compared with 2013.  the revenue improvement resulted from a 9% increase in carloads, as we moved more shipments of fractionating sand for natural gas drilling, in addition to higher coil shipments to support growing demand in the automotive and energy sectors, and increased shipments of iron and steel as a result of higher import activity.
for 2016, metals and construction revenues are expected to benefit from increased average revenue per unit due to pricing gains. we expect volumes to be relatively flat as construction-related gains are expected to be offset by declines in the steel market.
automotive revenues fell 3% compared to 2014, reflecting an 8% drop in average revenue per unit, due primarily to lower fuel surcharge revenues, offset in part by rate increases. volume grew 5% due to increased production of north american light vehicles and the return of shipments diverted in 2014 due to improved service in the second half of 2015.
in 2014, automotive revenues rose 2% compared to 2013, reflecting 2% growth in volume due to increased vehicle production at plants we serve that was offset in part by the diversion of shipments to other modes of transportation as a result of equipment shortages and network delays.
for 2016, automotive revenues are expected to increase as a result of volume gains due to continued increases in domestic production as well as higher average revenue per unit as a result of improved pricing.
paper, clay and forest products revenues were down 3%, as average revenue per unit decreased 2%, and volumes fell 1%. the decline in average revenue per unit was driven primarily by lower fuel surcharge revenues and negative mix (fewer higher rated kaolin shipments) offset by pricing gains. volume changes reflected lower waste, kaolin, woodchip, and graphic paper volumes as a result of customer sourcing changes, softened demand, and mill closures, offset by higher carloads of pulpboard, lumber, and pulp due to continued recovery of the housing market.
in 2014, paper, clay and forest products revenues were flat compared with 2013 as a 2% improvement in average revenue per unit (reflecting pricing gains and positive mix) was offset by a 2% decrease in volumes.  volume declines were driven by reduced shipments of municipal solid waste resulting from loss of business, lower k 23
shipments of newsprint and paper due to mill and plant closures, and fewer pulp shipments due to production issues and reduced export demand. these declines were offset in part by higher lumber shipments resulting from the continued housing recovery and new business.
for 2016, paper, clay, and forest products revenues are anticipated to increase due to modest improvement in volumes and revenue per unit. volume growth is expected to be driven by higher woodchip and lumber shipments, as we anticipate growth in demand for wood pellets and the continued recovery of the housing market, offset in part by lower municipal solid waste due to the loss of a customer, and lower kaolin and graphic paper shipments due to demand declines.
intermodal revenues decreased $153 million, or 6%, compared with 2014, reflecting decreased revenue per unit of 6% (the result of lower fuel surcharge revenues, which decreased average revenue per unit by $51).
domestic volume (including truckload and intermodal marketing companies, tcs, and premium business) declined 3%, a result of the restructuring of the tcs subsidiary, ongoing service challenges during the first three quarters, an increase in available trucking capacity, and weaker overall demand, all partially offset by growth from continued highway-to-rail conversions. international volume grew 6% due to stronger demand from existing customers and new business.
in 2014, intermodal revenues increased $178 million, or 7%, compared with 2013, reflecting a 8% growth in volume.  domestic volume improved 6%, a result of growth in strategic corridors, continued highway-to-rail conversions, and higher demand for rail service from existing customers.  international volume grew 10% due to increased demand from existing customers and expanded service opportunities.
for 2016, we anticipate higher intermodal revenues due to increased volumes as a result of continued highway conversions and growth associated with new and existing customers to be partially offset by declines due to the restructuring of the tcs subsidiary and an increase in available trucking capacity. average revenue per unit is expected to be lower as pricing gains are offset by unfavorable changes in business mix, primarily a result of the tcs restructuring, and reduced fuel surcharge revenue.
in connection with the tcs restructuring discussed above, we are working with our customers and business partners to convert business handled by tcs into our current intermodal network. as this transition occurs, we expect some shipments previously handled by tcs to be absorbed by our domestic container line of business. while it is likely that not all of this tcs business will make this transition, we do not expect this restructuring to have a material effect on our railway operating revenues or income from railway operations.
railway operating expenses railway operating expenses in 2015 were $7.6 billion, down $422 million, or 5%, compared to 2014.  expenses in 2014 were $8.0 billion, up $61 million, or 1%, compared to 2013.  in 2015, decreases in fuel costs and incentive compensation were offset in part by costs associated with the tcs restructuring and closure of our roanoke, virginia corporate office, in addition to higher wage rates. in 2014, increases in volume-related costs were offset in part by lower postretirement and pension benefit costs as well as lower fuel prices.

fuel expense, which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used in railway operations, decreased $640 million, or 41%, in 2015 and decreased $39 million, or 2%, in 2014.  both declines were principally the result of lower locomotive fuel prices (down 40% in 2015 and 6% in 2014). locomotive fuel consumption decreased 1% in 2015, but increased 4% in 2014. we consumed approximately 487 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2015, compared with 494 million gallons in 2014 and 476 million gallons in 2013.
looking forward to 2016, we expect lower fuel expenses as current prices for locomotive fuel are significantly below the average cost per gallon of $1.74 experienced in 2015. in addition, we anticipate the tcs restructuring and improved fuel productivity will benefit fuel expense in 2016.
compensation and benefits, which represents 38% of total operating expenses, increased $14 million in 2015 reflecting changes in:
•   pay rates (up $83 million),
•   payroll taxes (up $37 million),
•   labor agreement payments ($24 million),
•   employee levels, including overtime and increased trainees (up $21 million), and
•   incentive compensation (down $151 million).
in 2014, compensation and benefits decreased $105 million, or 3%, reflecting changes in:
•   postretirement and pension benefit costs (down $152 million),
•   health and welfare benefit costs (down $25 million),
•   pay rates (up $57 million), and
•   payroll taxes (up $21 million).
our employment averaged 30,456 in 2015, compared with 29,482 in 2014, and 30,103 in 2013. looking forward to 2016, we expect normalized levels of incentive compensation in addition to increased medical cost inflation and higher wages to be offset in part by lower employment levels driven from operational efficiencies and the tcs restructuring.

materials and other expenses increased $36 million, or 4%, in 2015, and increased $112 million, or 14%, in 2014, as shown in the following table.

the increase in other costs in 2015 reflected higher relocation costs driven by the roanoke, virginia corporate office closure, increased travel costs for train service employees and higher property taxes. casualties and other claims expenses include the estimates of costs related to personal injury (pi), property damage, and environmental matters. the increase in 2015 was driven by less favorable pi reserve adjustments for prior years' claim amounts offset in part by reduced environmental remediation costs as a result of less unfavorable development for our environmental liability.
volume growth in 2014 drove increases in locomotive and equipment maintenance and repair costs. additionally, harsh winter weather experienced in the first quarter of 2014 resulted in increased maintenance activity, which negatively impacted the comparison to 2013. the increase in casualties and other claims expenses in 2014 reflected lower favorable pi reserve adjustments for prior years' claim amounts.
purchased services and rents includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors, including the net costs of operating joint (or leased) facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals.  this category of expenses increased $65 million, or 4%, in 2015, and increased $58 million, or 4%, in 2014.
2015                                              2014                2013

total                   $1,752              $1,687              $1,629
the increase in 2015 for purchased services expense reflects higher costs associated with intermodal operations, information technology, maintenance and repair, and the roanoke, virginia corporate office closure. these increases were partially offset by tcs restructuring-related savings. the increase in 2014 for purchased services expense resulted from higher volumes and the effect reduced network velocity had on intermodal operations and joint facilities costs. additionally, higher maintenance and repair costs were offset in part by reduced expenses associated with the shared asset areas (including equity in the earnings of conrail, see note 5).
equipment rents, which includes our cost of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to us for the use of our equipment, increased in 2015 principally due to higher automotive and intermodal rates and volumes. the 2014 increase is a result of higher volumes and network congestion.
k 26
looking forward to 2016, we expect decreases in our purchased services and equipment rents expenses principally due to lower tcs operational costs and improved network velocity. these decreases will be partially offset by higher intermodal operations costs associated with higher conventional volumes.
depreciation expense increased by $103 million, or 11%, in 2015, and increased by $35 million, or 4%, in 2014. the increase in 2015 is due in part to the recognition of $63 million of accelerated depreciation on tcs assets as a result of our tcs restructuring. both periods also reflect growth in our roadway and equipment capital base as we continue to invest in our infrastructure and rolling stock.
other income - net other income - net was $103 million in 2015, $104 million in 2014, and $233 million in 2013 (note 2). the decrease in 2015 reflects decreased returns from corporate-owned life insurance, declines in coal royalties and higher professional and consultant fees, offset in part from higher gains from sales of property (including income earned from joint ventures). the decrease in 2014 reflects the absence of the 2013 michigan land sale ($97 million).
income taxes income tax expense in 2015 was $886 million, an effective rate of 36.3%, compared with 36.2% in 2014 and 35.6% in 2013. all three years benefited from favorable reductions in deferred tax expense for state law changes and certain business tax credits.
irs examinations have been completed for all years prior to 2013. we are not currently under audit by the internal revenue service.
financial condition, liquidity, and capital resources cash provided by operating activities, our principal source of liquidity, was $2.9 billion in 2015 and 2014, and $3.1 billion in 2013. lower cash from operations in 2015 compared with 2014 was offset by reduced tax payments. the decrease in 2014 reflected increased tax payments, offset in part by improved operating results. we had working capital of $402 million at december 31, 2015, compared with $998 million at december 31, 2014, primarily reflecting higher current maturities of long-term debt.  cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.1 billion and $973 million at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and were invested in accordance with our corporate investment policy as approved by the board of directors.  the portfolio contains securities that are subject to market risk.  there are no limits or restrictions on our access to these assets.  we expect cash on hand combined with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our ongoing obligations.

cash used in investing activities was $2.1 billion in 2015, compared with $2.0 billion in 2014, and $1.9 billion in 2013.  the increase in 2015 primarily reflected higher cash outflows for property additions, which were partially offset by higher proceeds from coli activity. the increase in 2014 primarily reflected increased use of cash for property additions and coli investments, which were partially offset by higher short-term investment maturities.
on september 18, 2015, we completed the acquisition of 282 miles of the delaware and hudson railway co. (d&h) line between sunbury, pennsylvania and schenectady, new york, for $215 million. the transaction is included in property additions on the statement of cash flows. the acquisition comprises land ($49 million), roadway, including bridges, tunnels, grading, rail, cross ties and other track material ($162 million), and other property including supplies ($4 million). the acquired lines connect with our network at sunbury, pennsylvania, and binghamton, new york, and provide us single-line routes from chicago and the southeastern united states to albany, new york, and our intermodal terminals in scranton, pennsylvania and mechanicville, new york. we also gain an enhanced connection to our pan am southern llc joint venture, which serves new england markets. we previously provided service over the d&h lines via trackage rights and haulage agreements. in addition, we hired, trained and qualified 152 former d&h employees.

for 2016, we have budgeted $2.1 billion for property additions.  the anticipated spending includes $820 million for the normalized replacement of rail, ties, and ballast, and the improvement or replacement of bridges.  planned equipment spending of $490 million includes new and rebuilt locomotives, intermodal containers and chassis, mill gondolas, multilevel automobile racks, and covered hoppers.  investments in facilities and terminals are anticipated to be $220 million and include terminals and equipment to add capacity to our intermodal network, new or expanded bulk transfer facilities, improvements to vehicle distribution facilities, and upgrades and expansions of our mechanical service shops.  for 2016, we have budgeted $250 million for the continued implementation of positive train control (ptc) and expect ptc-related property additions in 2017 and 2018 to total approximately $530 million.  we also expect to spend $90 million on infrastructure improvements to increase mainline capacity, create operating savings, and to accommodate business growth. technology investments of $80 million are planned for new or upgraded systems and computers.
cash used in financing activities was $662 million in 2015, compared with $1.3 billion in 2014, and $394 million in 2013.  the decrease in 2015 was driven primarily by higher proceeds from borrowing and lower debt repayments, partially offset by higher share repurchase activity (see note 14).  the increase in 2014 was driven primarily by higher debt repayments and lower debt proceeds, partially offset by reduced share repurchase activity.

share repurchases totaled $1.1 billion in 2015, $318 million in 2014, and $627 million in 2013 for the purchase and retirement of 11.3 million, 3.1 million, and 8.3 million shares, respectively.  on august 1, 2012, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 50 million shares of common stock through december 31, 2017, and 23.9 million shares remain under this authority as of december 31, 2015.  the timing and volume of future share repurchases will be guided by our assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors.  any near-term purchases under the program are expected to be made with internally generated cash, cash on hand, or proceeds from borrowings.
we further discuss our current securities issuance authority from our board of directors, our credit agreement, and our accounts receivable securitization program in note 8 of our notes to consolidated financial statements, all of which provide for access to additional liquidity should the need arise. our debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 45.3% at december 31, 2015, compared with 42.0% at december 31, 2014.
upcoming annual debt maturities are relatively modest (note 8).  overall, our goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support our business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles.
application of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  these estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, and future events are likely to occur that may require us to make changes to these estimates and assumptions.  accordingly, we regularly review these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in the business environment, and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  we regularly discuss the development, selection, and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors.
pensions and other postretirement benefits accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires us to make several estimates and assumptions (note 11).  these include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans' assets, projected increases in medical costs, and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality.  in addition, the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value.  we make these estimates based on our historical experience and other information that we deem pertinent under the circumstances (for example, expectations of future stock market performance).  we utilize an independent actuarial consulting firm's studies to assist us in selecting appropriate actuarial assumptions and valuing related liabilities.
net pension expense, which is included in "compensation and benefits" in the consolidated statements of income, was $34 million for 2015.  in recording this amount, we assumed a long-term investment rate of return of 8.25%, which was supported by the long-term total rate of return on plan assets since inception, as well as our expectation of future returns.  a one-percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a $20 million change in pension expense.  we review assumptions related to our defined benefit plans annually, and while changes are likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age, projected earnings, and mortality, they are not expected to have a material effect on our net pension expense or net pension liability in the future. the net pension liability is recorded at net present value using discount rates that are based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments.  we utilize analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans are matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds.  we use the results of the yield curve analyses to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans.
k 30
net benefit for other postretirement benefits, which is also included in "compensation and benefits," was $15 million for 2015. historically, medical inflation has been a significant component of the estimate for postretirement benefits, however, its effect has been reduced substantially due to the plan amendment made in 2014 (note 11).  since there is a fixed benefit for medicare-eligible retirees, there is no medical inflation assumed for this population.  the medical inflation factor is still applicable for pre-medicare-eligible retirees.
properties and depreciation most of our total assets are long-lived railway properties (note 6).  as disclosed in note 1, properties are depreciated using group depreciation.  the primary depreciation method for our asset base is group life.  units of production is the principal method of depreciation for rail in high density corridors and for depletion of natural resources.  remaining properties are depreciated generally using the straight-line method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives. see note 1 for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates in this area.
depreciation expense for 2015 totaled $1,054 million.  our composite depreciation rates for 2015 are disclosed in note 6; a one-tenth percentage point increase (or decrease) in these rates would have resulted in a $38 million increase (or decrease) to depreciation expense.  for 2015, roadway depreciation rates ranged from 0.83% to 33.33% and equipment depreciation rates ranged from 1.55% to 33.33%.
personal injury, environmental, and legal liabilities casualties and other claims expense, included in "materials and other" in the consolidated statements of income, consists primarily of our accrual for personal injury liabilities and environmental remediation costs.
to aid in valuing our personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during each period, we utilize studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm.  the actuarial firm studies our historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements, taking into account relevant outside influences. we adjust the liability quarterly based upon our assessment and the results of the study. our estimate is subject to inherent limitation given the difficulty of predicting future events and as such the ultimate loss sustained may vary from the estimated liability recorded.
we are subject to various jurisdictions' environmental laws and regulations.  we record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably.  environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates. additionally, our environmental policy council (composed of senior managers) oversees and interprets our environmental policy. operating expenses, included in "materials and other" and "purchased services and rents," for environmental matters totaled $40 million in 2015, $45 million in 2014, and $57 million in 2013, and property additions for environmental matters were not significant.
we and/or certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations. when we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, it is accrued through a charge to earnings.
for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates in accounting for personal injury and environmental matters see note 16.
income taxes our net long-term deferred tax liability totaled $9.1 billion at december 31, 2015 (note 3).  this liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements.  after application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in our income tax returns.  for state income and other taxes, judgment is also required k 31
with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions. a valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. we had a $35 million valuation allowance on $603 million of deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2015, reflecting the expectation that almost all of these assets will be realized.
in addition, we have a recorded liability for our estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and, if so, judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority.  we believe this liability for uncertain tax positions to be adequate.  income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded.  for every one half percent change in the 2015 effective tax rate, net income would have changed by $12 million.
other matters labor agreements more than 80% of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions.  pursuant to the railway labor act, these agreements remain in effect until new agreements are reached, or until the bargaining procedures mandated by the act are completed.  we largely bargain nationally in concert with other major railroads, represented by the national carriers conference committee (nccc).  moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and unions may propose changes to the agreements.
on or after november 1, 2014, the nccc and the various unions exchanged new proposals to begin this round of national negotiations.  the unions have formed three separate bargaining coalitions and negotiations are ongoing with all three coalitions.  in the case of the transportation communications union led coalition, the negotiations are being assisted by mediators from the national mediation board.  separately, in january 2015 we reached an agreement covering wages and work rules through 2019 with the brotherhood of locomotive engineers and trainmen (blet) which represents approximately 4,600 of our locomotive engineers.  changes to the blet benefit plan will be bargained nationally through the nccc.
market risks we manage overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed- and floating-rate debt instruments. at december 31, 2015, debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled $200 million. a one-percentage point increase in interest rates would increase total annual interest expense related to all variable debt by approximately $2 million. we consider it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

inflation in preparing financial statements, gaap requires the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property.  as a capital-intensive company, we have most of our capital invested in long-lived assets.  the replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost.

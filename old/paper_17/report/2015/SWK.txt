item 1a. risk factors the company's business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties. you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10-k, including those risks set forth under the heading entitled "cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995", and in other documents that the company files with the u.s. securities and exchange commission, before making any investment decision with respect to its securities. if any of the risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop, the company's business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could change. under these circumstances, the trading prices of the company's securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment in the company's securities.
changes in customer preferences, the inability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with large customers, inventory reductions by customers, and the inability to penetrate new channels of distribution could adversely affect the company's business.
the company has certain significant customers, particularly home centers and major retailers, although no single customer represented more than 10% of consolidated net sales in 2015. however, the two largest customers comprised nearly 18% of net sales, with u.s. and international mass merchants and home centers collectively comprising approximately 27% of net sales. the loss or material reduction of business, the lack of success of sales initiatives, or changes in customer preferences or loyalties, for the company's products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the company's results of operations and cash flows. in addition, the company's major customers are volume purchasers, a few of which are much larger than the company and have strong bargaining power with suppliers. this limits the ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices. furthermore, unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on sales.
if customers in the convergent security solutions ("css") business are dissatisfied with services and switch to competitive services, or disconnect for other reasons such as preference for digital technology products or other technology enhancements not then offered by css, the company's attrition rates may increase. in periods of increasing attrition rates, recurring revenue and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. the risk is more pronounced in times of economic uncertainty, as customers may reduce amounts spent on the products and services the company provides.
in times of tough economic conditions, the company has experienced significant distributor inventory corrections reflecting de-stocking of the supply chain associated with difficult credit markets. such distributor de-stocking exacerbated sales volume declines pertaining to weak end user demand and the broader economic recession. the company's results may be adversely impacted in future periods by such customer inventory adjustments. further, the inability to continue to penetrate new channels of distribution may have a negative impact on the company's future results.
the company faces active global competition and if it does not compete effectively, its business may suffer.
the company faces active competition and resulting pricing pressures. the company's products compete on the basis of, among other things, its reputation for product quality, its well-known brands, price, innovation and customer service capabilities. the company competes with both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses. these companies are often located in countries such as china, taiwan and india where labor and other production costs are substantially lower than in the u.s., canada and western europe. also, certain large customers offer house brands that compete with some of the company's product offerings as a lower-cost alternative. to remain profitable and defend market share, the company must maintain a competitive cost structure, develop new products and services, lead product innovation, respond to competitor innovations and enhance its existing products in a timely manner. the company may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts and with all of its competitors, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profit margins.
sfs is a continuous operational improvement process applied to many aspects of the company's business such as procurement, quality in manufacturing, maximizing customer fill rates, integrating acquisitions and other key business processes. in the event
7
the company is not successful in effectively applying the sfs disciplines to its key business processes, including those of acquired businesses, its ability to compete and future earnings could be adversely affected.
in addition, the company may have to reduce prices on its products and services, or make other concessions, to stay competitive and retain market share. price reductions taken by the company in response to customer and competitive pressures, as well as price reductions and promotional actions taken to drive demand that may not result in anticipated sales levels, could also negatively impact its business. the company engages in restructuring actions, sometimes entailing shifts of production to low-cost countries, as part of its efforts to maintain a competitive cost structure. if the company does not execute restructuring actions well, its ability to meet customer demand may decline, or earnings may otherwise be adversely impacted; similarly if such efforts to reform the cost structure are delayed relative to competitors or other market factors the company may lose market share and profits.
customer consolidation could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.
a significant portion of the company's products are sold through home centers and mass merchant distribution channels in the u.s. and europe. a consolidation of retailers in both north america and abroad has occurred over time and the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates risk of exposure to potential volume loss. the loss of certain larger home centers as customers would have a material adverse effect on the company's business until either such customers were replaced or the company made the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of business.
low demand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new products at favorable margins could adversely impact the company's performance and prospects for future growth.
the company's competitive advantage is due in part to its ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins. the uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products, such as market demand and costs of development and production may impede the successful development and introduction of new products on a consistent basis. introduction of new technology may result in higher costs to the company than that of the technology replaced. that increase in costs, which may continue indefinitely or until and if increased demand and greater availability in the sources of the new technology drive down its cost could adversely affect the company's results of operations. market acceptance of the new products introduced in recent years and scheduled for introduction in future years may not meet sales expectations due to various factors, such as the failure to accurately predict market demand, end-user preferences, and evolving industry standards. moreover, the ultimate success and profitability of the new products may depend on the company's ability to resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and cost-effective manner, and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies. the company's investments in productive capacity and commitments to fund advertising and product promotions in connection with these new products could erode profits if those expectations are not met.
the company's brands are important assets of its businesses and violation of its trademark rights by imitators, or the failure of its licensees or vendors to comply with the company's product quality, manufacturing requirements, marketing standards, and other requirements could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation.
the company's trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are important to its success and competitive position. unauthorized use of the company's trademark rights may not only erode sales of the company's products, but may also cause significant damage to its brand name and reputation, interfere with its ability to effectively represent the company to its customers, contractors, suppliers, and/or licensees, and increase litigation costs. similarly, failure by licensees or vendors to adhere to the company's standards of quality and other contractual requirements could result in loss of revenue, increased litigation, and/or damage to the company's reputation and business. there can be no assurance that the company's ongoing efforts to protect its brand and trademark rights and ensure compliance with its licensing and vendor agreements will prevent all violations.
successful sales and marketing efforts depend on the company's ability to recruit and retain qualified employees.
the success of the company's efforts to grow its business depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives, its sales force and other personnel, including the ability of its sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage. the company must therefore continue to recruit, retain and motivate management, sales and other personnel sufficiently to maintain its current business and support its projected growth. a shortage of these key employees might jeopardize the company's ability to implement its growth strategy.
8
the company has significant operations outside of the united states, which are subject to political, economic and other risks inherent in operating outside of the united states.
the company generates a significant portion of its total revenue outside of the united states. business operations outside of the united states are subject to political, economic and other risks inherent in operating in certain countries, such as:
•   the difficulty of enforcing agreements and protecting assets through legal systems outside the u.s.;
•   managing widespread operations and enforcing internal policies and procedures such as compliance with u.s. and foreign anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations;
•   trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;
•   the application of certain labor regulations outside of the united states;
•   compliance with a wide variety of non-u.s. laws and regulations;
•   changes in the general political and economic conditions in the countries where the company operates, particularly in emerging markets;
•   the threat of nationalization and expropriation;
•   increased costs and risks of doing business in a wide variety of jurisdictions;
•   government controls limiting importation of goods;
•   government controls limiting payments to suppliers for imported goods;
•   limitations on repatriation of earnings; and
•   exposure to wage, price and capital controls.
changes in the political or economic environments in the countries in which the company operates could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
the company's business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing overseas.
the company imports large quantities of finished goods, component parts and raw materials. substantially all of its import operations are subject to customs requirements and to tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements, bilateral actions or, in some cases unilateral action. in addition, the countries in which the company's products and materials are manufactured or imported may from time to time impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions on its imports (including restrictions on manufacturing operations) or adversely modify existing restrictions. imports are also subject to unpredictable foreign currency variation which may increase the company's cost of goods sold. adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions, or the company's suppliers' failure to comply with customs regulations or similar laws, could harm the company's business.
the company's operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement, and the activities and regulations of the world trade organization. although these trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade liberalization, sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by reducing or eliminating the duties and/or quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country, trade agreements can also impose requirements that adversely affect the company's business, such as setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into key markets including the u.s. or the european union, or making it easier for other companies to compete, by eliminating restrictions on products from countries where the company's competitors source products.
the company's ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the u.s. and other countries. these issues could delay importation of products or require the company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers. these alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on the company's business and financial condition.
the company's success depends on its ability to improve productivity and streamline operations to control or reduce costs.
the company is committed to continuous productivity improvement and evaluating opportunities to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and eliminate excess capacity. the company has undertaken restructuring actions, the savings of which may be mitigated by many factors, including economic weakness, competitive pressures, and decisions to increase
9
costs in areas such as sales promotion or research and development above levels that were otherwise assumed. failure to achieve or delays in achieving projected levels of efficiencies and cost savings from such measures, or unanticipated inefficiencies resulting from manufacturing and administrative reorganization actions in progress or contemplated, would adversely affect the company's results.
the performance of the company may suffer from business disruptions associated with information technology, cyber attacks, system implementations, or catastrophic losses affecting distribution centers and other infrastructure.
the company relies heavily on computer systems to manage and operate its businesses, and record and process transactions. computer systems are important to production planning, customer service and order fulfillment among other business-critical processes. consistent and efficient operation of the computer hardware and software systems is imperative to the successful sales and earnings performance of the various businesses in many countries.
despite efforts to prevent such situations, insurance policies and loss control and risk management practices that partially mitigate these risks, the company's systems may be affected by damage or interruption from, among other causes, power outages, system failures or computer viruses. computer hardware and storage equipment that is integral to efficient operations, such as e-mail, telephone and other functionality, is concentrated in certain physical locations in the various continents in which the company operates.
further, security threats and sophisticated computer crime pose a potential risk to the security of the company's information technology systems, networks, services and assets, as well as the confidentiality and integrity of the company's data. if the company suffers a loss or disclosure of business or stakeholder information due to security breaches, and business continuity plans do not effectively address these issues on a timely basis, the company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage operations as well as reputational, competitive or business harm, which may adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition.
in addition, the company is in the process of system conversions to sap as well as other applications to provide a common platform across most of its businesses. there can be no assurances that expected expense synergies will be achieved or that there will not be delays to the expected timing of such synergies. it is possible the costs to complete the system conversions may exceed current expectations, and that significant costs may be incurred that will require immediate expense recognition as opposed to capitalization. the risk of disruption to key operations is increased when complex system changes such as the sap conversions are undertaken. if systems fail to function effectively, or become damaged, operational delays may ensue and the company may be forced to make significant expenditures to remedy such issues. any significant disruption in the company's computer operations could have a material adverse impact on its business and results.
the company's operations are significantly dependent on infrastructure, notably certain distribution centers and security alarm monitoring facilities, which are concentrated in various geographic locations. if any of these were to experience a catastrophic loss, such as a fire, earthquake, hurricane, or flood, it could disrupt operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. the company maintains business interruption insurance, but it may not fully protect the company against all adverse effects that could result from significant disruptions.
unforeseen events, including war, terrorism and other international conflicts and public health issues, whether occurring in the united states or abroad, could disrupt the company's operations, disrupt the operations of its suppliers or customers, or result in political or economic instability. these events could reduce demand for its products and make it difficult or impossible for the company to manufacture its products, deliver products to customers, or to receive materials from suppliers.
the company's results of operations could be negatively impacted by inflationary or deflationary economic conditions which could affect the ability to obtain raw materials, component parts, freight, energy, labor and sourced finished goods in a timely and cost-effective manner.
the company's products are manufactured using both ferrous and non-ferrous metals including, but not limited to, steel, zinc, copper, brass, aluminum, and nickel. additionally, the company uses other commodity-based materials for components and packaging including, but not limited to, plastics, resins, wood and corrugated products. the company's cost base also reflects significant elements for freight, energy and labor. the company also sources certain finished goods directly from vendors. if the company is unable to mitigate any inflationary increases through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives, its profitability may be adversely affected.
conversely, in the event there is deflation, the company may experience pressure from its customers to reduce prices; there can be no assurance that the company would be able to reduce its cost base (through negotiations with suppliers or other measures) to offset any such price concessions which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows.
10
further, as a result of inflationary or deflationary economic conditions, the company believes it is possible that a limited number of suppliers may either cease operations or require additional financial assistance from the company in order to fulfill their obligations. in a limited number of circumstances, the magnitude of the company's purchases of certain items is of such significance that a change in established supply relationships with suppliers or increase in the costs of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions, delays, inefficiencies or an inability to market products. changes in value-added tax rebates, currently available to the company or to its suppliers, could also increase the costs of the company's manufactured products as well as purchased products and components and could adversely affect the company's results.
uncertainty about the financial stability of economies outside the u.s. could have a significant adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations and financial condition.
the company generates approximately 47% of its revenues from outside the u.s., including 22% of its revenues from europe and 16% from various emerging market countries. each of the company's segments generates sales from these marketplaces. while the company believes any downturn in the european or emerging marketplaces might be offset to some degree by the relative stability in north america, the company's future growth, profitability and financial liquidity could be affected, in several ways, including but not limited to the following:
•   depressed consumer and business confidence may decrease demand for products and services;
•   customers may implement cost-reduction initiatives or delay purchases to address inventory levels;
•   significant declines of foreign currency values in countries where the company operates could impact both the revenue growth and overall profitability in those geographies;
•   a slowing or contracting chinese economy could reduce china's consumption and negatively impact the company's sales in that region, as well as globally;
•   a devaluation of foreign currencies could have an effect on the credit worthiness (as well as the availability of funds) of customers in those regions impacting the collectability of receivables;
•   a devaluation of foreign currencies could have an adverse effect on the value of financial assets of the company in the effected countries;
•   the impact of an event (individual country default or break up of the euro) could have an adverse impact on the global credit markets and global liquidity potentially impacting the company's ability to access these credit markets and to raise capital.
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could negatively impact profitability.
the company manufactures and sells its products in many countries throughout the world. as a result, there is exposure to foreign currency risk as the company enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies. the company's predominant currency exposures are related to the euro, canadian dollar, british pound, australian dollar, brazilian real, argentine peso, chinese renminbi ("rmb") and the taiwan dollar. in preparing its financial statements, for foreign operations with functional currencies other than the u.s. dollar, asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates, and income and expenses are translated using weighted-average exchange rates. with respect to the effects on translated earnings, if the u.s. dollar strengthens relative to local currencies, the company's earnings could be negatively impacted. in 2015, translational and transactional foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted pre-tax earnings by approximately $220 million and diluted earnings per share by approximately $1.13. the translational and transactional impacts will vary over time and may be more material in the future. although the company utilizes risk management tools, including hedging, as it deems appropriate, to mitigate a portion of potential market fluctuations in foreign currencies, there can be no assurance that such measures will result in all market fluctuation exposure being eliminated. the company generally does not hedge the translation of its non-u.s. dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries, but may choose to do so in certain instances.
the company sources many products from china and other asian low-cost countries for resale in other regions. to the extent the rmb or other currencies appreciate, the company may experience cost increases on such purchases. the company may not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost increases and thus its profitability may be adversely impacted.
11
the company has incurred, and may incur in the future, significant indebtedness, or issue additional equity securities, in connection with mergers or acquisitions which may impact the manner in which it conducts business or the company's access to external sources of liquidity. the potential issuance of such securities may limit the company's ability to implement elements of its growth strategy and may have a dilutive effect on earnings.
as described in note h, long-term debt and financing arrangements, of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8, the company has an amended and restated five-year $1.75 billion committed credit facility. no amounts were outstanding against this facility at january 2, 2016.
the instruments and agreements governing certain of the company's current indebtedness contain requirements or restrictive covenants that include, among other things:
•   a limitation on creating liens on certain property of the company and its subsidiaries;
•   a restriction on entering into certain sale-leaseback transactions;
•   customary events of default. if an event of default occurs and is continuing, the company might be required to repay all amounts outstanding under the respective instrument or agreement; and
•   maintenance of a specified financial ratio. the company has an interest coverage covenant that must be maintained to permit continued access to its committed revolving credit facilities. the interest coverage ratio tested for covenant compliance compares adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to adjusted interest expense ("adjusted ebitda"/"adjusted interest expense"); such adjustments to interest or ebitda include, but are not limited to, removal of non-cash interest expense and stock-based compensation expense. the ratio required for compliance is 3.5 times ebitda to 1.0 times interest expense and is computed quarterly, on a rolling twelve months (last twelve months) basis. under this covenant definition, the interest coverage ratio was approximately 9 times ebitda or higher in each of the 2015 quarterly measurement periods. management does not believe it is reasonably likely the company will breach this covenant. failure to maintain this ratio could adversely affect further access to liquidity.
future instruments and agreements governing indebtedness may impose other restrictive conditions or covenants. such covenants could restrict the company in the manner in which it conducts business and operations as well as in the pursuit of its growth and repositioning strategies.
the company is exposed to counterparty risk in its hedging arrangements.
from time to time, the company enters into arrangements with financial institutions to hedge exposure to fluctuations in currency and interest rates, including forward contracts, options and swap agreements. the failure of one or more counterparties to the company's hedging arrangements to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect the company's results of operations.
tight capital and credit markets or the failure to maintain credit ratings could adversely affect the company by limiting the company's ability to borrow or otherwise access liquidity.
the company's long-term growth plans are dependent on, among other things, the availability of funding to support corporate initiatives and complete appropriate acquisitions and the ability to increase sales of existing product lines. while the company has not encountered financing difficulties to date, the capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption in recent years. market conditions could make it more difficult for the company to borrow or otherwise obtain the cash required for significant new corporate initiatives and acquisitions. in addition, there could be a number of follow-on effects from such a credit crisis on the company's businesses, including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays; inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company's products and services and/or customer insolvencies.
in addition, the major rating agencies regularly evaluate the company for purposes of assigning credit ratings. the company's ability to access the credit markets, and the cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of its credit ratings and current market conditions. failure to maintain credit ratings that are acceptable to investors may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which the company is able to obtain financing, as well as access to the capital markets.
12
the company's acquisitions, as well as general business reorganizations, may result in significant costs and certain risks for its business and operations.
the company has completed a number of acquisitions in recent years including, but not limited to, infastech, jiangsu guoqiang tools ("gq") and niscayah. the company may make additional acquisitions in the future.
acquisitions involve a number of risks, including:
•   the failure to identify the most suitable candidates for acquisitions;
•   the ability to identify and close on appropriate acquisition opportunities within desired timeframes at reasonable cost;
•   the anticipated additional revenues from the acquired companies do not materialize, despite extensive due diligence;
•   the possibility that the acquired companies will not be successfully integrated or that anticipated cost savings, synergies, or other benefits will not be realized;
•   the acquired businesses will lose market acceptance or profitability;
•   the diversion of company management's attention and other resources;
•   the incurrence of unexpected costs and liabilities, including those associated with undisclosed pre-closing regulatory violations by the acquired business; and
•   the loss of key personnel and clients or customers of acquired companies.
in addition, the success of the company's long-term growth and repositioning strategy will depend in part on successful general reorganization including its ability to:
•   combine businesses and operations;
•   integrate departments, systems and procedures; and
•   obtain cost savings and other efficiencies from such reorganizations, including the company's functional transformation initiative.
failure to effectively consummate or manage future acquisitions and general business reorganizations, and mitigate the related risks, may adversely affect the company's existing businesses and harm its operational results due to large write-offs, significant restructuring costs, contingent liabilities, substantial depreciation, adverse tax or other consequences. the company cannot ensure that such integrations and reorganizations will be successfully completed or that all of the planned synergies and other benefits will be realized.
expansion of the company's activity in emerging markets may result in risks due to differences in business practices and cultures.
the company's growth plans include efforts to increase revenue from emerging markets through both organic growth and acquisitions. local business practices in these regions may not comply with u.s. laws, local laws or other laws applicable to the company. when investigating potential acquisitions, the company seeks to identify historical practices of target companies that would create liability or other exposures for the company were they to continue post-completion or as a successor to the target. where such practices are discovered, the company assesses the risk to determine whether it is prepared to proceed with the transaction. in assessing the risk, the company looks at, among other factors, the nature of the violation, the potential liability, including any fines or penalties that might be incurred, the ability to avoid, minimize or obtain indemnity for the risks, and the likelihood that the company would be able to ensure that any such practices are discontinued following completion of the acquisition through implementation of its own policies and procedures. due diligence and risk assessment are, however, imperfect processes, and it is possible that the company will not discover problematic practices until after completion, or that the company will underestimate the risks associated with historical activities. should that occur, the company may incur fees, fines, penalties, injury to its reputation or other damage that could negatively impact the company's earnings.
significant judgment and certain estimates are required in determining the company's worldwide provision for income taxes. future tax law changes and audit results may materially increase the company's prospective income tax expense.
the company is subject to income taxation in the u.s. as well as numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining the company's worldwide income tax provision and accordingly there are many transactions and computations for which the final income tax determination is uncertain. the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still subject to
13
audit based on the most currently available information, which involves inherent uncertainty. the company is routinely audited by income tax authorities in many tax jurisdictions. although management believes the recorded tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcome of any audit (or related litigation) could differ materially from amounts reflected in the company's income tax accruals. additionally, it is possible that future income tax legislation may be enacted that could have a material impact on the company's worldwide income tax provision beginning with the period that such legislation becomes enacted. lastly, the global income tax provision can be materially impacted due to foreign currency fluctuations against the u.s. dollar since a significant amount of the company's earnings are generated outside the united states.
the company's failure to continue to successfully avoid, manage, defend, litigate and accrue for claims and litigation could negatively impact its results of operations or cash flows.
the company is exposed to and becomes involved in various litigation matters arising out of the ordinary routine conduct of its business, including, from time to time, actual or threatened litigation relating to such items as commercial transactions, product liability, workers compensation, the company's distributors and franchisees, intellectual property claims and regulatory actions.
in addition, the company is subject to environmental laws in each jurisdiction in which business is conducted. some of the company's products incorporate substances that are regulated in some jurisdictions in which it conducts manufacturing operations. the company could be subject to liability if it does not comply with these regulations. in addition, the company is currently, and may in the future be held responsible for remedial investigations and clean-up costs resulting from the discharge of hazardous substances into the environment, including sites that have never been owned or operated by the company but at which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws and regulations. changes in environmental and other laws and regulations in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect the company's operations due to increased costs of compliance and potential liability for non-compliance.
the company manufactures products, configures and installs security systems and performs various services that create exposure to product and professional liability claims and litigation. if such products, systems and services are not properly manufactured, configured, installed, designed or delivered, personal injuries, property damage or business interruption could result, which could subject the company to claims for damages. the costs associated with defending product liability claims and payment of damages could be substantial. the company's reputation could also be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful.
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to successfully avoid, manage and defend such matters. in addition, given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures, actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the company's estimates for such contingent liabilities.
the company's products could be recalled.
the consumer product safety commission or other applicable regulatory bodies may require the recall, repair or replacement of the company's products if those products are found not to be in compliance with applicable standards or regulations. a recall could increase costs and adversely impact the company's reputation.
the company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable.
the company's outstanding trade receivables are not generally covered by collateral or credit insurance. while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and non-trade receivables, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses, which could have an adverse effect on the company's financial condition and operating results.
if the company were required to write-down all or part of its goodwill, indefinite-lived trade names, or other definite-lived intangible assets, its net income and net worth could be materially adversely affected.
as a result of the black and decker merger and other acquisitions, the company has $7.084 billion of goodwill, $1.578 billion of indefinite-lived trade names and $0.964 billion of definite-lived intangible assets at january 2, 2016. the company is required to periodically, at least annually, determine if its goodwill or indefinite-lived trade names have become impaired, in which case it would write down the impaired portion of the intangible asset. the definite-lived intangible assets, including customer relationships, are amortized over their estimated useful lives; such assets are also evaluated for impairment when appropriate. impairment of intangible assets may be triggered by developments outside of the company's control, such as worsening economic conditions, technological change, intensified competition or other factors resulting in deleterious consequences.
if the investments in employee benefit plans do not perform as expected, the company may have to contribute additional amounts to these plans, which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses or other business purposes.
14
the company sponsors pension and other post-retirement defined benefit plans. the company's defined benefit plan assets are currently invested in equity securities, government and corporate bonds and other fixed income securities, money market instruments and insurance contracts. the company's funding policy is generally to contribute amounts determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and future benefits in accordance with applicable law which require, among other things, that the company make cash contributions to under-funded pension plans. during 2015, the company made cash contributions to its defined benefit plans of $66 million and it expects to contribute $52 million to its defined benefit plans in 2016.
there can be no assurance that the value of the defined benefit plan assets, or the investment returns on those plan assets, will be sufficient in the future. it is therefore possible that the company may be required to make higher cash contributions to the plans in future years which would reduce the cash available for other business purposes, and that the company will have to recognize a significant pension liability adjustment which would decrease the net assets of the company and result in higher expense in future years. the fair value of these assets at january 2, 2016 was $2.129 billion.
legal or technological hurdles associated with the expansion of use of rfid and rtls technologies in company products could adversely affect the company's growth initiatives and long term results.
the company's growth initiatives call for expansions of use of rfid and rtls technologies both geographically and through incorporation of these technologies into new products. in connection with these activities, the company may encounter both technological difficulties and legal impediments, including, but not limited to, design requirements, ownership claims and licensing or permitting requirements, that could delay or prevent the use of these technologies in certain products and/or in certain geographies. any such impediments could adversely impact the company's plans for growth and future results.
risks associated with hostilities involving north korea.
the company has a number of key suppliers in south korea. escalation of hostilities with north korea and/or military action in the region could cause disruptions in the company's supply chain which could, in turn, cause product shortages, delays in delivery and/or increases in the company's cost incurred to produce and deliver products to its customers.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the financial and business analysis below provides information which the company believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. this financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes. all references to "notes" in this item 7 refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report.
the following discussion and certain other sections of this annual report on form 10-k contain statements reflecting the company's views about its future performance that constitute "forward-looking statements" under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which the company operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. any statements contained herein (including without limitation statements to the effect that stanley black & decker, inc. or its management "believes", "expects", "anticipates", "plans" and similar expressions) that are not statements of historical fact should be considered forward-looking statements. these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. there are a number of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. these factors include, without limitation, those set forth, or incorporated by reference, below under the heading "cautionary statements". the company does not intend to update publicly any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
strategic objectives the company continues to employ the following strategic framework:
•   maintaining organic growth momentum by utilizing sfs 2.0 as a catalyst, diversifying toward higher growth, higher profit businesses, and increasing relative weighting of emerging markets;
•   being selective and operating in markets where brand is meaningful, the value proposition is definable and sustainable through innovation and global cost leadership is achievable;
•   pursuing acquisitive growth on multiple fronts through opportunistically consolidating the tool industry and expanding the industrial platform in engineered fastening and infrastructure.
the company is continuing to pursue a growth and acquisition strategy that involves industry, geographic and customer diversification to foster sustainable revenue, earnings and cash flow growth. the company is focused on growing organically, including increasing its presence in emerging markets, with a goal of generating greater than 20% of annual revenues from those markets, and leveraging the stanley fulfillment system, a now expanded program focused on breakthrough innovation and digital capabilities while accelerating commercial and supply chain excellence, and funding these required investments through functional transformation. these objectives have been significantly enhanced by the black & decker merger, which along with the impact from the company's diversification strategy has driven continued improvements in financial performance. sales outside the u.s. represented 47% of total net sales in 2015, up from 29% in 2002. as further illustration of this diversification strategy, sales to u.s. and international home centers and mass merchants accounted for approximately 27% of total sales in 2015 compared to 31% in 2010.
execution of the above strategy has resulted in approximately $6.2 billion of acquisitions since 2002 (aside from the black & decker merger), several divestitures (including the sale of hhi in december 2012), increased brand investment, improved efficiency in the supply chain and manufacturing operation, and enhanced investments in organic growth, enabled by cash flow generation and increased debt capacity. over the last decade, the company has returned approximately 50% of normalized free cash flow to its shareowners.
each of the company's franchises share common attributes: they have world-class brands and attractive growth characteristics, they are scalable and defensible, and they can differentiate through innovation.
•   the tools &amp; storage business is the tool company to own with its strong brands, proven innovation machine, global scale, and broad offering of power and hand tools across many channels in both developed and developing markets.
•   the engineered fastening business is a highly profitable, gdp+ growth business offering high value-added innovative solutions with recurring revenue attributes and global scale.
•   the convergent security solutions ("css") business, with its value-add vertical market offerings and attractive recurring revenue, presents a significant margin accretion opportunity over the longer term. the security business,
20
which has historically provided a stable revenue stream through economic cycles, is a gateway into the digital world and an avenue to capitalize on rapid digital changes.
as communicated at the may 2015 investor day, the company intends to provide further information on the state of its security franchise and its fit within the company's portfolio in the second half of 2016. the company is encouraged by security's recent favorable performance trends of improving operating margins, increasing order rates and stabilizing attrition at targeted levels. operational enhancements are beginning to take hold across the segment and talent upgrades in many portions of the business are starting to pay dividends in terms of results and building a high performance culture.
the company's three-year annual financial targets ("2018 vision") communicated in may 2015, which assumes a relatively stable currency environment and approximately $50 million of annual restructuring costs, include:
•   4-6% organic revenue growth, with total revenue growth enhanced by acquisitions;
•   50-75 basis points of operating margin rate improvement to approximately 16% by 2018;
•   10-12% earnings per share growth (including acquisitions), 7-9% organic growth;
•   cash flow return on investment ("cfroi") expansion to 14-15%; and
•   progress towards 10+ working capital turns.
in terms of capital allocation, the company remains committed to returning approximately 50% of free cash flow to shareholders through a strong and growing dividend as well as opportunistically repurchasing shares. the remaining free cash flow (approximately 50%) will be deployed towards acquisitions. since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2014, the company has reduced its share count by the equivalent of approximately $1.2 billion worth of shares by utilizing both cash and equity derivatives.
the following represents recent examples of executing on the company's strategic objectives:
acquisitions in may 2013, the company purchased a 60% controlling share in jiangsu guoqiang tools co., ltd. ("gq") for a total purchase price of $48.5 million, net of cash acquired. in december 2015, the company purchased the remaining 40% interest for a total purchase price of $33.5 million. gq is a manufacturer and seller of power tools in both domestic and foreign markets. the acquisition of gq complements the company's existing power tools product offerings and further diversifies the company's operations and international presence. this acquisition allows the company to accelerate its emerging market mid-price point product strategy. gq is headquartered in qidong, china and has been consolidated into the company's tools & storage segment.
in february 2013, the company acquired a 100% ownership interest in infastech for a total purchase price of $826.4 million, net of cash acquired. infastech designs, manufactures and distributes highly-engineered fastening technologies and applications for a diverse blue-chip customer base in the industrial, electronics, automotive, construction and aerospace end markets. the acquisition of infastech added to the company's strong positioning in specialty engineered fastening, an industry with solid growth prospects, and further expanded the company's global footprint with its strong concentration in fast-growing emerging markets. infastech is headquartered in hong kong and has been consolidated into the company's industrial segment.
hhi and tong lung residential divestiture in december 2012, the company sold hhi to spectrum for approximately $1.4 billion in cash. hhi is a provider of residential locksets, residential builders hardware and plumbing products marketed under the kwikset, weiser, baldwin, stanley, national and pfister brands. the majority of the hhi business was part of the company's security segment. the divestiture of the hhi business is part of the continued diversification of the company's revenue streams and geographic footprint consistent with the company's strategic framework.
the purchase and sale agreement stipulated that the sale occur in a first and second closing, for approximately $1.3 billion and approximately $94 million, respectively. the first closing, which excluded the residential portion of the tong lung business, occurred on december 17, 2012. the second closing, relating to the residential portion of the tong lung business, occurred on april 8, 2013.
during 2013, the company completed the 2012 income tax return filings which included the final calculations of the tax gain on hhi sale which took place in 2012. as a result of these tax return filings, the company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $19.1 million within discontinued operations related to finalization of the taxable gain on the hhi sale. changes
21
to the original tax gain were driven primarily by the determination of the final purchase price allocation and the finalization of the u.s. tax basis calculation, both of which were finalized during 2013.
the net proceeds from this divestiture were used to repurchase $850 million of the company's common stock and for debt reduction, to ensure the company's leverage ratios remain in its target range.
refer to note e, acquisitions, and note t, discontinued operations, for further discussion of the company's acquisitions and divestitures.
driving further profitable growth by fully leveraging existing businesses while diversifying the business portfolio through expansion in the company's specified growth platforms remains important, management recognizes that the branded tool and storage product offerings in the tools & storage segment are important foundations that continue to provide strong cash flow and growth prospects. management is committed to growing these businesses through innovative product development, brand support, continued investment in emerging markets and a sharp focus on global cost-competitiveness.
as discussed previously, in the first quarter of 2015, the company made the decision to combine the complementary elements of the cdiy and iar businesses into one tools & storage business. the combination of these two businesses is consistent with the company's strategy to continue to gain market share and consolidate the tool industry. the decision was based on the businesses' powerful family of brands, global scale and breadth of products across power and hand tools, storage and accessories, in addition to diverse channel access across the spectrum of construction, diy, industrial and automotive repair markets. the tools & storage business represents an important foundation of the company that will continue to provide strong cash flow and future growth.
continuing to invest in the stanley black & decker brands the company has a strong portfolio of brands associated with high-quality products including stanley®, black+decker®, dewalt®, porter-cable®, bostitch®, proto®, mac®, facom®, aeroscout®, powers®, lista®, sidchrome®, vidmar®, sonitrol®, and gq®. the stanley®, black+decker® and dewalt® brands are recognized as three of the world's great brands and are amongst the company's most valuable assets. sustained brand support has yielded a steady improvement across the spectrum of brand awareness measures, most notably in unaided stanley hand tool brand awareness. during 2015, the stanley® and dewalt® brands had prominent signage at nine major league baseball stadiums and 30% of all major league baseball games. the company has also maintained long-standing nascar and nhra racing sponsorships, which provided brand exposure during 42 events in 2015. the company has continued its ten-year alliance agreement with the walt disney world resort® whereby stanley® logos are displayed on construction walls throughout the theme parks and stanley®, mac®, proto®, and vidmar® brand logos and/or products are featured in various attractions where they are seen by approximately 45 million visitors each year. additionally, stanley is "the official tool provider of the walt disney world resort®." in 2009, the company also began advertising in the english premier league, which is the number one soccer league in the world, watched weekly by 650 million people. starting in 2014, the company became a sponsor of the world's most popular football club, fc barcelona, including player image rights, hospitality assets and stadium signage. the company advertises in televised professional bull riders events, one of the fastest growing sports with over 44 million fans, as well as the the built ford tough series, which is broadcast in 129 territories and to more than 400 million households globally. additionally, the company sponsors moto gp, the world's premiere motorcycle racing series reaching 130 million fans per race and airing in over 200 countries, and the monster yamaha tech3 team. the company has entered a partnership with the chinese basketball association (cba), the most popular sport in china with over 800 million fans. the company will continue to allocate its brand and advertising spend wisely and it currently generates more than 200 billion brand impressions annually.

the stanley fulfillment system (sfs)
sfs employs continuous improvement techniques to streamline operations (front end & back office) and drive efficiency throughout the supply chain. sfs has five core principles that work in concert: sales and operations planning ("s&op"), operational lean, complexity reduction, global supply management, and order-to-cash excellence. s&op is a dynamic and continuous unified process that links and balances supply and demand in a manner that produces world-class fill rates while minimizing dsi (days sales of inventory). operational lean is the systemic application of lean principles in progressive steps throughout the enterprise to optimize flow toward a pre-defined end state by eliminating waste, increasing efficiency and driving value. complexity reduction is a focused and overt effort to eradicate costly and unnecessary complexity from the company's products, supply chain and back room process and organizations. complexity reduction enables all other sfs elements and, when successfully deployed, results in world-class cost, speed of execution and customer satisfaction. global supply management focuses on strategically leveraging the company's scale to achieve the best possible price and payment terms with the best possible quality, service and delivery among all categories of spend. order-to-cash excellence is a methodical, process-based approach that provides a user-friendly, automated and error-proof customer experience from intent-to-purchase to shipping and billing to payment, while minimizing cash collection cycle time and dso (days sales outstanding). other benefits of sfs include reductions in lead times, rapid realization of synergies during acquisition integrations, and focus on employee safety. the core sfs principles helped to mitigate the substantial impact of material and energy price inflation that was experienced in recent years.
sfs is also instrumental in the reduction of working capital as evidenced by the 56% improvement in working capital turns for the company from 5.9 (excluding hhi) at the end of 2010, after the merger with black & decker, to 9.2 at the end of 2015. the continued efforts to deploy sfs across the entire company and increase turns have created significant opportunities to generate incremental free cash flow. going forward, the company plans to further leverage sfs to generate ongoing improvements both in the existing business and future acquisitions in working capital turns, cycle times, complexity reduction and customer service levels, with a goal of ultimately achieving 10 working capital turns.
in addition, the company has embarked on an initiative to drive from a more programmatic growth mentality to a true organic growth culture by more deeply embedding breakthrough innovation and commercial excellence into its businesses, and at the same time, becoming a significantly more digitally-enabled enterprise. a new breed of digital technologies is changing the competitive landscape at unprecedented rates, creating both threats and opportunities, and it is clear that organizations that stand still will be left behind.
to that end, the company has spent considerable time and effort developing the next iteration of the successful sfs program, which has driven working capital turns to world-class levels and vastly improved the supply chain and customer-facing metrics. entitled "sfs 2.0" this refreshed and revitalized business system will continue the progress on core sfs, but importantly, provide resources and added focus into functional transformation, digital excellence, commercial excellence and breakthrough innovation. sfs 2.0 was launched in 2015 and immediately created a positive impact on 2015 results by driving organic growth, improving margins and reaching new levels of innovation and digitization across the entire organization. the company is making a significant commitment to sfs 2.0 and management believes that its success will be characterized by more consistent organic growth in the 4-6% range as well as expanded operating margin rates over the next 3 to 5 years as the company leverages the growth and reduces structural sg&a levels.
the expanded sfs 2.0 will transform the company by focusing its employees on the following five key pillars:
•   core sfs, which targets asset efficiency, remains as the foundation for the company's operating system and despite the significant advances made in improving working capital turns and free cash generation, opportunities still remain for further working capital improvements and supply chain efficiency to enhance the company's already strong asset efficiency performance.
•   functional transformation takes a clean-sheet approach to redesigning the company's key support functions such as finance, hr, it and others, which although highly effective, after 80 or so acquisitions are not as efficient as they can be, based on external benchmarks. this presents the company with an opportunity to reduce its sg&amp;a as a percent of sales and becomes a cost effectiveness enabler with the side benefit of providing the funding mechanism for the following other aspects of sfs 2.0, which together act as enablers for outsized organic growth and margin expansion.
•   digital excellence uses the power of digital to be disruptive and more effective and far reaching through the company's products, solutions and analytics. digital excellence means leveraging the power of emerging technologies across the company's businesses to connected devices, the internet of things, and big data, as well as social and mobile, even more than what is being done today. digital will touch all aspects of the organization and feeds into and supports the other elements of sfs 2.0 - enabling better asset efficiency through core sfs, greater cost
23
effectiveness via the company's support functions, and improving revenues and margins via customer-facing opportunities.
•   commercial excellence is about how the company becomes more effective and efficient in its customer-facing processes resulting in continued share gains and margin expansion throughout its businesses. the company views commercial excellence as world-class execution across seven areas: customer insights, innovation and portfolio management, pricing and promotion, brand and marketing, sales force deployment and effectiveness, channel programs, and the customer experience.
•   breakthrough innovation is aimed at developing a breakthrough innovation culture to identify market disruptive technologies. although the company has a track record of being highly innovative, opportunities exist to be even more innovative. the company's breakthrough innovation focus is on coming up with the next major breakthrough in the industries in which the company operates which, when combined with its existing strong core innovation machine, will drive outsized share gains and margin expansion.
these five pillars will serve as a powerful value driver in the years ahead, feeding the company's new product innovation machine, embracing outstanding commercial and supply chain excellence, embedding digital into the various business models, and funding it all with world-class functional efficiency. taken together, these pillars will directly support achievement of the company's long-term financial objectives and further enable its shareholder-friendly capital allocation approach, which has served the company well in the past and will continue to do so in the future.
certain items impacting earnings merger and acquisition-related and other charges impacting 2013 earnings throughout md&a, the company has provided a discussion of its 2013 results both inclusive and exclusive of merger and acquisition-related and other charges. merger and acquisition-related charges in 2013 related primarily to the black & decker merger and niscayah and infastech acquisitions, while other charges related to the extinguishment of debt. the amounts and measures, including gross profit and segment profit, on a basis excluding such charges are considered relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the company's 2013 results aside from the material impact of these charges. in addition, these measures are utilized internally by management to understand business trends, as once the anticipated cost synergies from the black & decker merger and other acquisitions were realized, such charges are not expected to recur. merger and acquisition-related charges were not significant in 2015 or 2014 and therefore, are not discussed separately in md&a for those years.
during 2013, the company reported $390 million in pre-tax merger and acquisition-related and other charges, which were comprised of the following:
•   $29 million reducing gross profit primarily pertaining to integration-related matters and amortization of the inventory step-up adjustment for the infastech acquisition;
•   $136 million in selling, general &amp; administrative expenses primarily for integration-related administrative costs and consulting fees, as well as employee related matters;
•   $30 million in other-net primarily related to deal transaction costs;
•   $21 million pre-tax loss on the extinguishment of $300 million of debt in the fourth quarter of 2013; and
•   $174 million in net restructuring charges, which primarily represent niscayah integration-related restructuring charges and cost reduction actions associated with the severance of employees.
the tax effect on the above charges, some of which were not tax deductible, in 2013 was $120 million, resulting in an after-tax charge of $270 million, or $1.70 per diluted share.
outlook for 2016
this outlook discussion is intended to provide broad insight into the company's near-term earnings and cash flow generation prospects. the company expects diluted earnings per share to approximate $6.00 to $6.20 in 2016, with free cash flow conversion, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, approximating 100%. the 2016 outlook assumes organic sales growth of 3% resulting in approximately $0.45 to $0.50 of diluted earnings per share accretion. commodity deflation, cost actions and productivity initiatives are expected to yield approximately $0.45 to $0.50 of diluted earnings per share accretion. the company anticipates approximately $0.13 of diluted eps accretion resulting from lower average share count, including approximately $300 million of share repurchases in 2016. foreign exchange headwinds are expected to continue to negatively impact earnings by approximately $170 to $190 million, or $0.85 to $0.95 of diluted earnings per share. restructuring charges and the tax rate are expected to be relatively consistent with 2015 levels.

results of operations below is a summary of the company's operating results at the consolidated level, followed by an overview of business segment performance.
terminology: the term "organic" is utilized to describe results aside from the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations and acquisitions during their initial 12 months of ownership. this ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods.
net sales: net sales were $11.172 billion in 2015, down 1% compared to $11.339 billion in 2014. organic sales volume and pricing provided increases of 5% and 1%, respectively, but were more than offset by a 7% decrease due to negative impacts from foreign currency. in the tools & storage segment, organic sales increased 8% compared to 2014 as a result of strong growth across all regions primarily due to share gains from innovative new products and an expanded retail footprint. net sales in the security segment decreased 7% compared to 2014 primarily due to foreign currency declines of 7% and lower volumes in north america and emerging markets, which more than offset organic growth in europe. in the industrial segment, organic sales grew 2% relative to 2014 due to strong organic growth in the engineered fastening business primarily as a result of strong global automotive revenues.
net sales were $11.339 billion in 2014, up 4% compared to $10.890 billion in 2013. organic sales and acquisitions (primarily infastech) provided increases of 5% and 1% in net sales, respectively, while unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation resulted in a decrease of 2% in net sales. in the tools & storage segment, organic sales increased 6% compared to 2013 as a result of higher volumes in north america and europe primarily due to successful new product introductions and an expanded retail footprint, as well as significant market share gains driven by organic growth initiatives. in the industrial segment, organic sales grew 5% relative to 2013 due to strong organic growth in the engineered fastening business. in the security segment, net sales decreased 2% compared to 2013 due to lower sales volumes in europe and unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation, which more than offset modest increases in price.
gross profit: the company reported gross profit of $4.072 billion, or 36.4% of net sales, in 2015 compared to $4.103 billion, or 36.2% of net sales, in 2014. the increase in the profit rate reflects favorable impacts from volume leverage, price, productivity, cost actions and commodity deflation, which more than offset significant unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations.
the company reported gross profit of $4.103 billion, or 36.2% of net sales, in 2014 compared to $3.904 billion, or 35.8% of net sales, in 2013. merger and acquisition-related charges, which reduced gross profit, were $29.5 million in 2013. excluding these charges, gross profit was 36.1% of net sales in 2013. the increase in the 2014 profit rate reflects favorable impacts from sales volume, price, supply chain productivity and cost management, which more than offset negative impacts from foreign currency fluctuations and lower security margins caused by field operations inefficiencies and negative installation and recurring revenue mix.
sg&a expense: selling, general and administrative expenses, inclusive of the provision for doubtful accounts ("sg&a"), were $2.486 billion, or 22.3% of net sales, in 2015 compared to $2.596 billion, or 22.9% of net sales, in 2014. the decrease in the sg&a rate reflects the positive impacts of volume leverage and cost controls.
sg&a expenses were $2.596 billion, or 22.9% of net sales, in 2014 compared to $2.691 billion, or 24.7% of net sales in 2013. within sg&a, merger and acquisition-related compensation costs and integration-related expenses totaled $135.7 million in 2013. excluding these charges, sg&a was 23.5% of net sales in 2013. the decrease in the sg&a rate was mainly attributable to increased volumes and the positive impacts from headcount reduction actions and the company's efforts to significantly reduce indirect expenses.
distribution center costs (i.e. warehousing and fulfillment facility and associated labor costs) are classified within sg&a. this classification may differ from other companies who may report such expenses within cost of sales. due to diversity in practice, to the extent the classification of these distribution costs differs from other companies, the company's gross margins may not be comparable. such distribution costs classified in sg&a amounted to $229.3 million in 2015, $243.2 million in 2014 and $229.5 million in 2013.
corporate overhead: the corporate overhead element of sg&a and gross profit, which is not allocated to the business segments, amounted to $164.0 million in 2015, $177.4 million in 2014 and $254.0 million in 2013. the decrease in 2015 compared to 2014 reflects the positive impacts from the company's effort to reduce certain indirect expenses. corporate overhead in 2013 included $89.4 million of merger and acquisition-related charges. corporate overhead, excluding the 2013 merger and acquisition-related charges, represented 1.5%, 1.6%, and 1.5% of net sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
25
other-net: other-net totaled $222.0 million of expense in 2015 compared to $239.7 million of expense in 2014. the decrease was primarily driven by lower amortization expense partially offset by negative impacts of foreign currency.
other-net amounted to $239.7 million of expense in 2014 compared to $283.9 million of expense in 2013. the decrease was primarily driven by lower amortization expense and acquisition-related costs in 2014 as compared to 2013.
gain/loss on debt extinguishment: during the fourth quarter of 2014, the company extinguished $45.7 million of its notes payable and recognized a net pre-tax gain of $0.1 million on extinguishment. during the fourth quarter of 2013, the company extinguished $300 million of its notes payable and recognized a $20.6 million pre-tax loss on extinguishment.
interest, net: net interest expense in 2015 was $165.2 million compared to $163.6 million in 2014 and $147.3 million in 2013. the increase in net interest expense in 2015 versus 2014 was primarily attributable to the termination of interest rate swaps in 2014 hedging the company's $400 million 5.20% notes due 2040. the increase in net interest expense in 2014 versus 2013 mainly relates to interest costs associated with the issuance of debt in the fourth quarter of 2013, partially offset by higher interest income.
income taxes: the company's effective tax rate was 21.6% in 2015, 20.9% in 2014, and 11.7% in 2013. the effective tax rate in 2015 differed from the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to a portion of the company's earnings being realized in lower-taxed foreign jurisdictions, adjustments to tax positions relating to undistributed foreign earnings, and reversals of valuation allowances for certain foreign and u.s. state net operating losses, which have become realizable. the effective tax rate in 2014 differed from the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to a portion of the company's earnings being realized in lower-taxed foreign jurisdictions, the passage of u.s. tax legislation, settlement of various income tax audits and the reversal of valuation allowances for certain foreign net operating losses which have become realizable. the effective tax rate in 2013 differed from the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to a portion of the company's earnings being realized in lower-taxed foreign jurisdictions, the acceleration of certain tax credits, the recurring benefit of various foreign business integration structures and the reversal of certain foreign and u.s. state uncertain tax position reserves, related largely to statute expiration.
business segment results the company's reportable segments are aggregations of businesses that have similar products, services and end markets, among other factors. the company utilizes segment profit (which is defined as net sales minus cost of sales and sg&a aside from corporate overhead expense), and segment profit as a percentage of net sales to assess the profitability of each segment. segment profit excludes the corporate overhead expense element of sg&a, other-net (inclusive of intangible asset amortization expense), restructuring charges, interest income, interest expense, and income tax expense. corporate overhead is comprised of world headquarters facility expense, cost for the executive management team and the expense pertaining to certain centralized functions that benefit the entire company but are not directly attributable to the businesses, such as legal and corporate finance functions. refer to note o, restructuring charges and asset impairments, and note f, goodwill and intangible assets, for the amount of net restructuring charges and intangibles amortization expense, respectively, attributable to each segment.
as previously discussed, in the first quarter of 2015, the company combined the construction & do-it-yourself ("cdiy") business with certain complementary elements of the industrial and automotive repair ("iar") and healthcare businesses (formerly part of the industrial and security segments, respectively) to form one tools & storage business. the company recast segment net sales and profit for 2014 and 2013 to align with this change in organizational structure. there was no impact to the consolidated financial statements of the company as a result of this change.
the company classifies its business into three reportable segments, which also represent its operating segments: tools & storage, security and industrial.
tools & storage:
the tools & storage segment is comprised of the power tools and hand tools & storage businesses. the power tools business includes professional products, consumer products and power tool accessories. professional products include professional grade corded and cordless electric power tools and equipment including drills, impact wrenches and drivers, grinders, saws, routers and sanders, as well as pneumatic tools and fasteners including nail guns, nails, staplers, and staples, concrete and masonry anchors. consumer products include corded and cordless electric power tools sold primarily under the black+decker brand, lawn and garden products including hedge trimmers, string trimmers, lawn mowers, edgers, and related accessories and home products such as hand held vacuums, paint tools and cleaning appliances. power tool accessories include drill bits, router bits, abrasives and saw blades. the hand tools & storage business sells measuring, leveling and
26
layout tools, planes, hammers, demolition tools, knives, saws, chisels and industrial and automotive tools. storage products include tool boxes, sawhorses, medical cabinets and engineered storage solution products.

tools & storage net sales increased $107.7 million, or 2%, in 2015 compared to 2014. organic sales increased 8% primarily due to organic growth of 11% in north america, 7% in europe, and 3% in emerging markets, while unfavorable effects of foreign currency decreased net sales by 6%. share gains from innovative new products and brand extensions combined with a healthy underlying u.s. tool market fueled growth in north america despite downward pressure in the industrial channels and canada. europe achieved above-market organic growth due to share gains from new products, an expanded retail footprint and solid commercial momentum. organic growth within the emerging markets was driven by favorable impacts of pricing and successful mid-price-point product releases, which more than offset weakness in certain markets, particularly russia and china.
segment profit amounted to $1,170.1 million, or 16.4% of net sales, in 2015 compared to $1,074.4 million, or 15.3% of net sales, in 2014. the increase in segment profit year-over-year was primarily driven by volume leverage, price, productivity, cost management and lower commodity prices, which more than offset significant foreign currency headwinds.
tools & storage net sales increased $328.0 million, or 5%, in 2014 compared with 2013. organic sales and acquisitions provided increases of 6% and 1%, respectively, while unfavorable effects of foreign currency decreased net sales by 2%. north america achieved 8% organic growth driven primarily by new product introductions and expanded retail offerings and partnerships on top of a healthy underlying tool market. organic sales in europe increased 7% year-over-year due to successful new product introductions and an expanding retail footprint, which helped generate market share gains in spite of continued challenging economic conditions. emerging markets grew 4% organically in 2014 bolstered by new product launches in the mid-price point segment despite persistently volatile economic conditions across all emerging markets.

(a)   future payments on long-term debt encompass all payments related to aggregate debt maturities, excluding certain fair value adjustments included in long-term debt, as discussed further in note h, long-term debt and financing arrangements.
(b)   future interest payments on long-term debt reflect the applicable fixed interest rate or variable rate for floating rate debt in effect at january 2, 2016.
(c)   inventory purchase commitments primarily consist of open purchase orders to purchase raw materials, components, and sourced products.
(d)   future cash flows on derivative instruments reflect the fair value and accrued interest as of january 2, 2016. the ultimate cash flows on these instruments will differ, perhaps significantly, based on applicable market interest and foreign currency rates at their maturity.
(e)   in october 2014 and march 2015, the company entered into forward share purchase contracts which obligate the company to pay $150.0 million and $350.0 million, respectively, plus additional amounts related to the forward component of the contracts to the respective financial institution counterparties not later than october 2016 or march 2017, respectively, or earlier at the company's option. see note j. capital stock for further discussion.
32
(f)   this amount principally represents contributions either required by regulations or laws or, with respect to unfunded plans, necessary to fund current benefits. the company has not presented estimated pension and post-retirement funding beyond 2016 as funding can vary significantly from year to year based upon changes in the fair value of the plan assets, actuarial assumptions, and curtailment/settlement actions.
(g)   these amounts represent future contract adjustment payments to holders of the company's equity purchase contracts. see note h, long-term debt and financing arrangements for further discussion.
to the extent the company can reliably determine when payments will occur pertaining to unrecognized tax liabilities, the related amount will be included in the table above. however, due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the $343.9 million of such liabilities at january 2, 2016, the company is unable to make a reliable estimate of when (if at all) amounts may be paid to the respective taxing authorities.
aside from debt payments, for which there is no tax benefit associated with repayment of principal, tax obligations and the equity purchase contract fees, payment of the above contractual obligations will typically generate a cash tax benefit such that the net cash outflow will be lower than the gross amounts summarized above.

market risk market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments, currencies, commodities and other items traded in global markets. the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, stock prices, bond prices and commodity prices, amongst others.
exposure to foreign currency risk results because the company, through its global businesses, enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies. the company's predominant currency exposures are related to the euro, canadian dollar, british pound, australian dollar, brazilian real, argentine peso, the chinese renminbi ("rmb") and the taiwan dollar. certain cross-currency trade flows arising from sales and procurement activities, as well as affiliate cross-border activity, are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk protection through the use of various derivative financial instruments which may include: purchased basket options, purchased options, collars, cross currency swaps and currency forwards. the company is thus able to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures and portfolio efficiencies to reduce the cost of purchasing derivative protection. at times, the company also enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases options to reduce the earnings and cash flow impact of non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables, primarily for affiliate transactions. gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures (the assets and liabilities being hedged). management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities, and in certain cases, may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain un-hedged. the company may also enter into cross-currency swaps and forward contracts to hedge the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service requirements. management estimates the foreign currency impact from its derivative financial instruments outstanding at the end of 2015 would have been approximately $27 million pre-tax loss based on a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in all net derivative currency positions; this effect would occur from the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. the company follows risk management policies in executing derivative financial instrument transactions, and does not use such instruments for speculative purposes. the company generally does not hedge the translation of its non-u.s. dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries, but may choose to do so in certain instances.
as mentioned above, the company routinely has cross-border trade and affiliate flows that cause an impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements. the company is also exposed to currency fluctuation volatility from the translation of foreign earnings into u.s. dollars and the economic impact of foreign currency volatility on monetary assets held in foreign currencies. it is more difficult to quantify the transactional effects from currency fluctuations than the translational effects. aside from the use of derivative instruments, which may be used to mitigate some of the exposure, transactional effects can potentially be influenced by actions the company may take. for example, if an exposure occurs from a european entity sourcing product from a u.s. supplier it may be possible to change to a european supplier. management estimates the
33
combined translational and transactional impact, on pre-tax earnings, of a 10% overall movement in exchange rates is approximately $132 million, or approximately $0.68 per diluted share. in 2015, translational and transactional foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted pre-tax earnings by approximately $220 million and diluted earnings per share by approximately $1.13.
the company's exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt and derivative obligations, short-term investments, and derivative financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio. the debt portfolio including both trade and affiliate debt, is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps, and cross-currency swaps.
the company's primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its floating rate debt and derivatives in the u.s. and is fairly represented by changes in libor rates. at january 2, 2016, the impact of a hypothetical 10% increase in the interest rates associated with the company's floating rate derivative and debt instruments would have an immaterial effect on the company's financial position and results of operations.
the company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses, particularly brass, nickel, resin, aluminum, copper, zinc, steel, and energy used in the production of finished goods. generally, commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative financial instruments, but instead are actively managed through customer product and service pricing actions, procurement-driven cost reduction initiatives and other productivity improvement projects.
fluctuations in the fair value of the company's common stock affect domestic retirement plan expense as discussed below in the employee stock ownership plan section of md&a. additionally, the company has $59 million of liabilities as of january 2, 2016 pertaining to unfunded defined contribution plans for certain u.s. employees for which there is mark-to-market exposure.
the assets held by the company's defined benefit plans are exposed to fluctuations in the market value of securities, primarily global stocks and fixed-income securities. the funding obligations for these plans would increase in the event of adverse changes in the plan asset values, although such funding would occur over a period of many years. in 2015, 2014 and 2013, there was an $11.0 million decrease and $285 million and $102 million increase, respectively, in investment returns on pension plan assets. the company expects funding obligations on its defined benefit plans to be approximately $52 million in 2016. the company employs diversified asset allocations to help mitigate this risk. management has worked to minimize this exposure by freezing and terminating defined benefit plans where appropriate.
the company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around the world. there are no instruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements due to a change in credit rating.
the company's existing credit facilities and sources of liquidity, including operating cash flows, are considered more than adequate to conduct business as normal. accordingly, based on present conditions and past history, management believes it is unlikely that operations will be materially affected by any potential deterioration of the general credit markets that may occur. the company believes that its strong financial position, operating cash flows, committed long-term credit facilities and borrowing capacity, and ready access to equity markets provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual dividend payments, to invest in the routine needs of its businesses, to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy and maintain its strong investment grade credit ratings.
other matters employee stock ownership plan as detailed in note l, employee benefit plans, the company has an esop under which the ongoing u.s. core and 401(k) defined contribution plans are funded. overall esop expense is affected by the market value of the company's stock on the monthly dates when shares are released, among other factors. the company's net esop activity resulted in expense of $0.8 million in 2015, $0.7 million in 2014, and $1.9 million in 2013. esop expense could increase in the future if the market value of the company's common stock declines.
critical accounting estimates - preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are described in note a, significant accounting policies. management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty. the most significant areas involving management estimates are described below. actual results in these areas could differ from management's estimates.
34
allowance for doubtful accounts - the company's estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods. the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved. first, a specific reserve is established for individual accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations. in these cases, management uses its judgment, based on the surrounding facts and circumstances, to record a specific reserve for those customers against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected. these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received. second, a reserve is determined for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to receivable aging categories. these percentages are based on historical collection and write-off experience.
if circumstances change, for example, due to the occurrence of higher-than-expected defaults or a significant adverse change in a major customer's ability to meet its financial obligation to the company, estimates of the recoverability of receivable amounts due could be reduced.
inventories - lower of cost or market, slow moving and obsolete - inventories in the u.s. are predominantly valued at the lower of last-in first-out ("lifo") cost or market, while non-u.s. inventories are valued at the lower of first-in, first-out ("fifo") cost or market. the calculation of lifo reserves, and therefore the net inventory valuation, is affected by inflation and deflation in inventory components. the company ensures all inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, and continually reviews the carrying value of discontinued product lines and stock-keeping-units ("skus") to determine that these items are properly valued. the company also continually evaluates the composition of its inventory and identifies obsolete and/or slow-moving inventories. inventory items identified as obsolete and/or slow-moving are evaluated to determine if write-downs are required. the company assesses the ability to dispose of these inventories at a price greater than cost. if it is determined that cost is less than market value, cost is used for inventory valuation. if market value is less than cost, the company writes down the related inventory to that value. if a write-down to the current market value is necessary, the market value cannot be greater than the net realizable value, or ceiling (defined as selling price less costs to sell and dispose), and cannot be lower than the net realizable value less a normal profit margin, also called the floor. if the company is not able to achieve its expectations regarding net realizable value of inventory at its current value, further write-downs would be recorded.
goodwill and intangible assets - the company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets. the determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions. in accordance with asc 350-20, "goodwill," acquired goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing at least annually or when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more-likely-than-not an impairment exists. definite-lived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more-likely-than-not that an impairment exists. goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses. the company reported $7.084 billion of goodwill, $1.578 billion of indefinite-lived trade names and $0.964 billion of definite-lived intangibles at january 2, 2016.
management tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. a reporting unit is an operating segment as defined in asc 280, "segment reporting," or one level below an operating segment (component level) as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of an operating segment having similar economic characteristics. if the carrying value of a reporting unit (including the value of goodwill) is greater than its fair value, an impairment may exist. an impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the recorded value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value.
during the third quarter of 2015, as required by the company's policy, goodwill and indefinite-lived trade names were tested for impairment. the company assessed the fair value of its reporting units based on a discounted cash flow valuation model. the key assumptions applied to the cash flow projections were discount rates, which ranged from 8% to 10.5%, near-term revenue growth rates over the next five years, which ranged from 2% to 10%, and perpetual growth rates ranging from 3% to 3.5%. these assumptions contemplated business, market and overall economic conditions. based on the results of this testing, the company determined that the fair values of each of its reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts. furthermore, management performed sensitivity analyses on the fair values resulting from the discounted cash flow valuation models utilizing more conservative assumptions that reflect reasonably likely future changes in the discount rates and perpetual growth rates in each of the reporting units. the discount rates were increased by 100 basis points with no impairment indicated. the perpetual growth rates were decreased by 150 basis points with no impairment indicated.
the fair values of indefinite-lived trade names were also assessed using a discounted cash flow valuation model. the key assumptions used included discount rates, royalty rates, and perpetual growth rates applied to the projected sales. based on these quantitative impairment tests, the company determined that the fair values of the indefinite-lived trade names exceeded their respective carrying amounts.
35
during the fourth quarter of 2015, in connection with its quarterly forecasting cycle, the company updated the forecasted operating results for each of its businesses based on the most recent financial results and best estimates of future operations. the updated forecasts reflected an expected decline in near-term revenue growth and profitability for the infrastructure reporting unit within the industrial segment, primarily due to ongoing difficult market conditions in the oil & gas industry, particularly in certain markets such as china and russia, as well as continued declines in scrap steel prices. accordingly, in connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended january 2, 2016, the company performed an updated impairment analysis with respect to the infrastructure reporting unit, which included approximately $273 million of goodwill at year-end. based on this analysis, which included revised assumptions of near-term revenue growth and profitability levels, it was determined that the fair value of the infrastructure reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 13%. therefore, management concluded it was not more-likely-than-not that an impairment had occurred. management is confident in the long-term viability and success of the infrastructure reporting unit based on the strong long-term growth prospects of the markets and geographies served, the intensified focus and investments being made in organic growth initiatives (bolstered by the recently implemented sfs 2.0 program), and infrastructure's leading market position in its respective industries.
in the event that future operating results of any of the company's reporting units do not meet current expectations, management, based upon conditions at the time, would consider taking restructuring or other actions as necessary to maximize revenue growth and profitability. accordingly, the above sensitivity analyses, while useful, should not be used as a sole predictor of potential impairment. a thorough analysis of all the facts and circumstances existing at that time would need to be performed to determine if recording an impairment loss would be appropriate.
defined benefit obligations - the valuation of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions. these assumptions, which are updated annually, include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future salary increase rates, and health care cost trend rates. the company considers current market conditions, including interest rates, to establish these assumptions. discount rates are developed considering the yields available on high-quality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the duration of the related benefit obligations. the company's weighted-average discount rates for the united states and international pension plans were 4.25% and 3.25%, respectively, at january 2, 2016. the company's weighted-average discount rate for the united states and international pension plans was 3.75% and 3.25%, respectively at january 3, 2015. as discussed further in note l, employee benefit plans, the company develops the expected return on plan assets considering various factors, which include its targeted asset allocation percentages, historic returns, and expected future returns. the company's expected rate of return assumptions for the united states and international pension plans were 6.50% and 5.25%, respectively, at january 2, 2016. the company will use a 5.60% weighted-average expected rate of return assumption to determine the 2016 net periodic benefit cost. a 25 basis point reduction in the expected rate of return assumption would increase 2016 net periodic benefit cost by approximately $5 million on a pre-tax basis.
the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate; however, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the company's financial position or results of operations. to the extent that actual (newly measured) results differ from the actuarial assumptions, the difference is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, and, if in excess of a specified corridor, amortized over future periods. the expected return on plan assets is determined using the expected rate of return and the fair value of plan assets. accordingly, market fluctuations in the fair value of plan assets can affect the net periodic benefit cost in the following year. the projected benefit obligation for defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $692 million at january 2, 2016. a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately $85 million at january 2, 2016. the primary black & decker u.s pension and post employment benefit plans were curtailed in late 2010, as well as the only material black & decker international plan, and in their place the company implemented defined contribution benefit plans. the vast majority of the projected benefit obligation pertains to plans that have been frozen; the remaining defined benefit plans that are not frozen are predominantly small domestic union plans and those that are statutorily mandated in certain international jurisdictions. the company recognized $11 million of defined benefit plan expense in 2015, which may fluctuate in future years depending upon various factors including future discount rates and actual returns on plan assets.
environmental - the company incurs costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of previously contaminated sites. future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the company's expenditures related to environmental matters.
the company's policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. the amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. the liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties. as assessments and remediation
36
progress at individual sites, the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available.
as of january 2, 2016, the company had reserves of $170.7 million for remediation activities associated with company-owned properties as well as for superfund sites, for losses that are probable and estimable. the range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is $130.4 million to $260.8 million which is subject to change in the near term. the company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns. liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with this policy.
income taxes - income taxes are accounted for in accordance with asc 740, "accounting for income taxes," which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized, using enacted tax rates, for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets, including net operating losses and capital losses, are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is "more likely than not" that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the company considers all positive and negative evidence including: estimates of future taxable income, considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies, the realizability of tax loss carryforwards and the future reversal of existing temporary differences. valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future, the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made. by contrast, if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts, it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable adjustment to earnings in the period in which that determination is made.
the company is subject to income tax in a number of locations, including many state and foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required when calculating its worldwide provision for income taxes. the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to certain of the company's unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months. these changes may be the result of settlement of ongoing audits or final decisions in transfer pricing matters. the company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still subject to audit based on the most current available information, which involves inherent uncertainty. for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority under the premise that the taxing authority has full knowledge of all relevant information. for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. the company recognizes interest and penalties associated with income taxes as a component of income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations. see note q, income taxes for further discussion.
risk insurance - to manage its insurance costs efficiently, the company self insures for certain u.s. business exposures and generally has low deductible plans internationally. for domestic workers' compensation, automobile and product liability (liability for alleged injuries associated with the company's products), the company generally purchases insurance coverage only for severe losses that are unlikely, and these lines of insurance involve the most significant accounting estimates. while different self insured retentions, in the form of deductibles and self insurance through its captive insurance company, exist for each of these lines of insurance, the maximum self insured retention is set at no more than $5 million per occurrence. the process of establishing risk insurance reserves includes consideration of actuarial valuations that reflect the company's specific loss history, actual claims reported, and industry trends among statistical and other factors to estimate the range of reserves required. risk insurance reserves are comprised of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts expected for development of these claims, as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims discounted to present value. the cash outflows related to risk insurance claims are expected to occur over a period of approximately 13 years. the company believes the liabilities recorded for these u.s. risk insurance reserves, totaling $96 million and $102 million as of january 2, 2016, and january 3, 2015, respectively, are adequate. due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process, it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate.
warranty - the company provides product and service warranties which vary across its businesses. the types of warranties offered generally range from one year to limited lifetime, while certain products carry no warranty. further, the company sometimes incurs discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product performance issues. historical warranty and service claim experience forms the basis for warranty obligations recognized. adjustments are recorded to the warranty liability as new information becomes available. the company believes the $105 million reserve for expected warranty claims as of january 2, 2016 is adequate, but due to judgments inherent in the reserve estimation process, including forecasting
37
future product reliability levels and costs of repair as well as the estimated age of certain products submitted for claims, the ultimate claim costs may differ from the recorded warranty liability. the company also establishes a reserve for product recalls on a product-specific basis during the period in which the circumstances giving rise to the recall become known and estimable for both company-initiated actions and those required by regulatory bodies.
off-balance sheet arrangement synthetic leases - the company is a party to synthetic leasing programs for certain locations, including one of its major distribution centers, as well as certain u.s. personal property, predominantly vehicles and equipment. the programs qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes, such that only the monthly rent expense is recorded in the statement of operations and the liability and value of the underlying assets are off-balance sheet.
these lease programs are utilized primarily to reduce overall cost and to retain flexibility. the cash outflows for lease payments approximate the $1 million of rent expense recognized in fiscal 2015. as of january 2, 2016 the estimated fair value of assets and remaining obligations for these properties were $40 million and $34 million, respectively.

item 1a.     risk factors.
risks related to our indebtedness we have a significant amount of debt and may incur significant additional debt, including secured debt, in the future, which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to react to changes in our business.
we have a significant amount of debt and may (subject to applicable restrictions in our debt instruments) incur additional debt in the future. as of december 31, 2015, our total principal amount of debt was approximately $35.9 billion, including $21.8 billion of debt for which proceeds are held in escrow pending consummation of the twc transaction.
our significant amount of debt could have consequences, such as:
•   impact our ability to raise additional capital at reasonable rates, or at all;
•   make us vulnerable to interest rate increases, because approximately 17% of our borrowings as of december 31, 2015 were, and may continue to be, subject to variable rates of interest;
•   expose us to increased interest expense to the extent we refinance existing debt with higher cost debt;
•   require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operating activities to make payments on our debt, reducing our funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate expenses;
•   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the cable and telecommunications industries, and the economy at large;
•   place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionately less debt; and
•   adversely affect our relationship with customers and suppliers.
if current debt amounts increase, the related risks that we now face will intensify.
the agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity.
our credit facilities and the indentures governing our debt contain a number of significant covenants that could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our liquidity, and our results of operations. these covenants restrict, among other things, our and our subsidiaries' ability to:
•   incur additional debt;
•   repurchase or redeem equity interests and debt;
•   issue equity;
•   make certain investments or acquisitions;
•   pay dividends or make other distributions;
•   dispose of assets or merge;
•   enter into related party transactions; and
•   grant liens and pledge assets.
additionally, the charter operating credit facilities require charter operating to comply with a maximum total leverage covenant and a maximum first lien leverage covenant. the breach of any covenants or obligations in our indentures or credit facilities, not otherwise waived or amended, could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could trigger cross defaults under other agreements governing our long-term indebtedness. in addition, the secured lenders under the charter operating credit facilities, cco safari iii credit facilities and the holders of the cco safari ii notes could foreclose on their collateral, which includes equity interests in our subsidiaries, and exercise other rights of secured creditors.
we depend on generating sufficient cash flow to fund our debt obligations, capital expenditures, and ongoing operations.
we are dependent on our cash on hand and cash flow from operations to fund our debt obligations, capital expenditures and ongoing operations.
20
our ability to service our debt and to fund our planned capital expenditures and ongoing operations will depend on our ability to continue to generate cash flow and our access (by dividend or otherwise) to additional liquidity sources at the applicable obligor. our ability to continue to generate cash flow is dependent on many factors, including:
•   our ability to sustain and grow revenues and cash flow from operations by offering video, internet, voice, advertising and other services to residential and commercial customers, to adequately meet the customer experience demands in our markets and to maintain and grow our customer base, particularly in the face of increasingly aggressive competition, the need for innovation and the related capital expenditures;
•   the impact of competition from other market participants, including but not limited to incumbent telephone companies, direct broadcast satellite operators, wireless broadband and telephone providers, dsl providers, video provided over the internet and providers of advertising over the internet;
•   general business conditions, economic uncertainty or downturn, high unemployment levels and the level of activity in the housing sector;
•   our ability to obtain programming at reasonable prices or to raise prices to offset, in whole or in part, the effects of higher programming costs (including retransmission consents);
•   the development and deployment of new products and technologies including our cloud-based user interface, spectrum guide®, and downloadable security for set-top boxes;
•   the effects of governmental regulation on our business or potential business combination transactions; and
•   any events that disrupt our networks, information systems or properties and impair our operating activities and negatively impact our reputation.
some of these factors are beyond our control. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or we are unable to access additional liquidity sources, we may not be able to service and repay our debt, operate our business, respond to competitive challenges, or fund our other liquidity and capital needs.
restrictions in our subsidiaries' debt instruments and under applicable law limit their ability to provide funds to us and our subsidiaries that are debt issuers.
our primary assets are our equity interests in our subsidiaries. our operating subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and are not obligated to make funds available to their debt issuer holding companies for payments on our notes or other obligations in the form of loans, distributions, or otherwise. charter operating's ability to make distributions to charter, cco holdings, ccoh safari, cco safari ii or cco safari iii, our other primary debt issuers, to service debt obligations is subject to its compliance with the terms of its credit facilities, and restrictions under applicable law. see "part ii. item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources - limitations on distributions" and "- summary of restrictive covenants of our notes - restrictions on distributions." under the delaware limited liability company act (the "act"), our subsidiaries may only make distributions if the relevant entity has "surplus" as defined in the act. under fraudulent transfer laws, our subsidiaries may not pay dividends if the relevant entity is insolvent or is rendered insolvent thereby. the measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if:
•   the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all its assets;
•   the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or
•   it could not pay its debts as they became due.
while we believe that our relevant subsidiaries currently have surplus and are not insolvent, these subsidiaries may become insolvent in the future. our direct or indirect subsidiaries include the borrowers and guarantors under the charter operating credit facilities and the entities that will be issuers and guarantors under the cco safari ii notes upon consummation of the twc transaction. cco holdings and ccoh safari are also obligors under their respective senior notes and cco safari iii is an obligor under its credit facilities. as of december 31, 2015, our total principal amount of debt was approximately $35.9 billion.
in the event of bankruptcy, liquidation, or dissolution of one or more of our subsidiaries, that subsidiary's assets would first be applied to satisfy its own obligations, and following such payments, such subsidiary may not have sufficient assets remaining to make payments to its parent company as an equity holder or otherwise. in that event, the lenders under charter operating's credit facilities, the cco safari ii notes and any other indebtedness of our subsidaries whose interests are (or will be following the consummation of the twc transaction) secured by substantially all of our operating assets, and all holders of other debt of charter operating, cco safari ii, cco safari iii, cco holdings and ccoh safari will have the right to be paid in full before us from any of our subsidiaries' assets.
21
some of our outstanding debt is subject to change of control provisions. we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to fulfill our obligations under our indebtedness following a change of control, which would place us in default under the applicable debt instruments.
we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to fulfill our obligations under our notes and our credit facilities following a change of control. under the indentures governing the cco holdings' notes and ccoh safari notes, upon the occurrence of specified change of control events, the debt issuer is required to offer to repurchase all of its outstanding notes. however, we may not have sufficient access to funds at the time of the change of control event to make the required repurchase of the applicable notes, and charter operating is limited in its ability to make distributions or other payments to any debt issuer to fund any required repurchase. in addition, a change of control under the charter operating credit facilities would result in a default under those credit facilities, which would trigger a default under the indentures governing the cco holdings' notes and cco safari ii notes. because such credit facilities and notes are obligations of charter operating and its subsidiaries, the credit facilities would have to be repaid before charter operating's assets could be available to cco holdings or ccoh safari to repurchase their notes. any failure to make or complete a change of control offer would place cco holdings or ccoh safari in default under their notes. the failure of our subsidiaries to make a change of control offer or repay the amounts accelerated under their notes and credit facilities would place them in default under such agreements.
risks related to our business we operate in a very competitive business environment, which affects our ability to attract and retain customers and can adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.
the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and has become more so in recent years. in some instances, we compete against companies with fewer regulatory burdens, better access to financing, greater personnel resources, greater resources for marketing, greater and more favorable brand name recognition, and long-established relationships with regulatory authorities and customers. increasing consolidation in the cable industry and the repeal of certain ownership rules have provided additional benefits to certain of our competitors, either through access to financing, resources, or efficiencies of scale. we could also face additional competition from multi-channel video providers if they began distributing video over the internet to customers residing outside their current territories.
our principal competitors for video services throughout our territory are dbs providers. the two largest dbs providers are directv (which is owned by at&t) and dish network. competition from dbs, including intensive marketing efforts with aggressive pricing, exclusive programming and increased hd broadcasting has had an adverse impact on our ability to retain customers. dbs companies have also expanded their activities in the mdu market.
telephone companies, including two major telephone companies, at&t and verizon, offer video and other services in competition with us, and we expect they will increasingly do so in the future. upgraded portions of these networks carry two-way video, data services and provide digital voice services similar to ours. in the case of verizon, fios high-speed data services offer speeds as high as or higher than ours. in addition, these companies continue to offer their traditional telephone services, as well as service bundles that include wireless voice services provided by affiliated companies. based on our internal estimates, we believe that at&t (excluding directv) and verizon are offering video services in areas serving approximately 35% and 4%, respectively, of our estimated residential passings and we have experienced customer losses in these areas. at&t and verizon have also launched campaigns to capture more of the mdu market. when at&t or verizon have introduced or expanded their offering of video products in our market areas, we have seen a decrease in our video revenue as at&t and verizon typically roll out aggressive marketing and discounting campaigns to launch their products. additionally, in july 2015, at&t completed its acquisition of directv, the nation's largest dbs provider and in connection with that acquisition, at&t committed to expand fiber to the premises services to 12.5 million locations. this transaction created an even larger competitor for charter's video services that has the ability to expand its video service offerings to include bundled wireless offerings.
due to consumer electronic innovations, content owners are allowing consumers to watch internet-delivered content on televisions, personal computers, tablets, gaming boxes connected to televisions and mobile devices, some without charging a fee to access the content. technological advancements, such as video on demand, new video formats, and internet streaming and downloading, have increased the number of entertainment and information delivery choices available to consumers, and intensified the challenges posed by audience fragmentation. for example, online video services continue to offer consumers alternatives including hulu, netflix, amazon and apple. in 2015, hbo and cbs began selling their programming direct to consumers over the internet. dish network launched sling tv which includes espn among other programming, and sony launched playstation vue which includes 85+ tv channels. the increasing number of choices available to audiences could also negatively impact advertisers' willingness to purchase advertising from us, as well as the price they are willing to pay for advertising.
22
with respect to our internet access services, we face competition, including intensive marketing efforts and aggressive pricing, from telephone companies, primarily at&t and verizon, and other providers of dsl, fiber-to-the-node and fiber-to-the-home services. dsl service competes with our internet service and is often offered at prices lower than our internet services, although often at speeds lower than the speeds we offer. fiber-to-the-node networks can provide faster internet speeds than conventional dsl, but still cannot typically match our internet speeds. fiber-to-the-home networks, however, can provide internet speeds equal to or greater than our current internet speeds. in addition, in many of our markets, dsl providers have entered into co-marketing arrangements with dbs providers to offer service bundles combining video services provided by a dbs provider with dsl and traditional telephone and wireless services offered by the telephone companies and their affiliates. these service bundles offer customers similar pricing and convenience advantages as our bundles.
continued growth in our residential voice business faces risks. the competitive landscape for residential and commercial telephone services is intense; we face competition from providers of internet telephone services, as well as incumbent telephone companies. further, we face increasing competition for residential voice services as more consumers in the united states are replacing traditional telephone service with wireless service. we expect to continue to price our voice product aggressively as part of our triple play strategy which could negatively impact our revenue from voice services to the extent we do not increase volume.
the existence of more than one cable system operating in the same territory is referred to as an overbuild. overbuilds could adversely affect our growth, financial condition, and results of operations, by creating or increasing competition. we are aware of traditional overbuild situations impacting certain of our markets, however, we are unable to predict the extent to which additional overbuild situations may occur.
in order to attract new customers, from time to time we make promotional offers, including offers of temporarily reduced price or free service. these promotional programs result in significant advertising, programming and operating expenses, and also may require us to make capital expenditures to acquire and install customer premise equipment. customers who subscribe to our services as a result of these offerings may not remain customers following the end of the promotional period. a failure to retain customers could have a material adverse effect on our business.
mergers, joint ventures, and alliances among franchised, wireless, or private cable operators, dbs providers, local exchange carriers, and others, may provide additional benefits to some of our competitors, either through access to financing, resources, or efficiencies of scale, or the ability to provide multiple services in direct competition with us.
in addition to the various competitive factors discussed above, our business competes with all other sources of entertainment and information delivery, including broadcast television, movies, live events, radio broadcasts, home video products, console games, print media, and the internet. if we do not respond appropriately to further increases in the leisure and entertainment choices available to consumers, our competitive position could deteriorate, and our financial results could suffer.
our services may not allow us to compete effectively. competition may reduce our expected growth of future cash flows which may contribute to future impairments of our franchises and goodwill and our ability to meet cash flow requirements, including debt service requirements.
our exposure to the economic conditions of our current and potential customers, vendors and third parties could adversely affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.
we are exposed to risks associated with the economic conditions of our current and potential customers, the potential financial instability of our customers and their financial ability to purchase our products. if there were a general economic downtown, we may experience increased cancellations by our customers or unfavorable changes in the mix of products purchased. these events have adversely affected us in the past, and may adversely affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition if a downturn were to occur.
in addition, we are susceptible to risks associated with the potential financial instability of the vendors and third parties on which we rely to provide products and services or to which we outsource certain functions. the same economic conditions that may affect our customers, as well as volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets, also could adversely affect vendors and third parties and lead to significant increases in prices, reduction in output or the bankruptcy of our vendors or third parties upon which we rely. any interruption in the services provided by our vendors or by third parties could adversely affect our cash flow, results of operation and financial condition.
23
we face risks inherent in our commercial business.
we may encounter unforeseen difficulties as we increase the scale of our service offerings to businesses. we sell internet access, data networking and fiber connectivity to cellular towers and office buildings, video and business voice services to businesses and have increased our focus on growing this business. in order to grow our commercial business, we expect to continue investment in technology, equipment and personnel focused on the commercial business. commercial business customers often require service level agreements and generally have heightened customer expectations for reliability of services. if our efforts to build the infrastructure to scale the commercial business are not successful, the growth of our commercial services business would be limited. we depend on interconnection and related services provided by certain third parties for the growth of our commercial business. as a result, our ability to implement changes as the services grow may be limited. if we are unable to meet these service level requirements or expectations, our commercial business could be adversely affected. finally, we expect advances in communications technology, as well as changes in the marketplace and the regulatory and legislative environment. consequently, we are unable to predict the effect that ongoing or future developments in these areas might have on our voice and commercial businesses and operations.
programming costs are rising at a much faster rate than wages or inflation, and we may not have the ability to reduce or moderate the growth rates of, or pass on to our customers, our increasing programming costs, which would adversely affect our cash flow and operating margins.
programming has been, and is expected to continue to be, our largest operating expense item. in recent years, the cable industry has experienced a rapid escalation in the cost of programming. we expect programming costs to continue to increase because of a variety of factors including amounts paid for retransmission consent, annual increases imposed by programmers with additional selling power as a result of media consolidation, incremental programming, including new sports services, out-of-home or non-linear programming and attempts by programmers to replace advertising revenue they are losing to online marketing options and as a result of declining viewership ratings. the inability to fully pass these programming cost increases on to our customers has had an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating margins associated with the video product. we have programming contracts that have expired and others that will expire at or before the end of 2016. there can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms. to the extent that we are unable to reach agreement with certain programmers on terms that we believe are reasonable, we may be forced to remove such programming channels from our line-up, which could result in a further loss of customers.
increased demands by owners of some broadcast stations for carriage of other services or payments to those broadcasters for retransmission consent are likely to further increase our programming costs. federal law allows commercial television broadcast stations to make an election between "must-carry" rights and an alternative "retransmission-consent" regime. when a station opts for the latter, cable operators are not allowed to carry the station's signal without the station's permission. in some cases, we carry stations under short-term arrangements while we attempt to negotiate new long-term retransmission agreements. if negotiations with these programmers prove unsuccessful, they could require us to cease carrying their signals, possibly for an indefinite period. any loss of stations could make our video service less attractive to customers, which could result in less subscription and advertising revenue. in retransmission-consent negotiations, broadcasters often condition consent with respect to one station on carriage of one or more other stations or programming services in which they or their affiliates have an interest. carriage of these other services, as well as increased fees for retransmission rights, may increase our programming expenses and diminish the amount of capacity we have available to introduce new services, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
our inability to respond to technological developments and meet customer demand for new products and services could limit our ability to compete effectively.
our business is characterized by rapid technological change and the introduction of new products and services, some of which are bandwidth-intensive. we may not be able to fund the capital expenditures necessary to keep pace with technological developments, execute the plans to do so, or anticipate the demand of our customers for products and services requiring new technology or bandwidth. the implementation of our network-based user interface, spectrum guide, and downloadable security necessary for our worldbox set-top box strategy, may ultimately be unsuccessful or more expensive than anticipated. in order to realize the benefits of our worldbox technology, we must implement our downloadable conditional access security in our regional video networks. our inability to maintain and expand our upgraded systems and provide advanced services such as a state of the art user interface in a timely manner, or to anticipate the demands of the marketplace, could materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers. consequently, our growth, financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially.
24
we depend on third party service providers, suppliers and licensors; thus, if we are unable to procure the necessary services, equipment, software or licenses on reasonable terms and on a timely basis, our ability to offer services could be impaired, and our growth, operations, business, financial results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
we depend on third party service providers, suppliers and licensors to supply some of the services, hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide some of our services. we obtain these materials from a limited number of vendors, some of which do not have a long operating history or which may not be able to continue to supply the equipment and services we desire. some of our hardware, software and operational support vendors, and service providers represent our sole source of supply or have, either through contract or as a result of intellectual property rights, a position of some exclusivity. if demand exceeds these vendors' capacity or if these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties, or are otherwise unable to provide the equipment or services we need in a timely manner, at our specifications and at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some services might be materially adversely affected, or the need to procure or develop alternative sources of the affected materials or services might delay our ability to serve our customers. these events could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain and attract customers, and have a material negative impact on our operations, business, financial results and financial condition. a limited number of vendors of key technologies can lead to less product innovation and higher costs. our cable systems have historically been restricted to using one of two proprietary conditional access security systems, which we believe has limited the number of manufacturers producing set-top boxes for such systems. as an alternative, charter has developed a conditional access security system which may be downloaded into set-top boxes with features we specify that could be provided by a variety of manufacturers. we refer to our specified set-top box as our worldbox. in order to realize the benefits of our worldbox technology, we must now implement the conditional access security system across our video network. we cannot provide assurances that this implementation will ultimately be successful or completed in the expected timeframe or at the expected budget.
we further depend on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and licenses to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in technology and the products and services used in our operating activities. any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged or invalidated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to continue to use certain intellectual property, which could result in discontinuance of certain product or service offerings or other competitive harm, our incurring substantial monetary liability or being enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question.
various events could disrupt our networks, information systems or properties and could impair our operating activities and negatively impact our reputation.
network and information systems technologies are critical to our operating activities, as well as our customers' access to our services. we may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions. malicious and abusive activities, such as the dissemination of computer viruses, worms, and other destructive or disruptive software, computer hackings, social engineering, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks and other malicious activities have become more common in industry overall.  if directed at us or technologies upon which we depend, these activities could have adverse consequences on our network and our customers, including degradation of service, excessive call volume to call centers, and damage to our or our customers' equipment and data.  further, these activities could result in security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems and networks, and in our vendors' systems and networks, including customer, personnel and vendor data. system failures and network disruptions may also be caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions or telecommunications failures. if a significant incident were to occur, it could damage our reputation and credibility, lead to customer dissatisfaction and, ultimately, loss of customers or revenue, in addition to increased costs to service our customers and protect our network. these events also could result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties, networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future. system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities.  any significant loss of customers or revenue, or significant increase in costs of serving those customers, could adversely affect our growth, financial condition and results of operations.
for tax purposes, we could experience a deemed ownership change in the future that could limit our ability to use our tax loss carryforwards.
as of december 31, 2015, we had approximately $11.3 billion of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a gross deferred tax asset of approximately $4.0 billion. federal tax net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2020 through 2035. these losses resulted from the operations of charter holdco and its subsidiaries. in addition, as of december 31, 2015, we had state tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a gross deferred tax asset (net of federal tax benefit) of approximately $365 million. state tax net operating loss carryforwards generally expire in the years 2016 through 2035. due to uncertainties in projected future taxable income, valuation allowances have been established against the gross deferred tax assets for book
25
accounting purposes, except for future taxable income that will result from the reversal of existing temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities are recognized. such tax loss carryforwards can accumulate and be used to offset our future taxable income.
in the past, we have experienced "ownership changes" as defined in section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). in general, an "ownership change" occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by "5-percent stockholders" (within the meaning of section 382 of the code) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by such "5-percent stockholders" at any time over the preceding three years. as a result, charter is, and following the twc transactions, new charter (or, if only the bright house transaction is completed, charter) will be subject to an annual limitation on the use of our loss carryforwards which existed at november 30, 2009 for the first "ownership change" and those that existed at may 1, 2013 for the second "ownership change." the limitation on our ability to use our loss carryforwards, in conjunction with the loss carryforward expiration provisions, could reduce our ability to use a portion of our loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income, which could result in us being required to make material cash tax payments. our ability to make such income tax payments, if any, will depend at such time on our liquidity or our ability to raise additional capital, and/or on receipt of payments or distributions from charter holdco and its subsidiaries.
if we were to experience a third ownership change in the future (as a result of the transactions with twc, bright house and liberty broadband or from purchases and sales of stock by our "5-percent stockholders," new issuances or redemptions of our stock, certain acquisitions of our stock and issuances, redemptions, sales or other dispositions or acquisitions of interests in our "5-percent stockholders"), our ability to use our loss carryforwards could become subject to further limitations. our common stock is subject to certain transfer restrictions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. these restrictions, which are designed to minimize the likelihood of an ownership change occurring and thereby preserve our ability to utilize our loss carryforwards, are not currently operative but could become operative in the future if certain events occur and the restrictions are imposed by our board of directors. however, there can be no assurance that our board of directors would choose to impose these restrictions or that such restrictions, if imposed, would prevent an ownership change from occurring. these restrictions will be eliminated if the bright house transaction is consummated.
if we are unable to retain key employees, our ability to manage our business could be adversely affected.
our operational results have depended, and our future results will depend, upon the retention and continued performance of our management team. our ability to retain and hire new key employees for management positions could be impacted adversely by the competitive environment for management talent in the broadband communications industry. the loss of the services of key members of management and the inability or delay in hiring new key employees could adversely affect our ability to manage our business and our future operational and financial results.
our inability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses, assets, products or technologies could harm our operating results.
we continuously evaluate and pursue small and large acquisitions and strategic investments in businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our business or otherwise offer growth or cost-saving opportunities. from time to time, we may enter into letters of intent with companies with which we are negotiating for potential acquisitions or investments, or as to which we are conducting due diligence. an investment in, or acquisition of, complementary businesses, products or technologies in the future could materially decrease the amount of our available cash or require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. we may not be successful in negotiating the terms of any potential acquisition, conducting thorough due diligence, financing the acquisition or effectively integrating the acquired business, product or technology into our existing business and operations. our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business, product or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, product quality or product architecture, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, or employee or customer issues.
additionally, in connection with any acquisitions we complete, we may not achieve the growth, synergies or other benefits we expected to achieve, and we may incur write-downs, impairment charges or unforeseen liabilities that could negatively affect our operating results or financial position or could otherwise harm our business. further, contemplating or completing an acquisition and integrating an acquired business, product or technology, individually or across multiple opportunities, could divert management and employee time and resources from other matters. see "- risks related to the twc transaction and bright house transaction" for risks specifically related to our proposed acquisitions of twc and bright house.
26
risks related to ownership position of liberty broadband corporation liberty broadband corporation owns a significant amount of charter's common stock, giving it influence over corporate transactions and other matters.
members of our board of directors include directors who are also officers and directors of our stockholder with the largest ownership. dr. john malone is the chairman of liberty broadband, and mr. greg maffei is the president and chief executive officer of liberty broadband. as of december 31, 2015, liberty broadband beneficially held approximately 25.65% of our class a common stock. liberty broadband has the right to designate up to four directors as nominees for our board of directors through our 2015 annual meeting of stockholders with one designated director to be appointed to each of the audit committee, the nominating and corporate governance committee and the compensation and benefits committee. liberty broadband may be able to exercise substantial influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate action, such as mergers and other business combination transactions should liberty broadband retain a significant ownership interest in us.  liberty broadband and its affiliates are not restricted from investing in, and have invested in, and engaged in, other businesses involving or related to the operation of cable television systems, video programming, internet service, voice or business and financial transactions conducted through broadband interactivity and internet services.  liberty broadband and its affiliates may also engage in other businesses that compete or may in the future compete with us.
liberty broadband's substantial influence over our management and affairs could create conflicts of interest if liberty broadband faced decisions that could have different implications for it and us.
risks related to the twc transaction and the bright house transaction in the event (i) only the twc transaction or the twc transaction and the bright house transaction are completed, former charter stockholders (excluding liberty broadband) will have significantly lower ownership and voting interest in new charter following the completion of such transactions than they currently have in charter and will exercise less influence over management, or (ii) only the bright house transaction is completed, existing charter stockholders (excluding liberty broadband) will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in charter following the completion of the bright house transaction than they currently have in charter and will exercise less influence over management.
based on the number of shares of twc common stock outstanding as of december 31, 2015, and the number of shares of charter class a common stock outstanding as of december 31, 2015, it is expected that, immediately after completion of the twc transaction, the issuance of shares to liberty broadband and the completion of the bright house transaction, and depending on the outcome of the election feature contained in the merger agreement, former charter stockholders (excluding liberty broadband) are expected to own between approximately 26% and 24% of new charter class a common stock, former twc stockholders (excluding liberty broadband) are expected to own between approximately 41% and 45% of new charter class a common stock, a/n is expected to own indirectly (on an as-converted, as-exchanged basis) between approximately 14% and 13% of new charter class a common stock and liberty broadband is expected to own between approximately 19% and 17% of new charter class a common stock. if only the twc transaction is completed, it is expected that former charter stockholders (excluding liberty broadband) will own between approximately 30% and 28% of new charter class a common stock, former twc stockholders (excluding liberty broadband) will own between approximately 48% and 52% of new charter class a common stock and liberty broadband will own between approximately 22% and 20% of new charter class a common stock. in connection with the twc transaction, each twc stockholder and charter stockholder will become a stockholder of new charter with a percentage ownership of new charter that is significantly smaller than the stockholder's percentage ownership in twc and charter, respectively. charter stockholders currently have the right to vote for their board of directors and on other matters affecting the applicable company. consequently, former charter stockholders (excluding liberty broadband) will be able to exercise less influence over the management, operations and policies of new charter after the twc transaction (and the bright house transaction, if applicable) than they currently exercise over the management, operations and policies of charter.
if only the bright house transaction is completed, it is expected that following the bright house transaction existing charter stockholders (excluding liberty broadband) will own approximately 52% of charter class a common stock, liberty broadband will own approximately 20% of charter class a common stock and a/n will indirectly own (on an as-converted, as exchanged basis) approximately 28% of charter class a common stock. charter stockholders currently have the right to vote for their board of directors and on other matters affecting charter. consequently, assuming the twc transaction is not completed but the bright house transaction is completed, existing charter stockholders (excluding liberty broadband) will be able to exercise less influence over the management, operations and policies of charter after the bright house transaction than they currently exercise over the management, operations and policies of charter.

in order to complete the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction, charter along with twc and bright house must obtain certain governmental authorizations, and if such authorizations are not made or granted or are granted with conditions to the parties, completion of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction may be jeopardized or the anticipated benefits of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction could be reduced.
the completion of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction are each conditioned upon, among other things, the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting periods under the hsr act and the required governmental authorizations, including an order of the fcc with respect to the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction, having been obtained and being in full force and effect. although charter and twc have agreed in the merger agreement, and charter and bright house have agreed in the contribution agreement, to use reasonable best efforts, subject to certain limitations, to obtain the required governmental authorizations, there can be no assurance that the relevant waiting periods will expire or that the relevant authorizations will be obtained. in addition, the governmental authorities with or from which these authorizations are required generally have broad discretion in administering the governing regulations. as a condition to authorization of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction, these governmental authorities may impose requirements, limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company's business after completion of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction. under the terms of each of the merger agreement and contribution agreement, subject to certain exceptions, charter and its subsidiaries are required to accept certain conditions and take certain actions imposed by governmental authorities and accept any other remedies to the extent such actions, conditions or other remedies would not constitute a burdensome condition. there can be no assurance that regulators will not impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying completion of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction or imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of new charter (or, if only the bright house transaction is completed, charter) following the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction, or otherwise adversely affecting the business and results of operations of new charter or charter, as applicable, after completion of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction. in addition, there can be no assurance that these conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction.
new charter (or, if only the bright house transaction is completed, charter) may not realize anticipated cost synergies and growth opportunities.
new charter (or, if only the bright house transaction is completed, charter) expects to realize cost synergies, growth opportunities and other financial and operating benefits as a result of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction. the combined company's success in realizing these cost synergies, growth opportunities and other financial and operating benefits, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of the business operations obtained in the twc transaction and the bright house transaction. even if new charter or charter, as applicable, is able to integrate the business operations obtained in the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction successfully, it is not possible to predict with certainty if or when these cost synergies, growth opportunities and benefits will occur, or the extent to which they actually will be achieved. for example, the benefits from the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction may be offset by costs incurred in integrating the new business operations or in obtaining or attempting to obtain regulatory approvals for the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction, or increased operating costs that may be experienced as a result of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction. realization of any benefits and cost synergies could be affected by the factors described in other risk factors and a number of factors beyond new charter's or charter's control, as applicable, including, without limitation, general economic conditions, increased operating costs, the response of competitors and vendors and regulatory developments.
if new charter (or, if only the bright house transaction is completed, charter) is not able to successfully integrate charter's business with that of twc and/or bright house within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the twc transaction and/or bright house transaction may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. in such circumstances, in the event the twc transaction (and, if applicable, the bright house transaction) are completed, new charter may not perform as expected and the value of the new charter class a common stock (including the merger consideration) may be adversely affected.
charter, twc and bright house have operated and, until completion of the twc transaction and/or bright house transaction will continue to operate, independently, and there can be no assurances that their businesses can be integrated successfully. after consummation of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction the combined company will have significantly more systems, assets, investments, businesses, customers and employees than each company did prior to the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction. it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key charter, twc and/or bright house employees, the loss of subscribers and customers, the disruption of the companies' ongoing businesses or in unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. the process of integrating twc, bright house, or twc and bright house, with the businesses charter operated prior to the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction will require significant capital expenditures and the
28
expansion of certain operations and operating and financial systems. management of each company will be required to devote a significant amount of time and attention to the integration process before the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction is completed. there is a significant degree of difficulty and management involvement inherent in that process. these difficulties include:
•   integrating the companies' operations and corporate functions;
•   integrating the companies' technologies, networks and customer service platforms;
•   integrating and unifying the product offerings and services available to customers;
•   harmonizing the companies' operating practices, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls and other policies, procedures and processes;
•   maintaining existing relationships and agreements with customers, providers, programmers and other vendors and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers, providers and vendors;
•   addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies;
•   consolidating the companies' administrative and information technology infrastructure;
•   coordinating programming and marketing efforts;
•   coordinating geographically dispersed organizations;
•   integrating information, purchasing, provisioning, accounting, finance, sales, billing, payroll, reporting and regulatory compliance systems;
•   integrating and unifying the product offerings and services available to customers, including customer premise equipment and video user interfaces;
•   completing the conversion of analog systems to all-digital for the systems to be acquired from twc and bright house;
•   managing a significantly larger company than before the completion of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction; and
•   attracting and retaining the necessary personnel associated with the acquired assets.
even if the new businesses are successfully integrated, it may not be possible to realize the benefits that are expected to result from the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction, or realize these benefits within the time frame that is expected. for example, the elimination of duplicative costs may not be possible or may take longer than anticipated, or the benefits from the twc transaction and/or bright house transaction may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating the businesses and increased operating costs. if the combined company fails to realize the anticipated benefits from the transactions, its liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and/or share price may be adversely affected. in addition, at times, the attention of certain members of charter's, twc's and/or bright house's management and resources may be focused on the completion of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction and the integration of the businesses and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt each company's business and the business of the combined company.
the substantial indebtedness that will be incurred by new charter in connection with the twc transaction and/or bright house transaction could adversely affect new charter's operations and financial condition after the twc transaction and the bright house transaction.
as of december 31, 2015, our total principal amount of debt was approximately $35.9 billion, including $21.8 billion of debt for which proceeds are held in escrow pending consummation of the twc transaction. new charter's and its subsidiaries' indebtedness could have negative consequences to new charter after the twc transaction and/or bright house transaction, such as:
•   requiring new charter to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operating activities to payments on its indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, potential strategic acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;
•   limiting new charter's ability to obtain additional financing to fund growth, working capital or capital expenditures, or to fulfill debt service requirements or other cash requirements;
•   exposing new charter to increased interest expense to the extent new charter refinances existing debt with higher cost debt;
•   to the extent that new charter's debt is subject to floating interest rates, increasing new charter's vulnerability to fluctuations in market interest rates;
•   placing new charter at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have less debt;
•   adversely affecting new charter's relationship with customers and suppliers;
•   limiting new charter's flexibility to pursue other strategic opportunities or in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business, the cable and telecommunications industries, and the economy at large; and
•   limiting new charter's ability to buy back new charter class a common stock or pay cash dividends.
if current debt amounts increase, the related risks that charter now faces may intensify.
29
because of high debt levels, new charter may not be able to service its debt obligations in accordance with their terms after the twc transaction and/or bright house transaction.
new charter's ability to meet its expense and debt service obligations contained in the agreements governing new charter's indebtedness will depend on its future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, including potential changes in customer preferences, the success of product and marketing innovation and pressure from competitors. should new charter's revenues decline after the twc transaction and/or bright house transaction, it may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay its debt service obligations when due. if new charter is unable to meet its debt service obligations after the twc transaction and/or bright house transaction or should it fail to comply with its financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the agreements governing new charter's indebtedness, new charter may be required to refinance all or part of its debt, sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices or borrow more money. new charter may not be able to, at any given time, refinance its debt, sell assets or borrow more money on terms acceptable to new charter or at all. the inability of new charter to refinance its debt could have a material adverse effect on new charter's financial condition and results from operations after the twc transaction and/or bright house transaction.
new charter will be dependent on an equity financing from liberty broadband to partially finance the twc transaction.
charter plans to use the proceeds of $4.3 billion from the purchase by liberty broadband of new charter class a common stock to partially fund the twc transaction. liberty broadband will primarily rely on proceeds from third-party investors to fund the investment in new charter class a common stock, and liberty broadband has secured commitments for such financing through investment agreements with such third parties. charter cannot guarantee that liberty broadband will successfully complete these transactions with such third-party investors. the twc transaction is not conditioned on the receipt of financing, including financing from liberty broadband.
charter, twc and bright house may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other employees in light of the twc transaction and the bright house transaction.
uncertainty about the effect of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction on charter, twc and bright house employees may impair charter's, twc's and bright house's ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel prior to and following the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction. employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction, as employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined business. in addition, certain employees potentially could terminate their employment for good reason and collect severance if certain specified circumstances set forth in their employment agreements occur following the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction, including certain changes in such employees' duties, position, compensation and benefits or primary office location. if employees of charter, twc or bright house depart, the integration of the companies may be more difficult and the combined company's business following the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction may be harmed. furthermore, new charter (or, if only the bright house transaction is completed, charter) may have to incur significant costs in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent relating to the businesses of charter, twc and/or bright house, and the combined company's ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction may be adversely affected. in addition, there could be disruptions to or distractions for the workforce and management associated with activities of labor unions or integrating employees into new charter.
a delay in the completion of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction may diminish the anticipated benefits of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction.
completion of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction is conditioned upon the receipt of certain governmental consents and approvals, orders, authorizations, and rulings, including the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period (or extension thereof) under the hsr act and the adoption of an order, by the fcc and any other requisite governmental entity granting its consent to the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction. the requirement to receive these consents and approvals, orders, authorizations and rulings before the twc transaction could delay the completion of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction if, for example, government agencies request additional information from the parties in order to facilitate their review of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction or require any conditions precedent to granting their approval of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction. in addition, these governmental agencies may attempt to condition their approval of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction on the imposition of conditions that could have a material adverse effect on new charter (or, if only the bright house transaction is completed, charter) after the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction, including but not limited to its operating results or the value of new charter class a common stock (or, if only the bright house transaction is completed, charter class a common stock). any delay
30
in the completion of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction could diminish the anticipated benefits of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction or result in additional transaction costs, including interest expense for debt incurred in anticipation of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction, loss of revenue or other effects associated with uncertainty about the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction. any uncertainty over the ability of the companies to complete the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction could make it more difficult for charter, twc and bright house to retain key employees or to pursue business strategies.
prior to the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction, charter, twc and/or bright house, as applicable, and after the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction, the combined company, will incur significant transaction-related costs in connection with the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction.
prior to the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction, charter, twc and/or bright house, as applicable, and after the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction, the combined company, expect to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction before, at, and after closing the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction. if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, charter will be required to pay to twc certain termination fees. charter and/or new charter also will incur transaction fees and costs related to financing (including interest and fees with any pre-funding of the consideration to be paid in the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction) and formulating and implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems implementation costs and employment-related costs. some of these costs have already been incurred or may be incurred regardless of whether the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction is completed, including a portion of the fees and expenses of financial advisors and other advisors and representatives and filing fees for the proxy statement. while many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time, management of charter continues to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in connection with the twc transaction and integration. there are a number of factors beyond the control of the parties that could affect the total amount or the timing of all of the expected integration expenses. although the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. these integration expenses may result in charter and/or new charter taking significant charges against earnings following the completion of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction. in addition, if the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction is not consummated, charter will bear some or all of these costs without the benefit of efficiencies from the integration of the businesses. such costs could have a material adverse impact on charter and/or new charter's financial results.
sales of new charter class a common stock after the twc transaction (and, if completed, the bright house transaction) may negatively affect the market price of new charter class a common stock.
the shares of new charter class a common stock to be issued in the twc transaction to holders of twc common stock will generally be eligible for immediate resale. the market price of new charter class a common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of new charter class a common stock in the market after the consummation of the twc transaction (and, if completed, the bright house transaction) or even the perception that these sales could occur.
charter's, twc's and bright house's business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction.
parties with which charter, twc or bright house do business may experience uncertainty associated with the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction, including with respect to current or future business relationships with charter, twc, bright house or the combined business. charter's, twc's and bright house's business relationships may be subject to disruption as customers, distributors, suppliers, vendors and others may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties excluding charter, twc, bright house or the combined business. these disruptions, which may exist for an extended period of time if completion of the twc transaction (and, if completed, the bright house transaction) is delayed, could have an adverse effect on the businesses, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of the combined business, including an adverse effect on new charter's ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the twc transaction (and, if completed, the bright house transaction). the risk, and adverse effect, of such disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction or termination of the merger agreement and/or the bright house contribution agreement.
31
failure to complete the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction could negatively impact the stock price and the future business and financial results of charter.
if the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction is not completed for any reason, the ongoing business of charter may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction, charter would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:
•   charter may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on its stock price;
•   charter may experience negative reactions from its customers, regulators and employees;
•   charter will be required to pay certain costs relating to the twc transaction, whether or not the twc transaction is completed and charter will be required to pay certain costs relating to the bright house transaction, whether or not the bright house transaction is completed;
•   the merger agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of twc's and charter's businesses prior to completion of the twc transaction; such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of the other party (in certain cases, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), may prevent twc and charter from making certain acquisitions, taking certain other specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the twc transaction;
•   the contribution agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of charter's business prior to completion of the bright house transaction; such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of a/n (in certain cases, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), may prevent charter from taking certain specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the bright house transaction; and
•   matters relating to the twc transaction (and with respect to charter only, matters relating to the bright house contribution), including integration planning, will require substantial commitments of time and resources by charter and twc management, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to either charter or twc as an independent company.
if the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction is not completed, the risks described above may materialize and they may adversely affect charter's business, financial condition, financial results and stock price.
in addition, charter and twc could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against charter or twc to perform their respective obligations under the merger agreement or against charter to perform it obligations under the contribution agreement.
if the operating results of twc and/or bright house before or following the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction is less than charter's and/or new charter's expectations, or an increase in the capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain those assets as well as to keep pace with technological developments are greater than expected, new charter (or, if only the bright house transaction is completed, charter) may not achieve the expected level of financial results from the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction.
new charter (or, if only the bright house transaction is completed, charter) will derive a portion of its revenues and earnings per share from the operation of twc and/or bright house following completion of the twc transaction and/or bright house transaction. therefore, any negative impact on these companies or the operating results derived from such companies could harm the combined company's operating results.
the businesses of charter, twc, bright house and new charter are characterized by rapid technological change and the introduction of new products and services. new charter (or, if only the bright house transaction is completed, charter) intends to make investments in the combined business following the completion of the twc transaction and/or the bright house transaction and transition toward only using two-way all-digital set-top boxes. the increase in capital expenditures necessary for the transition toward two-way set-top boxes in the business may negatively impact the expected financial results from the twc transaction and/or bright house transaction. the combined company may not be able to fund the capital expenditures necessary to keep pace with technological developments, execute the plans to do so, or anticipate the demand of its customers for products and services requiring new technology or bandwidth. new charter's (or, if only the bright house transaction is completed, charter's) inability to maintain, expand and upgrade its existing or combined businesses could materially adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.
the twc transaction and the bright house transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition by new charter in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of twc and bright house will be recorded, as of the date of completion of the twc transaction, the bright house transaction and liberty transactions, at their respective fair values and added to those of charter. the reported financial condition
32
and results of operations of new charter issued after completion of the twc transaction, the bright house transaction and liberty transactions will reflect new charter balances and results after completion of the twc transaction, the bright house transaction and liberty transactions, but will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of new charter for periods prior to the twc transaction, the bright house transaction and liberty transactions. under the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price will be allocated to twc's and bright house's tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets based on their fair values as of the date of completion of the twc transaction, the bright house transaction and liberty transactions.
the excess of the purchase price over those fair values will be recorded as goodwill. charter, twc and bright house expect that the twc transaction and the bright house transaction will result in the creation of goodwill based upon the application of the acquisition method of accounting. to the extent the value of goodwill or intangibles becomes impaired, new charter may be required to incur material charges relating to such impairment. such a potential impairment charge could have a material impact on new charter's operating results.
risks related to the twc transaction completion of the twc transaction is subject to a number of conditions and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the twc transaction will not be completed.
the obligations of charter and twc to complete the twc transaction is subject to satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including, among others:
•   expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period (or extension thereof) under the hsr act relating to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (solely with respect to the obligations of each of charter, new charter, merger subsidiary one, merger subsidiary two and merger subsidiary three to complete the twc transaction, without the imposition of any burdensome condition);
•   (i) adoption of an order, and release of the full text thereof, by the fcc granting its consent to the transfer of control or assignment of the licenses issued by the fcc to twc or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, (ii) approval of certain lfas, such that the sum of the aggregate number of video subscribers of twc belonging to franchise areas for which either (x) no lfa consent is required or (y) if lfa consent is required, such consent shall have been obtained, shall be no less than 85% of the aggregate number of video subscribers of twc and (iii) authorizations of state public utilities commissions whose consent is required in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (solely with respect to the obligations of each of charter, new charter, merger subsidiary one, merger subsidiary two and merger subsidiary three to complete the twc transaction, in each case without the imposition of any burdensome condition);
•   except for the conditions described in the two preceding bullets, (i) absence of (x) any applicable law of a governmental authority of competent jurisdiction enacted or promulgated after the date of the merger agreement in a jurisdiction in which any of charter, twc or their respective subsidiaries has substantial operations and (y) any order of a governmental authority of competent jurisdiction that, in each case, (1) imposes any burdensome condition or (2) prohibits completion of the twc transaction and the violation of which would result in criminal liability, and (ii) the absence of any injunction (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) by any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction that imposes a burdensome condition or prohibits completion of the twc transaction;
•   approval for the listing on nasdaq of the shares of new charter class a common stock to be issued in the twc transaction, subject only to official notice of issuance;
•   accuracy of the representations and warranties made in the merger agreement by the other party, subject to certain materiality thresholds;
•   performance in all material respects by the other party of the material obligations required to be performed by it at or prior to completion of the twc transaction;
•   the absence of a material adverse effect on the other party;
•   receipt of a certificate executed by an executive officer of the other party as to the satisfaction of the conditions described in the preceding three bullets with respect to such other party; and
•   delivery of opinions of wachtell, lipton, rosen &amp; katz, in the case of charter, and paul, weiss, rifkind, wharton &amp; garrison llp, in the case of twc, with respect to certain tax aspects of the twc transaction.
there can be no assurance that the conditions to closing of the twc transaction will be satisfied or waived or that the twc transaction will be completed. there can be no assurance that these conditions will not result in the abandonment or delay of the twc transaction. the occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on the companies' results of operations and the trading price of the twc common stock or charter class a common stock.
33
the twc transaction is not conditioned upon completion of the bright house transaction or the issuance of shares to a/n. the twc transaction and the bright house transaction is subject to separate conditions, and the twc transaction may be completed whether or not the bright house transaction is ultimately consummated.
the market price of new charter class a common stock after the twc transaction (and, if completed, the bright house transaction) may be affected by factors different from those affecting shares of charter or twc common stock currently.
upon completion of the twc transaction, holders of charter class a common stock will become holders of shares of new charter class a common stock. the businesses of charter differ from those of twc in important respects, including the following:
•   differences in product penetration and mix, including different approaches to pricing and packaging;
•   differences in the geographic operating areas served by charter, twc and bright house as well as different presences in those areas, different structures and different competitive factors in those areas;
•   differences in the technology platforms and physical plant and property used to deliver the companies' respective products and services, including that charter's platform has generally been converted to all digital;
•   differences in the companies' corporate and organizational structure;
•   twc engages in telecom and internet infrastructure businesses, including through its subsidiary dukenet communications;
•   twc engages in information technology ("it") and cloud businesses, including through its navisite subsidiary, outsourced it solutions and cloud services;
•   twc operates and distributes regional sports networks and local sports, news and lifestyle channels; and
•   differences in the potential tax treatment of historical transactions of both charter and twc.
accordingly, the results of operations, including capital expenditures, of new charter after the twc transaction (and, if completed, the bright house transaction), as well as the market price of new charter class a common stock, may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the results of operations, including capital expenditures, of charter and twc currently.
the shares of new charter class a common stock to be received by twc and charter stockholders as a result of the twc transaction will have different rights from shares of twc common stock and charter class a common stock previously held by such stockholders.
following completion of the twc transaction, twc and charter stockholders will no longer be stockholders of twc and charter, respectively, but will instead be stockholders of new charter. there are important differences between the rights of twc and charter stockholders and the rights of new charter stockholders.
litigation has been filed against charter, twc, the twc board of directors and the merger subsidiaries. an adverse ruling in such lawsuit may result in the payment of damages following completion of the twc transaction.
litigation has been filed against charter, charter's board of directors, twc, the twc board of directors and the merger subsidiaries in connection with the twc transaction, which could result in substantial costs to charter, twc, and/or new charter. see "part i, item 3. legal proceedings" for more information.
risks related to the bright house transaction and liberty transactions liberty broadband currently has governance rights that give it influence over corporate transactions and other matters. in connection with the bright house transaction, liberty broadband's governance rights will be modified and a/n will receive governance rights pursuant to the bright house/liberty stockholders agreement and amendments to new charter's or charter's governing documents, as applicable, and liberty broadband and a/n will have influence over corporate transactions and other matters.
liberty broadband currently owns a significant amount of charter class a common stock and is entitled to certain governance rights with respect to charter. members of the charter board of directors include directors who are also officers and directors of liberty broadband. dr. john malone is the chairman of liberty broadband, and mr. greg maffei is the president and chief executive officer of liberty broadband. as of december 31, 2015, liberty broadband beneficially held approximately 25.65% of charter class a common stock. pursuant to the stockholders agreement between liberty broadband and charter dated march 19, 2013, as amended on october 14, 2014, liberty broadband has the right to designate up to four directors as nominees for charter's board of directors through charter's 2015 annual meeting of stockholders with one designated director to be appointed to each of the audit committee, the nominating and corporate governance committee and the compensation and benefits committee.

in connection with the bright house transaction, charter and new charter entered into the bright house/liberty stockholders agreement with a/n and liberty broadband, which will supersede the existing stockholders agreement in its entirety upon the earlier to occur of the closing of the twc transaction and the closing of the bright house transaction, unless the bright house contribution agreement is terminated prior to the closing of the bright house transaction. following the closing of the twc transaction and the bright house transaction, charter expects that liberty broadband will have an equity interest of between approximately 19% and 17% and a/n will have an equity interest of between approximately 14% and 13%, in each case on an as-converted, as-exchanged basis, in new charter. in connection with the twc transaction, liberty broadband and liberty interactive entered into a proxy and right of first refusal agreement, pursuant to which, in connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, liberty interactive will grant liberty broadband an irrevocable proxy to vote all new charter class a common stock owned beneficially or of record by liberty interactive following such closing, with certain exceptions. in addition, at the closing of the bright house transaction, a/n and liberty broadband will enter into a proxy agreement pursuant to which a/n will grant to liberty broadband a 5-year irrevocable proxy (which we refer to as the "a/n proxy") to vote, subject to certain exceptions, that number of shares of new charter class a common stock and new charter class b common stock, in each case held by a/n (such shares are referred to as the "proxy shares"), that will result in liberty broadband having voting power in new charter equal to 25.01% of the outstanding voting power of new charter, provided, that the voting power of the proxy shares will be capped at 7.0% of the outstanding voting power of new charter. therefore, giving effect to the liberty interactive proxy and the a/n proxy and the voting cap contained in the bright house/liberty stockholders agreement, liberty broadband is expected to have 25.01% of the outstanding voting power in new charter following the consummation of the twc transaction and bright house transaction. the bright house/liberty stockholders agreement and new charter's amended and restated certificate of incorporation will fix the size of the board at 13 directors, and three designees selected by liberty broadband and two designees selected by a/n will become members of the new charter board of directors. thereafter, liberty broadband will be entitled to designate three nominees to be elected as directors and a/n will be entitled to designate two nominees to be elected as directors, in each case provided that each maintains certain specified voting or equity ownership thresholds and each nominee meets certain applicable requirements or qualifications. liberty broadband and a/n are required to vote (subject to the applicable voting cap) their respective shares of new charter class a common stock and new charter class b common stock for the director nominees nominated by the nominating and corporate governance committee of the board of directors, including the respective designees of liberty broadband and a/n, and against any other nominees, except that, with respect to the unaffiliated directors, liberty broadband and a/n must instead vote in the same proportion as the voting securities are voted by stockholders other than a/n and liberty broadband or any group which includes any of them are voted, if doing so would cause a different outcome with respect to the unaffiliated directors. as a result of their rights under the bright house/liberty stockholders agreement and their significant equity and voting stakes in new charter, liberty broadband and/or a/n, who may have interests different from those of other stockholders, will be able to exercise substantial influence over certain matters relating to the governance of new charter, including the approval of significant corporate actions, such as mergers and other business combination transactions.
the bright house/liberty stockholders agreement will provide a/n and liberty broadband with preemptive rights with respect to issuances of new charter equity in connection with certain transactions, and in the event that a/n or liberty broadband exercises these rights, holders of charter class a common stock may experience further dilution.
the bright house/liberty stockholders agreement provides that a/n and liberty broadband will have certain contractual preemptive rights over issuances of new charter equity securities in connection with capital raising transactions, merger and acquisition transactions, and in certain other circumstances. holders of new charter class a common stock will not be entitled to similar preemptive rights with respect to such transactions. as a result, if liberty broadband and/or a/n elect to exercise their preemptive rights, (i) these parties would not experience the dilution experienced by the other holders of new charter class a common stock, and (ii) such other holders of new charter class a common stock may experience further dilution of their interest in new charter upon such exercise.
completion of the bright house transaction is subject to a number of conditions and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the bright house transaction will not be completed.
the obligation of charter and new charter and the obligation of a/n to complete the bright house transaction is subject to satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including, among others:
•   the consummation of the twc transaction, except in certain circumstances;
•   expiration or termination of the hsr act waiting period and receipt of certain regulatory approvals for the bright house transaction (and with respect to charter's obligations, without the imposition of a bright house contribution burdensome condition);
35
•   obtaining all of the required consents by the fcc to the transfer to charter of all fcc licenses, authorizations, permits and consents held by bright house or its subsidiaries and/or used in the bright house business (solely with respect to charter, new charter and charter holdings, without the imposition of a bright house contribution burdensome);
•   the aggregate number of video customers served by the bright house systems used in the bright house business (i) pursuant to the "grandfathering" provisions of the communications act and (ii) pursuant to franchises for which (a) no consent is required from any government entity for the completion of the bright house contribution or (b) any such consent is required and has been received (or deemed received under section 617 of the communications act) (solely with respect to the obligations of charter, new charter and charter holdings, without the imposition of a bright house contribution burdensome condition) shall not be less than 80% of the video customers served by the bright house systems used in the bright house business at the closing; and if less than 100% of such number of video customers, all applicable waiting periods (including extensions) shall have expired with respect to the fcc forms 394 filed in connection with requests for approvals by local franchising authorities that have not been obtained;
•   obtaining authorizations from state communications authorities as required for charter to provide voice and other regulated services in the bright house systems used in the bright house business following the closing (solely with respect to the obligations of charter, new charter and charter holdings, without the imposition of a bright house contribution burdensome condition);
•   the absence of any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) in effect that makes unlawful, prohibits, delays, enjoins or otherwise prevents or restricts, the consummation of the bright house transaction or any pending action that seeks any of the foregoing;
•   the bright house/liberty stockholders agreement being valid, binding and enforceable and in full force and effect;
•   with respect to the obligations of charter, new charter and charter holdings, the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to bright house;
•   with respect to a/n's obligations, the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to charter; and
•   certain other customary conditions with respect to the accuracy of representations and warranties, performance of covenants and agreements, receipt of certifications with respect to the satisfaction of certain conditions, and delivery of certain other specified certificates, instruments of assignment and transaction documents.
as more fully described in the contribution agreement, the obligation of charter, new charter and charter holdings to complete the bright house transaction is also subject to the completion by a/n of a restructuring, pursuant to which bright house will transfer to a/n certain excluded assets and a/n shall assume from bright house certain excluded liabilities.
there can be no assurance that the conditions to closing of the bright house transaction will be satisfied or waived or that the bright house transaction will be completed. the consummation of the bright house transaction is conditioned on the completion of the twc transaction. however, if the twc transaction is not completed, charter and a/n may still be obligated to complete the bright house transaction under certain circumstances if the tail condition is satisfied. there can be no assurance that the bright house transaction will be completed if the twc transaction is not completed.
risks related to regulatory and legislative matters our business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation, which could adversely affect our business.
regulation of the cable industry has increased cable operators' operational and administrative expenses and limited their revenues. cable operators are subject to various laws and regulations including those covering the following:
•   the provisioning and marketing of cable equipment and compatibility with new digital technologies;
•   customer and employee privacy and data security;
•   limited rate regulation of video service;
•   copyright royalties for retransmitting broadcast signals;
•   when a cable system must carry a particular broadcast station and when it must first obtain retransmission consent to carry a broadcast station;
•   the provision of channel capacity to unaffiliated commercial leased access programmers;
•   limitations on our ability to enter into exclusive agreements with multiple dwelling unit complexes and control our inside wiring;
•   the provision of high-speed internet service, including net neutrality or open internet rules;
•   the provision of voice communications;
•   cable franchise renewals and transfers;
•   equal employment opportunity, emergency alert systems, disability access, technical standards, marketing practices, customer service, and consumer protection; and
36
•   approval for mergers and acquisitions often accompanied by the imposition of restrictions and requirements on an applicant's business in order to secure approval of the proposed transaction.
additionally, many aspects of these laws and regulations are often the subject of judicial proceedings and administrative or legislative proposals. there are also ongoing efforts to amend or expand the federal, state, and local regulation of some of the services offered over our cable systems, which may compound the regulatory risks we already face, and proposals that might make it easier for our employees to unionize. some states are considering adopting energy efficiency regulations governing the operation of equipment (such as broadband modems) that we use to deliver internet services, which could constrain innovation in broadband services and equipment. congress and various federal agencies are also considering legislation and rules that would further regulate us, such as new privacy restrictions and new restrictions on the use of personal and profiling information for behavioral advertising. in response to recent global data breaches, malicious activity and cyber threats, as well as the general increasing concerns regarding the protection of consumers' personal information, congress and various federal agencies are also considering the adoption of new data security and cybersecurity legislation and regulation that could result in additional network and information security requirements for our business. these new laws, as well as existing legal and regulatory obligations, and increased enforcement by the fcc and other agencies, could affect our operations and require significant expenditures. in addition, federal, state, and local regulators could deny necessary approval of the transactions or impose additional regulatory conditions in connection with their review of the transactions that could affect our operations.
changes to existing statutes, rules, regulations, or interpretations thereof, or adoption of new ones, could have an adverse effect on charter's business.
legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules, regulations, or interpretations thereof, or prescribe new ones. any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase charter's costs or impose additional restrictions on charter's businesses. for example, on february 26, 2015, the fcc adopted an order that (1) reclassified broadband internet service as a title ii service, (2) applied certain existing title ii provisions and associated regulations (including requiring that rates and practices be just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory, allowing complaints in court and before the fcc, imposing privacy and disability obligations, and providing broadband providers with access to poles and conduits), (3) forbore from applying a range of other existing title ii provisions and associated regulations, but to varying degrees indicated that this forbearance may be only temporary, and (4) issued new rules expanding disclosure requirements and prohibiting blocking, throttling, paid prioritization, and unreasonable interference with the ability of end users and edge providers to reach each other. the order also subjected broadband providers' internet traffic exchange rates and practices to potential fcc oversight for the first time and created a mechanism for third parties to file complaints regarding these matters. the order has been appealed by multiple parties, but the rules are currently in effect (except for the expanded disclosure requirements, which will not become effective until they receive approval from the office of management and budget). the order could have a material adverse effect on charter's business and results of operations. the fcc is also considering the appropriate regulatory framework for voip service, including whether that service should be regulated under title ii. while charter cannot predict what rules the fcc will adopt as part of these rulemakings, any changes to the regulatory framework for charter's internet or voip services could have a negative impact on its business and results of operations.
the fcc is considering numerous other regulatory changes, including the possibility of new navigation device rules in response to congress' recent elimination of the fcc's "integration ban," which had required cable operators to include a separate security module (i.e., a "cablecard") in all set-top boxes. on january 27, 2016, the fcc chairman announced that he had circulated a notice of proposed rulemaking to the other fcc commissioners for vote on february 18, 2016 and outlined his proposal regarding navigation devices.  if adopted, the chairman's proposal would require us to allow navigation devices on our network if the navigation devices meet standards to be developed by a third party standard setting body envisioned by the proposed rules regardless of the manufacturer of the device.  it remains uncertain what rules, if any, will ultimately be adopted and what operating or financial impact any such rules might have on us including on the security of the content we obtain from programmers that is delivered over any third party navigation device, customer privacy and the user experience. in addition, the fcc's enforcement bureau is actively investigating various industry practices and imposing forfeitures for alleged regulatory violations.
our cable system franchises are subject to non-renewal or termination. the failure to renew a franchise in one or more key markets could adversely affect our business.
our cable systems generally operate pursuant to franchises, permits, and similar authorizations issued by a state or local governmental authority controlling the public rights-of-way. many franchises establish comprehensive facilities and service requirements, as well as specific customer service standards and monetary penalties for non-compliance. in many cases, franchises are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with significant provisions set forth in the franchise agreement governing system operations. franchises are generally granted for fixed terms and must be periodically renewed. franchising authorities may resist granting a renewal if either past performance or the prospective operating proposal is considered inadequate. franchise authorities
37
often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition to renewal. in some instances, local franchises have not been renewed at expiration, and we have operated and are operating under either temporary operating agreements or without a franchise while negotiating renewal terms with the local franchising authorities.
the traditional cable franchising regime has undergone significant change as a result of various federal and state actions. some state franchising laws do not allow incumbent operators like us to opt into favorable statewide franchising as quickly as new entrants, and often require us to retain certain franchise obligations that are more burdensome than those applied to new entrants.
we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all significant provisions of our franchise agreements and certain of our franchisers have from time to time alleged that we have not complied with these agreements. additionally, although historically we have renewed our franchises without incurring significant costs, we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew, or to renew as favorably, our franchises in the future. a termination of or a sustained failure to renew a franchise in one or more key markets could adversely affect our business in the affected geographic area.
our cable system franchises are non-exclusive. accordingly, local and state franchising authorities can grant additional franchises and create additional competition for our products, resulting in overbuilds, which could adversely affect results of operations.
our cable system franchises are non-exclusive. consequently, local and state franchising authorities can grant additional franchises to competitors in the same geographic area or operate their own cable systems. in some cases, local government entities and municipal utilities may legally compete with us on more favorable terms. the fcc recently adopted an order (currently under appeal) rejecting state laws in north carolina and tennessee that restricted municipalities from providing broadband service. in addition, potential competitors (like google) have recently pursued and obtained local franchises that are more favorable than the incumbent operator's franchise. as a result, competing operators may build systems in areas in which we hold franchises.
the fcc has adopted rules that streamline entry for new competitors (particularly those affiliated with telephone companies) and reduce franchising burdens for these new entrants. at the same time, a substantial number of states have adopted new franchising laws, principally designed to streamline entry for new competitors, and often provide advantages for these new entrants that are not immediately available to existing operators. broadband delivery of video content is not necessarily subject to the same franchising obligations applicable to our traditional cable systems.
the fcc administers a program that collects universal service fund contributions from telecommunications service providers and uses them to subsidize the provision of telecommunications services in high-cost areas and to low-income consumers and the provision of internet and telecommunications services to schools, libraries and certain health care providers. a variety of regulatory changes may lead the fcc to expand the collection of universal service fund contributions to encompass internet service providers.
the fcc already has begun to redirect the expenditure of some universal service funding to broadband deployment in ways that could assist competitors in competing with our services.
local franchise authorities have the ability to impose additional regulatory constraints on our business, which could further increase our expenses.
in addition to the franchise agreement, cable authorities in some jurisdictions have adopted cable regulatory ordinances that further regulate the operation of cable systems. this additional regulation increases the cost of operating our business. local franchising authorities may impose new and more restrictive requirements. local franchising authorities who are certified to regulate rates in the communities where they operate generally have the power to reduce rates and order refunds on the rates charged for basic service and equipment.
tax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
we operate cable systems in locations throughout the united states and, as a result, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of federal, state and local governments. from time to time, various legislative and/or administrative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions. there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. certain states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing new or additional taxes or fees on our services or changing the methodologies or base on which certain fees and taxes are computed. the federal internet tax freedom act, which prohibits many taxes on internet access service, will expire october 1, 2016, unless it is renewed by congress. potential changes include additional taxes or fees on our services which could impact our customers, combined reporting and other changes to general business taxes, central/unit-level assessment of property taxes and other matters that could increase our income, franchise, sales, use and/or property tax liabilities. in addition, federal, state and local tax laws and regulations
38
are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.
further regulation of the cable industry could impair our ability to raise rates to cover our increasing costs, resulting in increased losses.
currently, rate regulation of cable systems is strictly limited to the basic service tier and associated equipment and installation activities, and the fcc recently revised its rules, in response to changed market conditions, to make it more difficult for local franchising authorities to assert rate regulation authority. however, the fcc and congress continue to be concerned that cable rate increases are exceeding inflation. it is possible that either the fcc or congress will further restrict the ability of cable system operators to implement rate increases for our video services or even for our high-speed internet and voice services. should this occur, it would impede our ability to raise our rates. if we are unable to raise our rates in response to increasing costs, our losses would increase.
there has been legislative and regulatory interest in requiring companies that own multiple cable networks to make each of them available on a standalone, rather than a bundled basis to cable operators, and in requiring cable operators to offer historically bundled programming services on an á la carte basis to consumers. while any new regulation or legislation designed to enable cable operators to purchase programming on a standalone basis could be beneficial to charter, any regulation or legislation that limits how we sell programming could adversely affect our business.
actions by pole owners might subject us to significantly increased pole attachment costs.
pole attachments are cable wires that are attached to utility poles. cable system attachments to investor-owned public utility poles historically have been regulated at the federal or state level, generally resulting in favorable pole attachment rates for attachments used to provide cable service. in contrast, utility poles owned by municipalities or cooperatives are not subject to federal regulation and are generally exempt from state regulation. future regulatory changes in this area could impact the pole attachment rates we pay utility companies.
changes in channel carriage regulations could impose significant additional costs on us.
cable operators also face significant regulation of their video channel carriage. we can be required to devote substantial capacity to the carriage of programming that we might not carry voluntarily, including certain local broadcast signals; local public, educational and governmental access ("peg") programming; and unaffiliated, commercial leased access programming (required channel capacity for use by persons unaffiliated with the cable operator who desire to distribute programming over a cable system). the fcc adopted revised commercial leased access rules which would dramatically reduce the rate we can charge for leasing this capacity and dramatically increase our administrative burdens, but these remain stayed while under appeal. legislation has been introduced in congress in the past that, if adopted, could impact our carriage of broadcast signals by simultaneously eliminating the cable industry's compulsory copyright license and the retransmission consent requirements governing cable's retransmission of broadcast signals. the fcc also continues to consider changes to the rules affecting the relationship between programmers (including broadcasters) and multichannel video distributors. future regulatory changes could disrupt existing programming commitments, interfere with our preferred use of limited channel capacity, increase our programming costs, and limit our ability to offer services that would maximize our revenue potential. it is possible that other legal restraints will be adopted limiting our discretion over programming decisions.
our voice service is subject to regulatory burdens which may increase, causing us to incur additional costs.
we offer voice communications services over our broadband network using voip services. the fcc has ruled that competitive telephone companies that support voip services, such as those we offer our customers, are entitled to interconnect with incumbent providers of traditional telecommunications services, which ensures that our voip services can compete in the market. the scope of these interconnection rights are being reviewed in a current fcc proceeding, which may affect our ability to compete in the provision of voice services or result in additional costs. the fcc has also declared that certain voip services are not subject to traditional state public utility regulation. the full extent of the fcc preemption of state and local regulation of voip services is not yet clear, and at least one state (minnesota) has asserted jurisdiction over the company's voip services. we have filed a legal challenge to that jurisdictional assertion, which is now pending before a federal district court in minnesota. telecommunications companies generally are subject to other significant regulation which could also be extended to voip providers. if additional telecommunications regulations are applied to our voip service, it could cause us to incur additional costs. the fcc has already extended certain traditional telecommunications carrier requirements to many voip providers such as us, including e911, universal service fund collection, calea, privacy of customer proprietary network information, number porting, network outage reporting,
39
rural call completion reporting, disability access and discontinuance of service requirements. in addition, the fcc is subjecting our voip services to new back-up power obligations that were effective beginning february 2015.
in 2011, the fcc released an order (subsequently upheld on appeal) that significantly changed the rules governing intercarrier compensation payments for the origination and termination of telephone traffic between carriers, including voip service providers like us. this change will result in a substantial decrease in intercarrier compensation payments over a multi-year period.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
reference is made to "part i. item 1a. risk factors" and "cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements," which describe important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and non-historical information contained herein. in addition, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto of charter communications, inc. and subsidiaries included in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
overview we are a cable operator providing services in the united states with approximately 6.7 million residential and small and medium business customers at december 31, 2015. we offer our customers traditional cable video programming, internet services, and voice services, as well as advanced video services such as video on demand, hd television and dvr service. we also sell local advertising on cable networks and provide fiber connectivity to cellular towers and office buildings. see "part i. item 1. business - products and services" for further description of these services, including customer statistics for different services.
our most significant competitors are direct broadcast satellite providers and certain telephone companies that offer services that provide features and functions similar to our internet, video and voice services, including in some cases wireless services, and they also offer these services in bundles similar to ours. customers have been more willing to consider our competitors' products, partially because of continued marketing highlighting perceived differences between competitive video products, especially when those competitors are often offering significant incentives to switch providers. some consumers have chosen to receive video over the internet rather than through pay television services including from us. see "part i. item 1. business - competition."  in the recent past, we have grown revenues by offsetting basic video customer losses with price increases and sales of incremental services such as internet, video on demand, dvr and hd television. we expect to continue to grow revenues by increasing the number of products in our current customer homes, obtaining new customers with our value offering and reducing churn. in addition, we expect to increase revenues by expanding the sales of services to our commercial customers. however, we cannot assure you that we will be able to grow revenues or maintain our margins at recent historical rates.
our business plans include goals for increasing customers and revenue. to reach our goals, we actively invest in our network and operations, and improve the quality and value of the products and packages that we offer. we have enhanced our video product by moving to an all-digital platform, offering more hd channels and increasing digital and hd-dvr penetration. we simplified our offers and pricing, and package our products with the objective of bringing more value to new and existing customers than our competitors. as part of our effort to create more value for customers, we focus on driving penetration of our triple play offering, which includes more than 200 hd channels in most of our markets, video on demand, internet service, and fully-featured voice service. in addition, we have fully insourced our direct sales workforce and are increasingly insourcing our field operations and call center workforces and modifying the way our sales workforce is compensated, which we believe positions us for better customer service and growth. we believe that our enhanced product set combined with improved customer service has lead to lower customer churn and longer customer lifetimes, allowing us to grow our customer base and revenue more quickly and economically.
total revenue growth was 7% for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the corresponding period in 2014, and 12% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the corresponding period in 2013, due to growth in our video, internet and commercial businesses. total revenue growth on a pro forma basis for the acquisition of bresnan as if it had occurred on january 1, 2012 was 8% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the corresponding period in 2013. for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, adjusted ebitda was $3.4 billion, $3.2 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively.  adjusted ebitda is defined as net loss plus net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net, other expense, net and other operating expenses, such as merger and acquisition costs, special charges and (gain) loss on sale or retirement of assets. see "-use of adjusted ebitda and free cash flow" for further information on adjusted ebitda.  adjusted ebitda increased 7% for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the corresponding period in 2014 and 12% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the corresponding period in 2013 as a result of an increase in residential and commercial revenues offset by increases in programming costs, transition costs and other operating costs. adjusted ebitda growth on a pro forma basis for the acquisition of bresnan as if it had occurred on january 1, 2012 was 8% for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the corresponding period in 2013. for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our income from operations was $1.1 billion, $971 million and $909 million, respectively. in addition to the factors discussed above, income from operations was affected by increases in other operating expenses such as merger and acquisition costs as well as increases in depreciation and amortization and stock compensation expense.
46
approximately 91%, 90% and 89% of our revenues for years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, are attributable to monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our video, internet, voice, and commercial services provided by our cable systems. generally, these customer subscriptions may be discontinued by the customer at any time subject to a fee for certain commercial customers. the remaining 9%, 10% and 11% of revenue for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, is derived primarily from advertising revenues, franchise and other regulatory fee revenues (which are collected by us but then paid to local authorities), pay-per-view and video on demand programming, installation, processing fees or reconnection fees charged to customers to commence or reinstate service, and commissions related to the sale of merchandise by home shopping services.
our expenses primarily consist of operating costs, depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense. operating costs primarily include programming costs, connectivity, franchise and other regulatory costs, the costs to service our customers such as field, network and customer operations costs, marketing costs and transition costs related to the twc transaction, bright house transaction and comcast transactions. transition costs represent incremental costs incurred to increase the scale of our business as a result of the twc transaction, bright house transaction and comcast transactions.
we incurred the following transition costs in connection with the twc transaction, bright house transaction and comcast transactions. see "part i. item 1. business" for a discussion regarding the twc transaction, bright house transaction and comcast transactions, years ended december 31,
2015                                      2014                2013
operating expenses             $72                 $14             $-
other operating expenses       $70                 $38             $16
interest expense              $521                 $75             $-
capital expenditures          $115                 $27             $-
in july 2013, charter and charter operating acquired bresnan from a wholly owned subsidiary of cablevision, for $1.625 billion in cash, as well as a working capital adjustment and a reduction for certain funded indebtedness of bresnan (the "bresnan acquisition"). bresnan managed cable operating systems in colorado, montana, wyoming and utah that passed approximately 670,000 homes and served approximately 375,000 residential and commercial customer relationships at the time they were acquired.
we have a history of net losses.  our net losses are principally attributable to insufficient revenue to cover the combination of operating expenses, interest expenses that we incur because of our debt, depreciation expenses resulting from the capital investments we have made and continue to make in our cable properties, amortization expenses related to our customer relationship intangibles and non-cash taxes resulting from increases in our deferred tax liabilities.
critical accounting policies and estimates certain of our accounting policies require our management to make difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments. management has discussed these policies with the audit committee of charter's board of directors, and the audit committee has reviewed the following disclosure. we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the estimates, assumptions and judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements, and the uncertainties that could affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows:
•   property, plant and equipment
•   capitalization of labor and overhead costs
•   valuation and impairment of property, plant and equipment
•   useful lives of property, plant and equipment
•   intangible assets
•   valuation and impairment of franchises
•   valuation and impairment and amortization of customer relationships
•   valuation and impairment of goodwill
•   income taxes
•   litigation
•   programming agreements
47
in addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimates or judgment that are not deemed critical, such as the allowance for doubtful accounts and valuations of our derivative instruments, but changes in estimates or judgment in these other items could also have a material impact on our financial statements.
property, plant and equipment the cable industry is capital intensive, and a large portion of our resources are spent on capital activities associated with extending, rebuilding, and upgrading our cable network. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, the net carrying amount of our property, plant and equipment (consisting primarily of cable network assets) was approximately $8.3 billion (representing 49% of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents) and $8.4 billion (representing 48% of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents), respectively. total capital expenditures for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were approximately $1.8 billion, $2.2 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively.
capitalization of labor and overhead costs. costs associated with network construction, initial customer installations, installation refurbishments, and the installation of equipment necessary to provide video, internet or voices services, are capitalized. while our capitalization is based on specific activities, once capitalized, we track these costs by fixed asset category at the cable system level, and not on a specific asset basis. for assets that are sold or retired, we remove the estimated applicable cost and accumulated depreciation. costs capitalized as part of installations include materials, direct labor, and certain indirect costs. these indirect costs are associated with the activities of personnel who assist in installation activities, and consist of compensation and overhead costs associated with these support functions. the costs of disconnecting service at a customer's dwelling or reconnecting service to a previously installed dwelling are charged to operating expense in the period incurred. costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense as incurred, while plant and equipment replacement, including replacement of certain components, and betterments, including replacement of cable drops from the pole to the dwelling, are capitalized.
we make judgments regarding the installation and construction activities to be capitalized. we capitalize direct labor and overhead using standards developed from actual costs and applicable operational data. we calculate standards annually (or more frequently if circumstances dictate) for items such as the labor rates, overhead rates, and the actual amount of time required to perform a capitalizable activity. for example, the standard amounts of time required to perform capitalizable activities are based on studies of the time required to perform such activities. overhead rates are established based on an analysis of the nature of costs incurred in support of capitalizable activities, and a determination of the portion of costs that is directly attributable to capitalizable activities. the impact of changes that resulted from these studies were not material in the periods presented.
labor costs directly associated with capital projects are capitalized. capitalizable activities performed in connection with installations include such activities as:
•   dispatching a "truck roll" to the customer's dwelling or business for service connection or placement of equipment;
•   verification of serviceability to the customer's dwelling or business (i.e., determining whether the customer's dwelling is capable of receiving service by our cable network and/or receiving advanced or internet services);
•   customer premise activities performed by in-house field technicians and third-party contractors in connection with customer installations, installation of equipment in connection with the installation of video, internet or voice services, and equipment replacement and betterment; and
•   verifying the integrity of the customer's network connection by initiating test signals downstream from the headend to the customer's digital set-top box, as well as testing signal levels at the pole or pedestal.
judgment is required to determine the extent to which overhead costs incurred result from specific capital activities, and therefore should be capitalized. the primary costs that are included in the determination of the overhead rate are (i) employee benefits and payroll taxes associated with capitalized direct labor, (ii) direct variable costs associated with capitalizable activities, consisting primarily of installation and construction vehicle costs, (iii) the cost of support personnel, such as dispatchers, who directly assist with capitalizable installation activities, and (iv) indirect costs directly attributable to capitalizable activities.
while we believe our existing capitalization policies are appropriate, a significant change in the nature or extent of our system activities could affect management's judgment about the extent to which we should capitalize direct labor or overhead in the future. we monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policies, and perform updates to our internal studies on an ongoing basis to determine whether facts or circumstances warrant a change to our capitalization policies. we capitalized internal direct labor and overhead of $286 million, $277 million and $219 million, respectively, for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
valuation and impairment. we evaluate the recoverability of our property, plant and equipment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. such events or changes in circumstances could include such factors as the impairment of our indefinite life franchises, changes in technological advances,
48
fluctuations in the fair value of such assets, adverse changes in relationships with local franchise authorities, adverse changes in market conditions, or a deterioration of current or expected future operating results. a long-lived asset is deemed impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset. no impairments of long-lived assets to be held and used were recorded in the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
we utilize the cost approach as the primary method used to establish fair value for our property, plant and equipment in connection with business combinations.  the cost approach considers the amount required to replace an asset by constructing or purchasing a new asset with similar utility, then adjusts the value in consideration of physical depreciation and functional and economic obsolescence as of the appraisal date. the cost approach relies on management's assumptions regarding current material and labor costs required to rebuild and repurchase significant components of our property, plant and equipment along with assumptions regarding the age and estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment.
useful lives of property, plant and equipment. we evaluate the appropriateness of estimated useful lives assigned to our property, plant and equipment, based on annual analysis of such useful lives, and revise such lives to the extent warranted by changing facts and circumstances. any changes in estimated useful lives as a result of this analysis are reflected prospectively beginning in the period in which the study is completed. our analysis of useful lives in 2015 did not indicate a change in useful lives.  the effect of a one-year decrease in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property, plant and equipment as of december 31, 2015 would be an increase in annual depreciation expense of approximately $251 million.  the effect of a one-year increase in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property, plant and equipment as of december 31, 2015 would be a decrease in annual depreciation expense of approximately $235 million.
depreciation expense related to property, plant and equipment totaled $1.9 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, representing approximately 21%, 22% and 22% of costs and expenses, respectively. depreciation is recorded using the straight-line composite method over management's estimate of the useful lives of the related assets as listed below:
cable distribution systems                      7-20 years customer premise equipment and installations     3-8 years vehicles and equipment                           3-6 years buildings and improvements                     15-40 years furniture, fixtures and equipment               6-10 years intangible assets valuation and impairment of franchises. the net carrying value of franchises as of both december 31, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $6.0 billion (representing 35% of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents). for more information and a complete discussion of how we value and test franchise assets for impairment, see note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
in 2015, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment that indicated the fair value of the franchise assets in each unit of accounting exceeds the carrying value of such assets and thus resulted in no impairment. our units of accounting for franchise impairment testing is based on geographical clustering of our cable systems into groups or markets. for each franchise unit of accounting, the estimated fair value of the franchise assets substantially exceeds the carrying value. based on our qualitative impairment assessment and sensitivity analyses, none of our franchise assets are considered at risk of impairment. based on the qualitative assessment, the franchise assets fair values are more than twice the carrying values for nearly all of the franchise units of accounting. the only exception is a single market in which its fair value of franchise assets exceeds its carrying value by more than 25%. the lower excess fair value of this market when compared to the others is attributed to the recent fair value measurement of this market's franchise assets in purchase accounting.
valuation and impairment of goodwill. the net carrying value of goodwill as of both december 31, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $1.2 billion (representing 7% of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents). for more information and a complete discussion on how we test goodwill for impairment, see note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data." as with our franchise impairment testing, in 2015 we elected to perform a qualitative assessment and concluded that goodwill is not impaired. based on the qualitative assessment and sensitivity analyses, implied goodwill is more than three times its carrying value.

valuation, impairment and amortization of customer relationships. the net carrying value of customer relationships as of december 31, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $856 million (representing 5% of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents) and $1.1 billion (representing 6% of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents), respectively. amortization expense related to customer relationships for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was approximately $249 million, $282 million and $284 million, respectively. no impairment of customer relationships was recorded in the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, or 2013. for more information and a complete discussion on our valuation methodology and amortization method, see note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
income taxes as of december 31, 2015, charter had approximately $11.3 billion of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a gross deferred tax asset of approximately $4.0 billion. federal tax net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2020 through 2035; with $560 million expiring through 2023, $5.7 billion expiring between 2024 and 2028, and $5.0 billion expiring thereafter. these losses resulted from the operations of charter holdco and its subsidiaries. in addition, as of december 31, 2015, charter had state tax net operating loss carryforwards, resulting in a gross deferred tax asset (net of federal tax benefit) of approximately $365 million. state tax net operating loss carryforwards generally expire in the years 2016 through 2035.  such tax loss carryforwards can accumulate and be used to offset charter's future taxable income. as of december 31, 2015, $9.1 billion of federal tax loss carryforwards are unrestricted and available for charter's immediate use, while approximately $2.2 billion of federal tax loss carryforwards are still subject to section 382 and other restrictions. pursuant to these restrictions, charter estimates that approximately $400 million in 2016 and an additional $226 million annually over each of the next eight years of federal tax loss carryforwards, should become unrestricted and available for charter's use. charter's state tax loss carryforwards are subject to similar but varying restrictions.
in addition to its tax loss carryforwards, charter also has tax basis of $4.6 billion in intangible assets and $3.4 billion in property, plant, and equipment as of december 31, 2015. the tax basis in these assets is not subject to section 382 limitations and therefore is currently deductible as depreciated or amortized. for illustrative purposes, charter expects to reflect tax-deductible amortization and depreciation on assets owned as of december 31, 2015, of approximately $1.3 billion in 2016 and $3.2 billion between 2017 through 2020, decelerating annually. the foregoing projected deductions do not include any amortization or depreciation related to future capital spend or potential acquisitions. in addition, the deductions assume charter does not dispose of a material portion of its business, make modifications to the underlying partnerships it owns, or create a new underlying partnership, all of which may materially affect the timing or amount of its existing amortization and depreciation deductions. any one of these factors including pending transactions, future legislation or adjustments by the irs upon examination could also affect the projected deductions.
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. in our evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. due to our history of losses, we were unable to assume future taxable income in our analysis and accordingly valuation allowances have been established against the gross deferred tax assets for book accounting purposes, except for future taxable income that will result from the reversal of existing temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities are recognized. our gross deferred tax assets have been offset with a corresponding valuation allowance of $3.2 billion at december 31, 2015. the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable and, therefore, reflected in the consolidated balance sheet, would be increased at such time that it is more-likely-than-not future taxable income will be realized during the carryforward period. we periodically evaluate the facts and circumstances surrounding this assessment and, at the time this consideration is met, an adjustment to reverse some portion of the existing valuation allowance would result. as of december 31, 2015, we have recorded net deferred income tax liabilities of $1.6 billion largely attributable to the characterization of franchises for financial reporting purposes as indefinite-lived.
in contemplation of the twc transaction, charter has performed a preliminary analysis of the valuation allowance recorded on charter's preexisting deferred tax assets considering the interaction of the tax positions of the acquiring and acquired entities in the twc transaction. based on this analysis, certain of the deferred tax liabilities that are anticipated to be recognized in connection with the close of the twc transaction are expected to reverse and provide a source of future taxable income, resulting in a reduction of substantially all of charter's preexisting valuation allowance associated with its deferred tax assets.  such release of charter's valuation allowance would be recognized directly to income tax benefit on the consolidated statements of operations. this preliminary analysis is subject to the finalization of the acquisition and the full assessment of the facts and circumstances surrounding the possible sources of future taxable income, after the close of the twc transaction.

in determining our tax provision for financial reporting purposes, charter establishes a reserve for uncertain tax positions unless such positions are determined to be "more likely than not" of being sustained upon examination, based on their technical merits. in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our financial statements. the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized when the position is ultimately resolved. there is considerable judgment involved in determining whether positions taken on the tax return are "more likely than not" of being sustained. charter adjusts its uncertain tax reserve estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by, and settlements with, the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations. no tax years for charter or charter holdco, for income tax purposes, are currently under examination by the irs. tax years ending 2012 through 2015 remain subject to examination and assessment. years prior to 2012 remain open solely for purposes of examination of charter's loss and credit carryforwards. we have recorded unrecognized tax benefits totaling approximately $5 million as of december 31, 2015, presented net of deferred taxes. we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31, 2014.
litigation legal contingencies have a high degree of uncertainty. when a loss from a contingency becomes estimable and probable, a reserve is established. the reserve reflects management's best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised as facts and circumstances change. a reserve is released when a matter is ultimately brought to closure or the statute of limitations lapses. we have established reserves for certain matters. although certain matters are not expected individually to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, such matters could have, in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
programming agreements we exercise significant judgment in estimating programming expense associated with certain video programming contracts. our policy is to record video programming costs based on our contractual agreements with our programming vendors, which are generally multi-year agreements that provide for us to make payments to the programming vendors at agreed upon market rates based on the number of customers to which we provide the programming service. if a programming contract expires prior to the parties' entry into a new agreement and we continue to distribute the service, we estimate the programming costs during the period there is no contract in place. in doing so, we consider the previous contractual rates, inflation and the status of the negotiations in determining our estimates. when the programming contract terms are finalized, an adjustment to programming expense is recorded, if necessary, to reflect the terms of the new contract. we also make estimates in the recognition of programming expense related to other items, such as the accounting for free periods, timing of rate increases and credits from service interruptions, as well as the allocation of consideration exchanged between the parties in multiple-element transactions.
significant judgment is also involved when we enter into agreements that result in us receiving cash consideration from the programming vendor, usually in the form of advertising sales, channel positioning fees, launch support or marketing support. in these situations, we must determine based upon facts and circumstances if such cash consideration should be recorded as revenue, a reduction in programming expense or a reduction in another expense category (e.g., marketing).

enterprise psus increased 5,000 and 4,000 in 2015 and 2014, respectively. the increases in enterprise commercial revenues are primarily due to growth in customers.
advertising sales revenues consist primarily of revenues from commercial advertising customers, programmers and other vendors. advertising sales revenues decreased in 2015 primarily as a result of a decrease in political advertising of $29 million. advertising sales revenues increased in 2014 primarily as a result of an increase in political advertising of $30 million. the bresnan acquisition increased advertising sales revenue by approximately $7 million in 2014 compared to the corresponding prior year period.
other revenues consist of home shopping, late payment fees, wire maintenance fees and other miscellaneous revenues. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to an increase in processing fees partially offset by a decrease in wire maintenance fees and the decrease in 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in wire maintenance fees. the bresnan acquisition increased other revenues in 2014 compared to the corresponding prior year period by approximately $2 million.

programming costs were approximately $2.7 billion, $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion, representing 42%, 41% and 40% of operating costs and expenses for each of the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. programming costs consist primarily of costs paid to programmers for basic, digital, premium, video on demand, and pay-per-view programming. the increase in programming costs is primarily a result of annual contractual rate adjustments, including increases in amounts paid for retransmission consents, broader carriage of certain networks as a result of our all-digital initiative and the introduction of new networks to charter's video offering as well as 2014 expense benefits not recurring in 2015. we expect programming expenses to continue to increase due to a variety of factors, including annual increases imposed by programmers with additional selling power as a result of media consolidation, increased demands by owners of broadcast stations for payment for retransmission consent or linking carriage of other services to retransmission consent, and additional programming, particularly new sports services. we have been unable to fully pass these increases on to our customers nor do we expect to be able to do so in the future without a potential loss of customers.
costs to service customers include costs related to field operations, network operations and customer care for our residential and small and medium business customers including internal and third party labor for installations, service and repair, maintenance, billing and collection, occupancy and vehicle costs. the increase in costs to service customers was primarily the result of our larger customer base and higher spending on labor to deliver improved products and service levels and, in 2014, higher collection costs.
the increase in marketing costs during 2014 was the result of heavier sales activity and sales channel development.
transition costs represent incremental costs incurred to increase the scale of our business as a result of the twc transaction, bright house transaction and comcast transactions. the comcast transactions were terminated in april 2015. see "part i. item 1. business" for a discussion regarding the twc transaction, bright house transaction and comcast transactions.
the increases in other expense are attributable to the following (dollars in millions):
2015 compared to 2014            2014 compared to 2013
corporate costs                               $44                              $40

$134                              $90
the increase in corporate costs relates primarily to increases in the number of employees and investments in technology. stock compensation expense increased primarily due to increases in headcount and the value of equity issued. property tax and insurance increased primarily due to the continuation of insourcing our workforce. the increases in bad debt is primarily related to a third quarter 2014 change in our collections policy and lower recoveries.
depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization expense increased by $23 million and $248 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, which primarily represents depreciation on more recent capital expenditures offset by certain assets becoming fully depreciated. the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2014 compared to 2013 was also affected by the bresnan acquisition.

interest expense, net.  net interest expense increased by $395 million in 2015 from 2014 and by $65 million in 2014 from 2013. net interest expense increased in 2015 and 2014 compared to the corresponding prior year periods primarily as a result of an increase of $446 million and $75 million, respectively, of interest expense associated with the debt held in escrow to fund the twc transaction, bright house transaction and comcast transactions offset by a decrease in interest rates.
loss on extinguishment of debt. loss on extinguishment of debt consists of the following for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions):

gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net. interest rate derivative instruments are held to manage our interest costs and reduce our exposure to increases in floating interest rates. we recognized losses of $4 million and $7 million and a gain of $11 million during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which represents the amortization of accumulated other comprehensive loss for interest rate derivative instruments no longer designated as hedges for accounting purposes and their change in fair value. for more information, see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
other expense, net. other expense, net of $7 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily represents equity losses on our equity investments. for more information, see note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
income tax expense. income tax benefit of $60 million and income tax expense of $236 million and $120 million was recognized for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the income tax benefit in 2015 was primarily due to the deemed liquidation of charter holdco solely for federal and state income tax purposes, resulting in a $187 million deferred income tax benefit offset by income tax expense recognized during 2015, primarily through increases in deferred tax liabilities. income tax expense was recognized in all periods primarily through increases in deferred tax liabilities related to charter's franchises, which are characterized as indefinite lived for book financial reporting purposes, as well as to a lesser extent, through current federal and state income tax expense. current federal and state income tax expense included $5 million, $3 million and $8 million, respectively, for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. the tax provision in future periods will vary based on current and future temporary differences, as well as future operating results. for more information, see note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
56
net loss. we incurred net loss of $271 million, $183 million and $169 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily as a result of the factors described above.
loss per common share. during 2015 and 2014, net loss per common share increased by $0.73 and $0.05, respectively, as a result of the factors described above.
use of adjusted ebitda and free cash flow we use certain measures that are not defined by gaap to evaluate various aspects of our business. adjusted ebitda and free cash flow are non-gaap financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net loss and net cash flows from operating activities reported in accordance with gaap. these terms, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. adjusted ebitda and free cash flow are reconciled to net loss and net cash flows from operating activities, respectively, below.
adjusted ebitda is defined as net loss plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, (gain) loss on derivative instruments, net, other expense, net and other operating expenses, such as merger and acquisition costs, special charges and (gain) loss on sale or retirement of assets. as such, it eliminates the significant non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of our businesses as well as other non-cash or special items, and is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. adjusted ebitda is used by management and charter's board of directors to evaluate the performance of our business. however, this measure is limited in that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues and our cash cost of financing. management evaluates these costs through other financial measures.
free cash flow is defined as net cash flows from operating activities, less capital expenditures and changes in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures.
we believe that adjusted ebitda and free cash flow provide information useful to investors in assessing our performance and our ability to service our debt, fund operations and make additional investments with internally generated funds. in addition, adjusted ebitda generally correlates to the leverage ratio calculation under our credit facilities or outstanding notes to determine compliance with the covenants contained in the facilities and notes (all such documents have been previously filed with the united states securities and exchange commission). for the purpose of calculating compliance with leverage covenants, we use adjusted ebitda, as presented, excluding certain expenses paid by our operating subsidiaries to other charter entities. our debt covenants refer to these expenses as management fees, which fees were in the amount of $322 million, $253 million and $201 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

liquidity and capital resources introduction this section contains a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources, including a discussion of our cash position, sources and uses of cash, access to credit facilities and other financing sources, historical financing activities, cash needs, capital expenditures and outstanding debt.
recent events in february 2016, charter's subsidiary, cco holdings, announced an offering of $1.7 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior notes due 2024. we expect to close that offering in february 2016 and the net proceeds will be used to (i) repurchase or redeem certain of cco holdings' 7.000% senior notes due 2019 and 7.375% senior notes due 2020 and pay related fees and expenses and (ii) for general corporate purposes including, for example, to fund a portion of the incremental cash proceeds to twc stockholders if they were to elect $115 per share in cash rather than $100 per share. any redemption or repurchase of notes would not take place until after such cash elections were determined.
overview of our contractual obligations and liquidity we have significant amounts of debt, including $21.8 billion of which proceeds are currently held in escrow pending consummation of the twc transaction.  the principal amount of our debt as of december 31, 2015 was $35.9 billion, consisting of $7.4 billion of credit facility debt and $28.6 billion of senior notes. our business requires significant cash to fund principal and interest payments on our debt.  as of december 31, 2015, $121 million of our long-term debt matures in 2016, $140 million in 2017, $844 million in 2018, $665 million in 2019, $4.2 billion in 2020 and $29.9 billion thereafter. the maturities of the cco safari iii credit facilities assume the twc transaction closes in the second quarter of 2016. as of december 31, 2015, we had other contractual obligations, including interest on our debt, totaling $22.9 billion.
our projected cash needs and projected sources of liquidity depend upon, among other things, our actual results, and the timing and amount of our expenditures. free cash flow was $547 million, $171 million and $409 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. as of december 31, 2015, the amount available under our credit facilities was approximately $961 million. we expect to utilize free cash flow and availability under our credit facilities as well as future refinancing transactions to further extend the maturities of or reduce the principal on our obligations. the timing and terms of any refinancing transactions will be subject to market conditions. additionally, we may, from time to time, depending on market conditions and other factors, use cash on hand and the proceeds from securities offerings or other borrowings, to retire our debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases, tender offers, or redemption provisions. we believe we have sufficient liquidity from cash on hand, free cash flow and charter operating's revolving credit facility as well as access to the capital markets to fund our projected operating cash needs.
we continue to evaluate the deployment of our anticipated future free cash flow including to reduce our leverage, and to invest in our business growth and other strategic opportunities, including mergers and acquisitions as well as stock repurchases and dividends. as possible acquisitions, swaps or dispositions arise in our industry, we actively review them against our objectives including, among other considerations, improving the operational efficiency, clustering or technology capabilities of our business and achieving appropriate return targets, and we may participate to the extent we believe these possibilities present attractive opportunities. however, there can be no assurance that we will actually complete any acquisitions, including the twc transaction and bright house transaction, dispositions or system swaps, or that any such transactions will be material to our operations or results. see "part i. item 1a. risk factors - our inability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses, assets, products or technologies could harm our operating results."

(a)   the table presents maturities of long-term debt outstanding as of december 31, 2015, including $21.8 billion which proceeds are currently held in escrow pending consummation of the twc transaction. the maturities of the cco safari iii credit facilities assume the twc transaction closes in the second quarter of 2016. refer to notes 8 and 18 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" for a description of our long-term debt and other contractual obligations and commitments.
(b)   interest payments on variable debt are estimated using amounts outstanding at december 31, 2015 and the average implied forward london interbank offering rate ("libor") rates applicable for the quarter during the interest rate reset based on the yield curve in effect at december 31, 2015. actual interest payments will differ based on actual libor rates and actual amounts outstanding for applicable periods.
(c)   we lease certain facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating leases. leases and rental costs charged to expense for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, were $49 million, $43 million and $34 million, respectively.
(d)   we pay programming fees under multi-year contracts ranging from three to ten years, typically based on a flat fee per customer, which may be fixed for the term, or may in some cases escalate over the term. programming costs included in the accompanying statement of operations were approximately $2.7 billion, $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion, for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. certain of our programming agreements are based on a flat fee per month or have guaranteed minimum payments. the table sets forth the aggregate guaranteed minimum commitments under our programming contracts.
(e)   "other" represents other guaranteed minimum commitments, which consist primarily of commitments to our customer premise equipment vendors.
the following items are not included in the contractual obligations table because the obligations are not fixed and/or determinable due to various factors discussed below. however, we incur these costs as part of our operations:
•   we rent utility poles used in our operations. generally, pole rentals are cancelable on short notice, but we anticipate that such rentals will recur. rent expense incurred for pole rental attachments for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $53 million, $49 million and $49 million, respectively.
•   we pay franchise fees under multi-year franchise agreements based on a percentage of revenues generated from video service per year. we also pay other franchise related costs, such as public education grants, under multi-year agreements. franchise fees and other franchise-related costs included in the accompanying statement of operations were $212 million, $208 million and $190 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
•   we also have $67 million in letters of credit, primarily to our various worker's compensation, property and casualty, and general liability carriers, as collateral for reimbursement of claims.
charter has agreed to certain commitments that will be effective upon the consummation of the twc transaction and bright house transaction. see "part i. item 1. business" for a listing of these commitments. also, contingent upon closing of the twc transaction and release of the proceeds from escrow, charter will be obligated to pay additional debt issuance fees. for more information, see note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."

limitations on distributions distributions by charter's subsidiaries to a parent company for payment of principal on parent company notes are restricted under indentures and credit facilities governing our indebtedness, unless there is no default under the applicable indenture and credit facilities, and unless each applicable subsidiary's leverage ratio test is met at the time of such distribution. as of december 31, 2015, there was no default under any of these indentures or credit facilities and each subsidiary met its applicable leverage ratio tests based on december 31, 2015 financial results. such distributions would be restricted, however, if any such subsidiary fails to meet these tests at the time of the contemplated distribution. in the past, certain subsidiaries have from time to time failed to meet their leverage ratio test. there can be no assurance that they will satisfy these tests at the time of the contemplated distribution. distributions by charter operating for payment of principal on parent company notes are further restricted by the covenants in its credit facilities.
in addition to the limitation on distributions under the various indentures discussed above, distributions by our subsidiaries may be limited by applicable law, including the delaware limited liability company act, under which our subsidiaries may only make distributions if they have "surplus" as defined in the act.
historical operating, investing, and financing activities cash and cash equivalents. we held $5 million and $3 million in cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. we also held $22.3 billion and $7.1 billion in restricted cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively.
operating activities.  net cash provided by operating activities remained flat at $2.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015 and 2014.
net cash provided by operating activities increased $201 million from $2.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013 to $2.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily due to an increase in adjusted ebitda of $332 million offset by an $87 million increase in cash paid for interest and a $22 million increase in merger and acquisition costs.
investing activities. net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, was $17.0 billion, $9.3 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. the increase in 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to an increase in the investment of net proceeds from the issuance of the cco safari ii notes, cco safari iii credit facilities and ccoh safari notes related to the twc transaction in long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents offset by a decrease in long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents upon repayment of the term g loans and ccoh safari notes out of escrow related to the comcast transactions and a decrease in capital expenditures. the increase in 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily due to the investment of $7.1 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of the term g loans and ccoh safari notes issued in connection with the comcast transactions in long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents, and higher capital expenditures offset by $676 million cash paid for the bresnan acquisition (net of debt assumed) in 2013.
financing activities. net cash provided in financing activities was $14.7 billion, $6.9 billion and $299 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increase in cash provided during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding period in 2014 was primarily the result of the issuance of the cco safari ii notes, cco safari iii credit facilities and ccoh safari notes related to the twc transaction offset by the repayment of $7.1 billion of net proceeds held in escrow related to the ccoh safari notes and term g loans upon the termination of the comcast transactions. the increase in cash provided during the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the corresponding period in 2013, was primarily due to the issuance of the term g loans and ccoh safari notes in 2014 related to the comcast transactions.
capital expenditures we have significant ongoing capital expenditure requirements.  capital expenditures were $1.8 billion, $2.2 billion and $1.8 billion for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  the decrease was driven by the completion of our all-digital transition in 2014 offset by higher product development investments and incremental transition capital expenditures incurred in connection with the twc transaction, bright house transaction and comcast transactions. excluding transition-related expenditures, capital expenditures were $1.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015. see the table below for more details.
we anticipate 2016 capital expenditures to be driven by growth in residential and commercial customers along with further spend related to product development and transition-related expenditures. the actual amount of our capital expenditures in 2016 will
62
depend on a number of factors including the pace of transition planning to service a larger customer base upon closing of the twc transaction and bright house transaction and growth rates of both our residential and commercial businesses.
our capital expenditures are funded primarily from cash flows from operating activities and borrowings on our credit facility. in addition, our liabilities related to capital expenditures increased by $28 million, $33 million and $76 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
the following table presents our major capital expenditures categories in accordance with ncta disclosure guidelines for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. the disclosure is intended to provide more consistency in the reporting of capital expenditures among peer companies in the cable industry. these disclosure guidelines are not required disclosures under gaap, nor do they impact our accounting for capital expenditures under gaap (dollars in millions):

charter operating credit facilities - general the charter operating credit facilities have an outstanding principal amount of $3.6 billion at december 31, 2015 as follows:
•   a term loan a with a remaining principal amount of $647 million, which is repayable in quarterly installments and aggregating $66 million in 2016 and $75 million in 2017, with the remaining balance due at final maturity on april 22, 2018;
•   a term loan e with a remaining principal amount of approximately $1.5 billion, which is repayable in equal quarterly installments and aggregating $15 million in each loan year, with the remaining balance due at final maturity on july 1, 2020;
•   a term loan f with a remaining principal amount of approximately $1.2 billion, which is repayable in equal quarterly installments and aggregating $12 million in each loan year, with the remaining balance due at final maturity on january 3, 2021; and
•   a revolving loan with an outstanding balance of $273 million at december 31, 2015 and allowing for borrowings of up to $1.3 billion, maturing on april 22, 2018.
amounts outstanding under the charter operating credit facilities bear interest, at charter operating's election, at a base rate or libor, as defined, plus a margin. the applicable libor margin for the term loan a is currently 2.00%. the term loans e and f bear interest at libor plus 2.25%, with a libor floor of 0.75%. charter operating pays interest equal to libor plus 2.00% on amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility and pays a revolving commitment fee of 0.30% per annum on the daily average available amount of the revolving commitment, payable quarterly.
the charter operating credit facilities also allow us to enter into incremental term loans in the future, with amortization as set forth in the notices establishing such term loans. although the charter operating credit facilities allow for the incurrence of a certain amount of incremental term loans subject to pro-forma compliance with its financial maintenance covenants, no assurance can be given that we could obtain additional incremental term loans in the future if charter operating sought to do so or what amount of incremental term loans would be allowable at any given time under the terms of the charter operating credit facilities.
the obligations of charter operating under the charter operating credit facilities are guaranteed by charter operating's immediate parent company, cco holdings, and subsidiaries of charter operating. the obligations are also secured by (i) a lien on substantially all of the assets of charter operating and its subsidiaries, to the extent such lien can be perfected under the uniform commercial code by the filing of a financing statement, and (ii) a pledge by cco holdings of the equity interests owned by it in charter operating or any of charter operating's subsidiaries, as well as intercompany obligations owing to it by any of such entities.
cco safari iii credit facilities - general in august 2015, charter operating closed on a new term loan h facility ("term h loan") and a new term loan i facility ("term i loan") totaling an aggregate principal amount of $3.8 billion pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement. the term h loan was issued at a principal amount of $1.0 billion and matures in 2021. pricing on the term h loan was set at libor plus 2.50% with a libor floor of 0.75% and issued at a price of 99.75% of the aggregate principal amount. the term i loan was issued at a principal amount of $2.8 billion and matures in 2023. pricing on the term i loan was set at libor plus 2.75% with a libor floor of 0.75% and issued at a price of 99.75% of the aggregate principal amount. the cco safari iii credit facilities form a portion of the debt financing to be used to fund the cash portion of the twc transaction. charter operating assigned all of its obligations with respect to the cco safari iii credit facilities and transferred all of the proceeds from the cco safari iii credit facilities to cco safari iii, and cco safari iii placed the funds in an escrow account pending the closing of the twc transaction, at which time, subject to certain conditions, charter operating will re-assume the obligations in respect of the cco safari iii credit facilities under the credit agreement. should the twc transaction be terminated, such amounts placed into escrow will be used to settle any outstanding cco safari iii credit facilities at a price of 99.75% of the aggregate principal amount. see "part i. item i. business" for a discussion of the twc transaction and bright house transaction.
charter operating credit facilities - restrictive covenants the charter operating credit facilities contain representations and warranties, and affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type. the financial covenants measure performance against standards set for leverage to be tested as of the end of each quarter. the charter operating credit facilities contain provisions requiring mandatory loan prepayments under specific circumstances, including in connection with certain sales of assets, so long as the proceeds have not been reinvested in the business.
64
additionally, the charter operating credit facilities provisions contain an allowance for restricted payments so long as the consolidated leverage ratio is no greater than 3.5 after giving pro forma effect to such restricted payment. the charter operating credit facilities permit charter operating and its subsidiaries to make distributions to pay interest on the currently outstanding subordinated and parent company indebtedness, provided that, among other things, no default has occurred and is continuing under the charter operating credit facilities.
the events of default under the charter operating credit facilities include, among other things:
•   the failure to make payments when due or within the applicable grace period;
•   the failure to comply with specified covenants including the covenant to maintain the consolidated leverage ratio at or below 5.0 to 1.0 and the consolidated first lien leverage ratio at or below 4.0 to 1.0;
•   the failure to pay or the occurrence of events that cause or permit the acceleration of other indebtedness owing by cco holdings, charter operating, or charter operating's subsidiaries in aggregate principal amounts in excess of $100 million; and
•   similar to provisions contained in the note indentures and credit facility, the consummation of any change of control transaction resulting in any person or group having power, directly or indirectly, to vote more than 50% of the ordinary voting power for the management of charter operating on a fully diluted basis and the occurrence of a ratings event including a downgrade in the corporate family rating during a ratings decline period.
at december 31, 2015, charter operating had a consolidated leverage ratio of approximately 1.1 to 1.0 and a consolidated first lien leverage ratio of 0.9 to 1.0. both ratios are in compliance with the ratios required by the charter operating credit facilities. a failure by charter operating to maintain the financial covenants would result in an event of default under the charter operating credit facilities and the debt of cco holdings. see "- cross acceleration" and "part i. item 1a. risk factors - the agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity."
cco safari iii credit facilities - restrictive covenants the cco safari iii credit facilities are subject to the terms and conditions of a separate credit facility and escrow agreement until charter operating re-assumes its obligations for the loan. the cco safari iii credit facilities contain customary representations and warranties and affirmative covenants with limited negative covenants prohibiting cco safari iii from engaging in any material activities other than performing its obligations under the credit facilities and the escrow agreement or otherwise issuing other indebtedness pursuant to escrow arrangements similar to the cco safari iii credit facilities and escrow agreement. as required by the cco safari iii credit facilities, cco safari iii, bank of america, n.a., and u.s. bank, n.a., as escrow agent, entered into an escrow agreement pursuant to which, cco safari iii is required to maintain an escrow account over which the administrative agent has a perfected first priority security interest on behalf of the cco safari iii credit facilities lenders. the events of default under the cco safari iii credit facilities include, among others:
•   the failure to make payments when due or within the applicable grace period;
•   any acceleration of the loans and termination of the commitments under the charter operating credit facilities; and
•   the escrow agreement shall cease to be in full force and effect or the lien in the escrow account shall cease to be enforceable with the same effect and priority.

summary of restrictive covenants of our note indentures the following description is a summary of certain restrictions of our note indentures. the summary does not restate the terms of the note indentures in their entirety, nor does it describe all restrictions. the agreements and instruments governing each of the notes issued are complicated and you should consult such agreements and instruments for more detailed information regarding the notes issued.
the ccoh safari notes were issued pursuant to a base indenture and a first supplemental indenture to that base all dated november 20, 2015 (the "ccoh safari indentures"). the ccoh safari indentures provide that, with limited exceptions of covenants regarding compliance certificates and stay, extension and usury laws, covenants restricting the activities of the note issuer and its subsidiaries do not apply until such time as the ccoh safari note proceeds are released from escrow. as stated previously, substantially concurrently with the escrow release, the ccoh safari notes will become obligations of cco holdings and cco holdings capital, ccoh safari will merge with cco holdings and the terms and conditions of the ccoh safari indentures will apply to cco holdings and cco holdings capital.
the notes issued by cco holdings and cco holdings capital were issued pursuant to certain indentures referred to in this section as the "cco holdings indentures." the cco holdings indentures and the ccoh safari indentures (following the release of proceeds from escrow) contain covenants that restrict the ability of cco holdings and its subsidiaries to, among other things:
•   incur indebtedness;
•   pay dividends or make distributions in respect of capital stock and other restricted payments;
•   issue equity;
•   make investments;
•   create liens;
•   sell assets;
•   consolidate, merge, or sell all or substantially all assets;
•   create restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make certain payments; or
•   enter into transactions with affiliates.
however, such covenants are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions. below we set forth a brief summary of certain of the restrictive covenants.
restrictions on additional debt the limitations on incurrence of debt and issuance of preferred stock contained in the cco holdings indentures and the ccoh safari indentures permit cco holdings and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional debt or issue preferred stock, so long as, after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence, the leverage ratio would be below a specified level for cco holdings. the leverage ratio under the indentures is 6.0 to 1.
in addition, regardless of whether the leverage ratio could be met, so long as no default exists or would result from the incurrence or issuance, cco holdings and its restricted subsidiaries are permitted to issue among other permitted indebtedness:
•   up to $1.5 billion of debt under credit facilities not otherwise allocated;
68
•   up to the greater of $300 million (or $600 million in the case of the notes issued under the ccoh safari indentures)
and 5% of consolidated net tangible assets to finance the purchase or capital lease of new assets;
•   up to the greater of $300 million (or $600 million in the case of the notes issued under the ccoh safari indentures)
and 5% of consolidated net tangible assets of additional debt for any purpose; and
•   other items of indebtedness for specific purposes such as intercompany debt, refinancing of existing debt, and interest rate swaps to provide protection against fluctuation in interest rates.
indebtedness under a single facility or agreement may be incurred in part under one of the categories listed above and in part under another, and generally may also later be reclassified into another category including as debt incurred under the leverage ratio. accordingly, indebtedness under our credit facilities may be incurred under a combination of the categories of permitted indebtedness listed above. the restricted subsidiaries of cco holdings are generally not permitted to issue subordinated debt securities.
restrictions on distributions generally, under the indentures governing notes issued by cco holdings and ccoh safari, cco holdings and its respective restricted subsidiaries are permitted to pay dividends on or repurchase equity interests, or make other specified restricted payments, only if it can incur $1.00 of new debt under the 6.0 to 1.0 leverage ratio test after giving effect to the transaction and if no default exists or would exist as a consequence of such incurrence. if those conditions are met, restricted payments may be made in a total amount of up to the sum of 100% of cco holdings' consolidated ebitda, as defined, minus 1.3 times its consolidated interest expense, as defined, cumulatively from april 1, 2010, plus 100% of new cash and appraised non-cash equity proceeds received by cco holdings and not allocated to certain investments, cumulatively from the issue date, plus $2 billion.
in addition, cco holdings may make distributions or restricted payments, so long as no default exists or would be caused by transactions among other distributions or restricted payments:
•   to repurchase management equity interests in amounts not to exceed $10 million per fiscal year (or $50 million per fiscal year in the case of notes issued under the ccoh safari indentures);
•   to pay pass-through tax liabilities in respect of ownership of equity interests in the applicable issuer or its restricted subsidiaries; or
•   to make other specified restricted payments including merger fees up to 1.25% of the transaction value, repurchases using concurrent new issuances, and certain dividends on existing subsidiary preferred equity interests.
restrictions on investments cco holdings and its respective restricted subsidiaries may not make investments except (i) permitted investments or (ii) if, after giving effect to the transaction, their leverage would be above the applicable leverage ratio.
permitted investments include, among others:
•   investments in and generally among restricted subsidiaries or by restricted subsidiaries in the applicable issuer;
•   investments aggregating up to $750 million (or $1.1 billion in the case of notes issued under cco holdings indentures for the year 2011 through the date of this filing and for notes issued under the ccoh safari indentures) at any time outstanding; and
•   investments aggregating up to 100% of new cash equity proceeds received by cco holdings since the issue date to the extent the proceeds have not been allocated to the restricted payments covenant.
restrictions on liens the restrictions on liens for cco holdings only apply to liens on assets of the issuer itself and do not restrict liens on assets of cco holdings' subsidiaries. permitted liens include liens securing indebtedness and other obligations under credit facilities, liens securing the purchase price of financed new assets, liens securing indebtedness of up to the greater of $50 million (or $90 million in the case of notes issued under the ccoh safari indentures) and 1.0% of consolidated net tangible assets and other specified liens.

restrictions on the sale of assets; mergers cco holdings is generally not permitted to sell all or substantially all of its assets or merge with or into other companies unless its leverage ratio after any such transaction would be no greater than its leverage ratio immediately prior to the transaction, or unless after giving effect to the transaction, leverage would be below 6.0 to 1.0, no default exists, and the surviving entity is a u.s. entity that assumes the applicable notes.
cco holdings and its restricted subsidiaries may generally not otherwise sell assets or, in the case of restricted subsidiaries, issue equity interests, in excess of $100 million unless they receive consideration at least equal to the fair market value of the assets or equity interests, consisting of at least 75% in cash, assumption of liabilities, securities converted into cash within 60 days, or productive assets. cco holdings and its restricted subsidiaries are then required within 365 days after any asset sale either to use or commit to use the net cash proceeds over a specified threshold to acquire assets used or useful in their businesses or use the net cash proceeds to repay specified debt, or to offer to repurchase the issuer's notes with any remaining proceeds.
prohibitions on restricting dividends cco holdings' restricted subsidiaries may generally not enter into arrangements involving restrictions on their ability to make dividends or distributions or transfer assets to cco holdings unless those restrictions with respect to financing arrangements are on terms that are no more restrictive than those governing the credit facilities existing when they entered into the applicable indentures or are not materially more restrictive than customary terms in comparable financings and will not materially impair cco holdings' ability to make payments on the notes.
affiliate transactions the cco holdings indentures and ccoh safari indentures also restrict the ability of cco holdings and its restricted subsidiaries to enter into certain transactions with affiliates involving consideration in excess of $25 million without a determination by the board of directors that the transaction complies with this covenant, or transactions with affiliates involving over $100 million without receiving an opinion as to the fairness to the holders of such transaction from a financial point of view issued by an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of national standing.
cross acceleration the cco holdings indentures and ccoh safari indentures include various events of default, including cross acceleration provisions. under these provisions, a failure by cco holdings or any of its restricted subsidiaries to pay at the final maturity thereof the principal amount of other indebtedness having a principal amount of $100 million or more (or any other default under any such indebtedness resulting in its acceleration) would result in an event of default under the indenture governing the applicable notes. as a result, an event of default related to the failure to repay principal at maturity or the acceleration of the indebtedness under the notes issued under the cco holdings indentures or the ccoh safari indentures or the charter operating or cco safari iii credit facilities could cause cross-defaults under all outstanding indentures.

item 1a. risk factors you should consider carefully the following risks, along with the other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this form 10-k. additional risks and uncertainties also may adversely affect our business and operations including those discussed in item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form 10-k. if any of the following events actually occur, our business, financial results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
we routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different, sometimes materially different, than we presently anticipate. the categories of risk we have identified in item 1a.-risk factors of this form 10-k include the following:
•   risks related to our high level of indebtedness;
•   risks associated with our ability to raise needed capital;
•   external risks associated with revenue and earnings volatility;
•   risks associated with our operations; and
•   risks associated with governmental regulation and laws.
these risk factors should be read in conjunction with item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.
risks related to our high level of indebtedness we have a significant amount of debt, a large percentage of which is secured, which could adversely affect our business and the ability to fulfill our obligations.
as of december 31, 2015, we had approximately $20.8 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis. all outstanding borrowings under the aes corporation's senior secured credit facility are secured by certain of our assets, including the pledge of capital stock of many of the aes corporation's directly held subsidiaries. most of the debt of the aes corporation's subsidiaries is secured by substantially all of the assets of those subsidiaries. since we have such a high level of debt, a substantial portion of cash flow from operations must be used to make payments on this debt. furthermore, since a significant percentage of our assets are used to secure this debt, this reduces the amount of collateral that is available for future secured debt or credit support and reduces our flexibility in dealing with these secured assets. this high level of indebtedness and related security could have other important consequences to us and our investors, including:
•   making it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations at the holding company and/or individual subsidiaries;
•   increasing the likelihood of a downgrade of our debt, which could cause future debt costs and/or payments to increase under our debt and related hedging instruments and consume an even greater portion of cash flow;
•   increasing our vulnerability to general adverse industry and economic conditions, including but not limited to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices;
•   reducing the availability of cash flow to fund other corporate purposes and grow our business;
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;
•   placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged; and
•   limiting, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants relating to such indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock.
the agreements governing our indebtedness, including the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, limit, but do not prohibit the incurrence of additional indebtedness. to the extent we become more leveraged, the risks described above would increase. further, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. accordingly, our cash flows may not be sufficient to repay at maturity all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due and, in that event, we may not be able to borrow
55
money, sell assets, raise equity or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to refinance our debt as it becomes due. see note 12-debt included in item 8. of this form 10-k for a schedule of our debt maturities.
the aes corporation is a holding company and its ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness, including its public debt securities, is dependent upon the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries by way of dividends, fees, interest, loans or otherwise.
the aes corporation is a holding company with no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. all of the aes corporation's revenue is generated through its subsidiaries. accordingly, almost all of the aes corporation's cash flow is generated by the operating activities of its subsidiaries. therefore, the aes corporation's ability to make payments on its indebtedness and to fund its other obligations is dependent not only on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate cash, but also on the ability of the subsidiaries to distribute cash to it in the form of dividends, fees, interest, tax sharing payments, loans or otherwise.
however, our subsidiaries face various restrictions in their ability to distribute cash to the aes corporation. most of the subsidiaries are obligated, pursuant to loan agreements, indentures or non-recourse financing arrangements, to satisfy certain restricted payment covenants or other conditions before they may make distributions to the aes corporation. in addition, the payment of dividends or the making of loans, advances or other payments to the aes corporation may be subject to other contractual, legal or regulatory restrictions or may be prohibited altogether. business performance and local accounting and tax rules may limit the amount of retained earnings that may be distributed to us as a dividend. subsidiaries in foreign countries may also be prevented from distributing funds to the aes corporation as a result of foreign governments restricting the repatriation of funds or the conversion of currencies. any right that the aes corporation has to receive any assets of any of its subsidiaries upon any liquidation, dissolution, winding up, receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings (and the consequent right of the holders of the aes corporation's indebtedness to participate in the distribution of, or to realize proceeds from, those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of any such subsidiary's creditors (including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by such subsidiary).
the aes corporation's subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and, unless they have expressly guaranteed any of the aes corporation's indebtedness, have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to such debt or to make any funds available whether by dividends, fees, loans or other payments.
even though the aes corporation is a holding company, existing and potential future defaults by subsidiaries or affiliates could adversely affect the aes corporation.
we attempt to finance our domestic and foreign projects primarily under loan agreements and related documents which, except as noted below, require the loans to be repaid solely from the project's revenues and provide that the repayment of the loans (and interest thereon) is secured solely by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts and cash flow of that project subsidiary or affiliate. this type of financing is usually referred to as non-recourse debt or "non-recourse financing." in some non-recourse financings, the aes corporation has explicitly agreed to undertake certain limited obligations and contingent liabilities, most of which by their terms will only be effective or will be terminated upon the occurrence of future events. these obligations and liabilities take the form of guarantees, indemnities, letter of credit reimbursement agreements and agreements to pay, in certain circumstances, the project lenders or other parties.
as of december 31, 2015, we had approximately $20.8 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, of which approximately $5.0 billion was recourse debt of the aes corporation and approximately $15.8 billion was non-recourse debt. in addition, we have outstanding guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, and other credit support commitments which are further described in this form 10-k in item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-capital resources and liquidity-parent company liquidity.
some of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. the total debt classified as current in our consolidated balance sheets related to such defaults was $1.0 billion as of december 31, 2015. while the lenders under our non-recourse financings generally do not have direct recourse to the aes corporation (other than to the extent of any credit support given by the aes corporation), defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for the aes corporation, including, without limitation:
•   reducing the aes corporation's receipt of subsidiary dividends, fees, interest payments, loans and other sources of cash since the project subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the aes corporation during the pendency of any default;
•   under certain circumstances, triggering the aes corporation's obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support which the aes corporation has provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary;
•   causing the aes corporation to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets;
56
•   triggering defaults in the aes corporation's outstanding debt and trust preferred securities. for example, the aes corporation's senior secured credit facility and outstanding senior notes include events of default for certain bankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries. in addition, the aes corporation's senior secured credit facility includes certain events of default relating to accelerations of outstanding material debt of material subsidiaries or any subsidiaries that in the aggregate constitute a material subsidiary;
•   the loss or impairment of investor confidence in the company; or
•   foreclosure on the assets that are pledged under the non-recourse loans, therefore eliminating any and all potential future benefits derived from those assets.
none of the projects that are currently in default are owned by subsidiaries that individually or in the aggregate meet the applicable standard of materiality in the aes corporation's senior secured credit facility or other debt agreements in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under such indebtedness. however, as a result of future mix of distributions, write-down of assets, dispositions and other matters that affect our financial position and results of operations, it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries, individually or in the aggregate, could fall within the applicable standard of materiality and thereby upon an acceleration of such subsidiary's debt, trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under the aes corporation's senior secured credit facility or other indebtedness of the aes corporation.
risks associated with our ability to raise needed capital the aes corporation, or the parent company, has significant cash requirements and limited sources of liquidity.
the aes corporation requires cash primarily to fund:
•   principal repayments of debt;
•   interest and preferred dividends;
•   acquisitions;
•   construction and other project commitments;
•   other equity commitments, including business development investments;
•   equity repurchases and/or cash dividends on our common stock;
•   taxes; and
•   parent company overhead costs.
the aes corporation's principal sources of liquidity are:
•   dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries;
•   proceeds from debt and equity financings at the parent company level; and
•   proceeds from asset sales.
for a more detailed discussion of the aes corporation's cash requirements and sources of liquidity, please see item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-capital resources and liquidity in this form 10-k.
while we believe that these sources will be adequate to meet our obligations at the parent company level for the foreseeable future, this belief is based on a number of material assumptions, including, without limitation, assumptions about our ability to access the capital or commercial lending markets, the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, exchange rates, our ability to sell assets, and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. any number of assumptions could prove to be incorrect, and, therefore there can be no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than expected. for example, in recent years, certain financial institutions have gone bankrupt. in the event that a bank who is party to our senior secured credit facility or other facilities goes bankrupt or is otherwise unable to fund its commitments, we would need to replace that bank in our syndicate or risk a reduction in the size of the facility, which would reduce our liquidity. in addition, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay at maturity the entire principal outstanding under our credit facility and our debt securities and we may have to refinance such obligations. there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all and any of these events could have a material effect on us.
our ability to grow our business could be materially adversely affected if we were unable to raise capital on favorable terms.
from time to time, we rely on access to capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows. our ability to arrange for financing on either a recourse or non-recourse basis and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:
57
•   general economic and capital market conditions;
•   the availability of bank credit;
•   investor confidence;
•   the financial condition, performance and prospects of the aes corporation in general and/or that of any subsidiary requiring the financing as well as companies in our industry or similar financial circumstances; and
•   changes in tax and securities laws which are conducive to raising capital.
should future access to capital not be available to us, we may have to sell assets or decide not to build new plants or expand or improve existing facilities, either of which would affect our future growth, results of operations or financial condition.
a downgrade in the credit ratings of the aes corporation or its subsidiaries could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets which could increase our interest costs or adversely affect our liquidity and cash flow.
if any of the credit ratings of the aes corporation or its subsidiaries were to be downgraded, our ability to raise capital on favorable terms could be impaired and our borrowing costs could increase. furthermore, depending on the aes corporation's credit ratings and the trading prices of its equity and debt securities, counterparties may no longer be as willing to accept general unsecured commitments by the aes corporation to provide credit support. accordingly, with respect to both new and existing commitments, the aes corporation may be required to provide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of credit and/or collateral, to backstop or replace any credit support by the aes corporation. there can be no assurance that such counterparties will accept such guarantees or that aes could arrange such further assurances in the future. in addition, to the extent the aes corporation is required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such counterparties, it will limit the amount of credit available to the aes corporation to meet its other liquidity needs.
we may not be able to raise sufficient capital to fund developing projects in certain less developed economies which could change or in some cases adversely affect our growth strategy.
part of our strategy is to grow our business by developing businesses in less developed economies where the return on our investment may be greater than projects in more developed economies. commercial lending institutions sometimes refuse to provide non-recourse project financing in certain less developed economies, and in these situations we have sought and will continue to seek direct or indirect (through credit support or guarantees) project financing from a limited number of multilateral or bilateral international financial institutions or agencies. as a precondition to making such project financing available, the lending institutions may also require governmental guarantees of certain project and sovereign related risks. there can be no assurance, however, that project financing from the international financial agencies or that governmental guarantees will be available when needed, and if they are not, we may have to abandon the project or invest more of our own funds which may not be in line with our investment objectives and would leave less funds for other projects.
external risks associated with revenue and earnings volatility our businesses may incur substantial costs and liabilities and be exposed to price volatility as a result of risks associated with the wholesale electricity markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.
some of our businesses sell electricity in the spot markets in cases where they operate at levels in excess of their power sales agreements or retail load obligations. our businesses may also buy electricity in the wholesale spot markets. as a result, we are exposed to the risks of rising and falling prices in those markets. the open market wholesale prices for electricity can be volatile and often reflect the fluctuating cost of fuels such as coal, natural gas or oil derivative fuels in addition to other factors described below. consequently, any changes in the supply and cost of coal, natural gas, or oil derivative fuels may impact the open market wholesale price of electricity.
volatility in market prices for fuel and electricity may result from among other things:
•   plant availability in the markets generally;
•   availability and effectiveness of transmission facilities owned and operated by third parties;
•   competition;
•   electricity usage;
•   seasonality;
•   foreign exchange rate fluctuation;
•   availability and price of emission credits;
•   hydrology and other weather conditions;
•   illiquid markets;
•   transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies;
58
•   availability of competitively priced renewables sources;
•   increased adoption of distributed generation;
•   available supplies of natural gas, crude oil and refined products, and coal;
•   generating unit performance;
•   natural disasters, terrorism, wars, embargoes, and other catastrophic events;
•   energy, market and environmental regulation, legislation and policies;
•   geopolitical concerns affecting global supply of oil and natural gas;
•   general economic conditions in areas where we operate which impact energy consumption; and
•   bidding behavior and market bidding rules.
our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates experienced at our foreign operations.
our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entity's functional currency. while the consolidated financial statements are reported in u.s. dollars, the financial statements of many of our subsidiaries outside the u.s. are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into u.s. dollars by applying appropriate exchange rates. as a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar relative to the local currencies where our subsidiaries outside the u.s. report could cause significant fluctuations in our results. in addition, while our expenses with respect to foreign operations are generally denominated in the same currency as corresponding sales, we have transaction exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in the subsidiary's functional currency. moreover, the costs of doing business abroad may increase as a result of adverse exchange rate fluctuations. our financial position and results of operations could be affected by fluctuations in the value of a number of currencies. see item 7a.-quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk to this form 10-k for further information.
we may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates.
we routinely enter into contracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sale commitments for electricity, fuel requirements and other commodities to lower our financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations. as part of this strategy, we routinely utilize fixed price or indexed forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. we also enter into contracts which help us manage our interest rate exposure. however, we may not cover the entire exposure of our assets or positions to market price or interest rate volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. furthermore, the risk management practices we have in place may not always perform as planned. in particular, if prices of commodities or interest rates significantly deviate from historical prices or interest rates or if the price or interest rate volatility or distribution of these changes deviates from historical norms, our risk management practices may not protect us from significant losses. as a result, fluctuating commodity prices or interest rates may negatively impact our financial results to the extent we have unhedged or inadequately hedged positions. in addition, certain types of economic hedging activities may not qualify for hedge accounting under u.s. gaap, resulting in increased volatility in our net income. the company may also suffer losses associated with "basis risk" which is the difference in performance between the hedge instrument and the targeted underlying exposure. furthermore, there is a risk that the current counterparties to these arrangements may fail or are unable to perform part or all of their obligations under these arrangements.
our coal-fired facilities in the us continue to face substantial challenges as a result of high coal prices relative to natural gas, particularly those which are merchant plants that are exposed to market risk and those that have hybrid merchant risk, meaning those businesses that have a ppa in place but purchase fuel at market prices or under short term contracts. for our businesses with ppa pricing that does not perfectly pass through our fuel costs, the businesses attempt to manage the exposure through flexible fuel purchasing and timing of entry and terms of our fuel supply agreements; however, these risk management efforts may not be successful and the resulting commodity exposure could have a material impact on these businesses and/or our results of operations.
supplier and/or customer concentration may expose the company to significant financial credit or performance risks.
we often rely on a single contracted supplier or a small number of suppliers for the provision of fuel, transportation of fuel and other services required for the operation of certain of our facilities. if these suppliers cannot perform, we would seek to meet our fuel requirements by purchasing fuel at market prices, exposing us to market price volatility and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available during certain periods at any price, which could adversely impact the profitability of the affected business and our results of operations, and could result in a breach of agreements with other counterparties, including, without limitation, offtakers or lenders.
59
at times, we rely on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facility's output, in some cases under long-term agreements that account for a substantial percentage of the anticipated revenue from a given facility. we have also hedged a portion of our exposure to power price fluctuations through forward fixed price power sales. counterparties to these agreements may breach or may be unable to perform their obligations. we may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on terms as favorable as our existing agreements, or at all. if we were unable to enter into replacement ppas, these businesses may have to sell power at market prices. a breach by a counterparty of a ppa or other agreement could also result in the breach of other agreements, including, without limitation, the debt documents of the affected business.
the failure of any supplier or customer to fulfill its contractual obligations to the aes corporation or our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. consequently, the financial performance of our facilities is dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance by, suppliers and customers.
the market pricing of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in future periods.
the market price for our common stock has been volatile in the past, and the price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future. stock price movements on a quarter-by-quarter basis for the past two years are presented in item 5.-market-market information of this form 10-k. factors that could affect the price of our common stock in the future include general conditions in our industry, in the power markets in which we participate and in the world, including environmental and economic developments, over which we have no control, as well as developments specific to us, including, risks that could result in revenue and earnings volatility as well as other risk factors described in item 1a.-risk factors and those matters described in item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations.
risks associated with our operations we do a significant amount of business outside the united states, including in developing countries, which presents significant risks.
a significant amount of our revenue is generated outside the united states and a significant portion of our international operations is conducted in developing countries. part of our growth strategy is to expand our business in certain developing countries in which aes has an existing presence as such countries may have higher growth rates and offer greater opportunities to expand from our platforms, with potentially higher returns than in some more developed countries. international operations, particularly the operation, financing and development of projects in developing countries, entail significant risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:
•   economic, social and political instability in any particular country or region;
•   adverse changes in currency exchange rates;
•   government restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds;
•   unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations or in trade, monetary or fiscal policies;
•   high inflation and monetary fluctuations;
•   restrictions on imports of coal, oil, gas or other raw materials required by our generation businesses to operate;
•   threatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments;
•   risks relating to the failure to comply with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, united kingdom bribery act or other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations;
•   difficulties in hiring, training and retaining qualified personnel, particularly finance and accounting personnel with gaap expertise;
•   unwillingness of governments and their agencies, similar organizations or other counterparties to honor their contracts;
•   unwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are economically advantageous to subsidiaries of the company and economically unfavorable to counterparties, against such counterparties, whether such counterparties are governments or private parties;
•   inability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative and legal systems;
•   adverse changes in government tax policy;
•   difficulties in enforcing our contractual rights or enforcing judgments or obtaining a favorable result in local jurisdictions; and
•   potentially adverse tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions.
any of these factors, by itself or in combination with others, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. our operations may experience volatility in revenues and operating margin which have caused and are expected to cause significant volatility in our results of operations and cash flows. the volatility is caused by regulatory and economic difficulties, political instability and currency devaluations being experienced in many of these
60
countries. this volatility reduces the predictability and enhances the uncertainty associated with cash flows from these businesses. a number of our businesses are facing challenges associated with regulatory changes.
the operation of power generation, distribution and transmission facilities involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial results. we and/or our subsidiaries may not have adequate risk mitigation and/or insurance coverage for liabilities.
we are in the business of generating and distributing electricity, which involves certain risks that can adversely affect financial and operating performance, including:
•   changes in the availability of our generation facilities or distribution systems due to increases in scheduled and unscheduled plant outages, equipment failure, failure of transmission systems, labor disputes, disruptions in fuel supply, poor hydrologic and wind conditions, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements or catastrophic events such as fires, floods, storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, dam failures, explosions, terrorist acts, cyber attacks or other similar occurrences; and
•   changes in our operating cost structure including, but not limited to, increases in costs relating to gas, coal, oil and other fuel; fuel transportation; purchased electricity; operations, maintenance and repair; environmental compliance, including the cost of purchasing emissions offsets and capital expenditures to install environmental emission equipment; transmission access; and insurance.
our businesses require reliable transportation sources (including related infrastructure such as roads, ports and rail), power sources and water sources to access and conduct operations. the availability and cost of this infrastructure affects capital and operating costs and levels of production and sales. limitations, or interruptions in this infrastructure or at the facilities of our subsidiaries, including as a result of third parties intentionally or unintentionally disrupting this infrastructure or the facilities of our subsidiaries, could impede their ability to produce electricity. this could have a material adverse effect on our businesses' results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
in addition, a portion of our generation facilities were constructed many years ago. older generating equipment may require significant capital expenditures for maintenance. the equipment at our plants, whether old or new, is also likely to require periodic upgrading, improvement or repair, and replacement equipment or parts may be difficult to obtain in circumstances where we rely on a single supplier or a small number of suppliers. the inability to obtain replacement equipment or parts may impact the ability of our plants to perform and could, therefore, have a material impact on our business and results of operations. breakdown or failure of one of our operating facilities may prevent the facility from performing under applicable power sales agreements which, in certain situations, could result in termination of a power purchase or other agreement or incurrence of a liability for liquidated damages and/or other penalties.
as a result of the above risks and other potential hazards associated with the power generation, distribution and transmission industries, we may from time to time become exposed to significant liabilities for which we may not have adequate risk mitigation and/or insurance coverage. power generation involves hazardous activities, including acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems. in addition to natural risks, such as earthquakes, floods, lightning, hurricanes and wind, hazards, such as fire, explosion, collapse and machinery failure, are inherent risks in our operations which may occur as a result of inadequate internal processes, technological flaws, human error or actions of third parties or other external events. the control and management of these risks depend upon adequate development and training of personnel and on the existence of operational procedures, preventative maintenance plans and specific programs supported by quality control systems which reduce, but do not eliminate, the possibility of the occurrence and impact of these risks.
the hazards described above, along with other safety hazards associated with our operations, can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. the occurrence of any one of these events may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and fines and/or penalties. we maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe is customary, but there can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. a claim for which we are not fully insured or insured at all could hurt our financial results and materially harm our financial condition. further, due to the cyclical nature of the insurance markets, we cannot provide assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available on terms similar to those presently available to us or at all. any losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
our businesses' insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with its operations. adequate coverage at reasonable rates is not always obtainable. in addition, insurance may not fully cover the liability or the consequences of any business interruptions such as equipment failure or labor dispute. the occurrence of a significant adverse event not fully or partially covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results or operations, financial condition and prospects.
61
any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
our inability to attract and retain skilled people could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
our operating success and ability to carry out growth initiatives depends in part on our ability to retain executives and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel who have experience in our industry and in operating a company of our size and complexity, including people in our foreign businesses. the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, because of the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacements. for example, we routinely are required to assess the financial impacts of complicated business transactions which occur on a worldwide basis. these assessments are dependent on hiring personnel on a worldwide basis with sufficient expertise in u.s. gaap to timely and accurately comply with u.s. reporting obligations. an inability to maintain adequate internal accounting and managerial controls and hire and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our financial and tax reporting.
we have contractual obligations to certain customers to provide full requirements service, which makes it difficult to predict and plan for load requirements and may result in increased operating costs to certain of our businesses.
we have contractual obligations to certain customers to supply power to satisfy all or a portion of their energy requirements. the uncertainty regarding the amount of power that our power generation and distribution facilities must be prepared to supply to customers may increase our operating costs. a significant under- or over-estimation of load requirements could result in our facilities not having enough or having too much power to cover their obligations, in which case we would be required to buy or sell power from or to third parties at prevailing market prices. those prices may not be favorable and thus could increase our operating costs.
we may not be able to enter into long-term contracts, which reduce volatility in our results of operations. even when we successfully enter into long-term contracts, our generation businesses are often dependent on one or a limited number of customers and a limited number of fuel suppliers.
many of our generation plants conduct business under long-term sales and supply contracts, which helps these businesses to manage risks by reducing the volatility associated with power and input costs and providing a stable revenue and cost structure. in these instances, we rely on power sales contracts with one or a limited number of customers for the majority of, and in some cases all of, the relevant plant's output and revenues over the term of the power sales contract. the remaining terms of the power sales contracts of our generation plants range from one to 25 years. in many cases, we also limit our exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices by entering into long-term contracts for fuel with a limited number of suppliers. in these instances, the cash flows and results of operations are dependent on the continued ability of customers and suppliers to meet their obligations under the relevant power sales contract or fuel supply contract, respectively. some of our long-term power sales agreements are at prices above current spot market prices and some of our long-term fuel supply contracts are at prices below current market prices. the loss of significant power sales contracts or fuel supply contracts, or the failure by any of the parties to such contracts that prevents us from fulfilling our obligations thereunder, could adversely impact our strategy by resulting in costs that exceed revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, depending on market conditions and regulatory regimes, it may be difficult for us to secure long-term contracts, either where our current contracts are expiring or for new development projects. the inability to enter into long-term contracts could require many of our businesses to purchase inputs at market prices and sell electricity into spot markets, which may not be favorable.
we have sought to reduce counterparty credit risk under our long-term contracts in part by entering into power sales contracts with utilities or other customers of strong credit quality and by obtaining guarantees from certain sovereign governments of the customer's obligations. however, many of our customers do not have, or have failed to maintain, an investment-grade credit rating, and our generation business cannot always obtain government guarantees and if they do, the government does not always have an investment grade credit rating. we have also sought to reduce our credit risk by locating our plants in different geographic areas in order to mitigate the effects of regional economic downturns. however, there can be no assurance that our efforts to mitigate this risk will be successful.
competition is increasing and could adversely affect us.
the power production markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors, many of whom may have extensive and diversified developmental or operating experience (including both domestic and international) and financial resources similar to or greater than ours. further, in recent years, the power production industry has been characterized by strong and increasing competition with respect to both obtaining power sales agreements and acquiring existing power generation assets. in certain markets, these factors have caused reductions in prices contained in new power sales agreements and, in many cases, have caused higher acquisition prices for existing assets through competitive bidding practices. the evolution of competitive electricity markets and the development of highly efficient gas-fired power plants have also caused, or are anticipated to cause, price pressure in certain power markets where we sell or intend to sell power. these competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on us.
62
some of our subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans and their net pension plan obligations may require additional significant contributions.
certain of our subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of their respective employees. of the thirty one such defined benefit plans, five are at u.s. subsidiaries and the remaining plans are at foreign subsidiaries. pension costs are based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, the expected life span of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pension obligations. any of these assumptions could prove to be wrong, resulting in a shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. the company periodically evaluates the value of the pension plan assets to ensure that they will be sufficient to fund the respective pension obligations. the company's exposure to market volatility is mitigated to some extent due to the fact that the asset allocations in our largest plans include a significant weighting of investments in fixed income securities that are less volatile than investments in equity securities. future downturns in the debt and/or equity markets, or the inaccuracy of any of our significant assumptions underlying the estimates of our subsidiaries' pension plan obligations, could result in an increase in pension expense and future funding requirements, which may be material. our subsidiaries who participate in these plans are responsible for satisfying the funding requirements required by law in their respective jurisdiction for any shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. this may necessitate additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could adversely affect the parent company and our subsidiaries' liquidity.
for additional information regarding the funding position of the company's pension plans, see item 7.-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-critical accounting policies and estimates-pension and other postretirement plans and note 15-benefit plans included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data included in this form 10-k.
our business is subject to substantial development uncertainties.
certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates are in various stages of developing and constructing power plants, some but not all of which have signed long-term contracts or made similar arrangements for the sale of electricity. successful completion depends upon overcoming substantial risks, including, but not limited to, risks relating to siting, financing, engineering and construction, permitting, governmental approvals, commissioning delays, or the potential for termination of the power sales contract as a result of a failure to meet certain milestones. for additional information regarding our projects under construction see, item 1.-business-our organization and segments included in this form 10-k.
in certain cases, our subsidiaries may enter into obligations in the development process even though the subsidiaries have not yet secured financing, power purchase arrangements, or other aspects of the development process. for example, in certain cases, our subsidiaries may instruct contractors to begin the construction process or seek to procure equipment even where they do not have financing or a power purchase agreement in place (or conversely, to enter into a power purchase, procurement or other agreement without financing in place). if the project does not proceed, our subsidiaries may remain obligated for certain liabilities even though the project will not proceed. development is inherently uncertain and we may forgo certain development opportunities and we may undertake significant development costs before determining that we will not proceed with a particular project. we believe that capitalized costs for projects under development are recoverable; however, there can be no assurance that any individual project will be completed and reach commercial operation. if these development efforts are not successful, we may abandon a project under development and write off the costs incurred in connection with such project. at the time of abandonment, we would expense all capitalized development costs incurred in connection therewith and could incur additional losses associated with any related contingent liabilities.
in some of our joint venture projects and businesses, we have granted protective rights to minority shareholders or we own less than a majority of the equity in the project or business and do not manage or otherwise control the project or business, which entails certain risks.
we have invested in some joint ventures where our subsidiaries share operational, management, investment and/or other control rights with our joint venture partners. in many cases, we may exert influence over the joint venture pursuant to a management contract, by holding positions on the board of the joint venture company or on management committees and/or through certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. however, we do not always have this type of influence over the project or business in every instance and we may be dependent on our joint venture partners or the management team of the joint venture to operate, manage, invest or otherwise control such projects or businesses. our joint venture partners or the management team of our joint ventures may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources, management and other attributes necessary to operate these projects or businesses optimally, and they may not share our business priorities. in some joint venture agreements where we do have majority control of the voting securities, we have entered into shareholder agreements granting protective minority rights to the other shareholders.
the approval of joint venture partners also may be required for us to receive distributions of funds from jointly owned entities or to transfer our interest in projects or businesses. the control or influence exerted by our joint venture partners may
63
result in operational management and/or investment decisions which are different from the decisions our subsidiaries would make if they operated independently and could impact the profitability and value of these joint ventures. in addition, in the event that a joint venture partner becomes insolvent or bankrupt or is otherwise unable to meet its obligations to the joint venture or its share of liabilities at the joint venture, we may be subject to joint and several liability for these joint ventures, if and to the extent provided for in our governing documents or applicable law.
our renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties including, development, operational and regulatory challenges.
wind generation, our solar projects and our investments in projects such as energy storage are subject to substantial risks. projects of this nature have been developed through advancement in technologies which may not be proven or whose commercial application is limited, and which are unrelated to our core business. some of these business lines are dependent upon favorable regulatory incentives to support continued investment, and there is significant uncertainty about the extent to which such favorable regulatory incentives will be available in the future.
furthermore, production levels for our wind and solar projects may be dependent upon adequate wind or sunlight resulting in volatility in production levels and profitability. for example, for our wind projects, wind resource estimates are based on historical experience when available and on wind resource studies conducted by an independent engineer, and are not expected to reflect actual wind energy production in any given year.
as a result, these types of renewable energy projects face considerable risk relative to our core business, including the risk that favorable regulatory regimes expire or are adversely modified. in addition, because certain of these projects depend on technology outside of our expertise in generation and utility businesses, there are risks associated with our ability to develop and manage such projects profitably. furthermore, at the development or acquisition stage, because of the nascent nature of these industries or the limited experience with the relevant technologies, our ability to predict actual performance results may be hindered and the projects may not perform as predicted. there are also risks associated with the fact that some of these projects exist in markets where long-term fixed price contracts for the major cost and revenue components may be unavailable, which in turn may result in these projects having relatively high levels of volatility. even where available, many of our renewable projects sell power under a feed-in-tariff, which may be eliminated or reduced, which can impact the profitability of these projects, or make money through the sale of emission reductions products, such as certified emissions reductions, renewable energy certificates or renewable obligation certificates, and the price of these products may be volatile.
these projects can be capital-intensive and generally are designed with a view to obtaining third party financing, which may be difficult to obtain. as a result, these capital constraints may reduce our ability to develop these projects or obtain third party financing for these projects. these risks may be exacerbated by the current global economic crisis, including our management's increased focus on liquidity, which may also result in slower growth in the number of projects we can pursue. the economic downturn could also impact the value of our assets in these countries and our ability to develop these projects. if the value of these assets decline, this could result in a material impairment or a series of impairments which are material in the aggregate, which would adversely affect our financial statements.
impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets would negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.
as of december 31, 2015, the company had approximately $1.2 billion of goodwill, which represented approximately 3.1% of the total assets on its consolidated balance sheets. goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. we may be required to evaluate the potential impairment of goodwill outside of the required annual evaluation process if we experience situations, including but not limited to: deterioration in general economic conditions, or our operating or regulatory environment; increased competitive environment; increase in fuel costs, particularly when we are unable to pass through the impact to customers; negative or declining cash flows; loss of a key contract or customer, particularly when we are unable to replace it on equally favorable terms; divestiture of a significant component of our business; or adverse actions or assessments by a regulator. these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment, which could substantially affect our results of operations for those periods. additionally, goodwill may be impaired if our acquisitions do not perform as expected. see the risk factor our acquisitions may not perform as expected for further discussion.
long-lived assets are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives. long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment only when impairment indicators are present whereas goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if potential impairment indicators are present. otherwise, the recoverability assessment of long-lived assets is similar to the potential impairment evaluation of goodwill particularly as it relates to the identification of potential impairment indicators, and making estimates and assumptions to determine fair value, as described above.
64
certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather.
our businesses are affected by variations in general weather patterns and unusually severe weather. our businesses forecast electric sales on the basis of normal weather, which represents a long-term historical average. while we also consider possible variations in normal weather patterns and potential impacts on our facilities and our businesses, there can be no assurance that such planning can prevent these impacts, which can adversely affect our business. generally, demand for electricity peaks in winter and summer. typically, when winters are warmer than expected and summers are cooler than expected, demand for energy is lower, resulting in less demand for electricity than forecasted. significant variations from normal weather where our businesses are located could have a material impact on our results of operations.
in addition, we are dependent upon hydrological conditions prevailing from time to time in the broad geographic regions in which our hydroelectric generation facilities are located. if hydrological conditions result in droughts or other conditions that negatively affect our hydroelectric generation business, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
information security breaches could harm our business.
a security breach of our information technology systems or plant control systems used to manage and monitor operations could impact the reliability of our generation fleets and/or the reliability of our transmission and distribution systems. a security breach that impairs our technology infrastructure could disrupt normal business operations and affect our ability to control our transmission and distribution assets, access customer information and limit our communications with third parties. our security measures may not prevent such security breaches. any loss or corruption of confidential or proprietary data through a breach could impair our reputation, expose us to legal claims, or impact our ability to make collections or otherwise impact our operations, and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
our acquisitions may not perform as expected.
historically, acquisitions have been a significant part of our growth strategy. we may continue to grow our business through acquisitions. although acquired businesses may have significant operating histories, we will have a limited or no history of owning and operating many of these businesses and possibly limited or no experience operating in the country or region where these businesses are located. some of these businesses may have been government owned and some may be operated as part of a larger integrated utility prior to their acquisition. if we were to acquire any of these types of businesses, there can be no assurance that:
•   we will be successful in transitioning them to private ownership;
•   such businesses will perform as expected;
•   integration or other one-time costs will not be greater than expected;
•   we will not incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities;
•   such businesses will generate sufficient cash flow to support the indebtedness incurred to acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to develop them; or
•   the rate of return from such businesses will justify our decision to invest capital to acquire them.
risks associated with governmental regulation and laws our operations are subject to significant government regulation and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the law or regulatory schemes.
our ability to predict, influence or respond appropriately to changes in law or regulatory schemes, including any ability to obtain expected or contracted increases in electricity tariff or contract rates or tariff adjustments for increased expenses, could adversely impact our results of operations or our ability to meet publicly announced projections or analysts' expectations. furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or changes in the application or interpretation of regulatory provisions in jurisdictions where we operate, particularly at our utilities where electricity tariffs are subject to regulatory review or approval, could adversely affect our business, including, but not limited to:
•   changes in the determination, definition or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass-through costs to be included in the rates we charge our customers, including but not limited to costs incurred to upgrade our power plants to comply with more stringent environmental regulations;
•   changes in the determination of what is an appropriate rate of return on invested capital or a determination that a utility's operating income or the rates it charges customers are too high, resulting in a reduction of rates or consumer rebates;
•   changes in the definition or determination of controllable or non-controllable costs;
•   adverse changes in tax law;
65
•   changes in law or regulation which limit or otherwise affect the ability of our counterparties (including sovereign or private parties) to fulfill their obligations (including payment obligations) to us or our subsidiaries;
•   changes in environmental law which impose additional costs or limit the dispatch of our generating facilities within our subsidiaries;
•   changes in the definition of events which may or may not qualify as changes in economic equilibrium;
•   changes in the timing of tariff increases;
•   other changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions;
•   other changes related to licensing or permitting which affect our ability to conduct business; or
•   other changes that impact the short or long term price-setting mechanism in the markets where we operate.
any of the above events may result in lower margins for the affected businesses, which can adversely affect our business.
in many countries where we conduct business, the regulatory environment is constantly changing and it may be difficult to predict the impact of the regulations on our businesses. on july 21, 2010, president obama signed the dodd-frank act. while the bulk of regulations contained in the dodd-frank act regulate financial institutions and their products, there are several provisions related to corporate governance, executive compensation, disclosure and other matters which relate to public companies generally. the types of provisions described above are currently not expected to have a material impact on the company or its results of operations. furthermore, while the dodd-frank act substantially expands the regulation regarding the trading, clearing and reporting of derivative transactions, the dodd-frank act provides for commercial end-user exemptions which may apply to our derivative transactions. however, even with the exemption, the dodd-frank act could still have a material adverse impact on the company, as the regulation of derivatives (which includes capital and margin requirements for non-exempt companies), could limit the availability of derivative transactions that we use to reduce interest rate, commodity and currency risks, which would increase our exposure to these risks. even if derivative transactions remain available, the costs to enter into these transactions may increase, which could adversely (1) affect the operating results of certain projects; (2) cause us to default on certain types of contracts where we are contractually obligated to hedge certain risks, such as project financing agreements; (3) prevent us from developing new projects where interest rate hedging is required; (4) cause the company to abandon certain of its hedging strategies and transactions, thereby increasing our exposure to interest rate, commodity and currency risk; (5) and/or consume substantial liquidity by forcing the company to post cash and/or other permitted collateral in support of these derivatives. in addition to the dodd-frank act, in 2012, the emir became effective. emir includes regulations related to the trading, reporting and clearing of derivatives and the impacts described above could also result from our (or our subsidiaries') efforts to comply with emir. it is also possible that additional similar regulations may be passed in other jurisdictions where we conduct business. any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the company.
our business in the united states is subject to the provisions of various laws and regulations administered in whole or in part by the ferc and nerc, including purpa, the federal power act, and the epact 2005. actions by the ferc, nerc and by state utility commissions can have a material effect on our operations.
epact 2005 authorizes the ferc to remove the obligation of electric utilities under section 210 of purpa to enter into new contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity from or to qfs if certain market conditions are met. pursuant to this authority, the ferc has instituted a rebuttable presumption that utilities located within the control areas of the midwest independent transmission system operator, inc., pjm interconnection, l.l.c., iso new england, inc., the nyiso and the electric reliability council of texas, inc. are not required to purchase or sell power from or to qfs above a certain size. in addition, the ferc is authorized under epact 2005 to remove the purchase/sale obligations of individual utilities on a case-by-case basis. while this law does not affect existing contracts, as a result of the changes to purpa, our qfs may face a more difficult market environment when their current long-term contracts expire.
epact 2005 repealed puhca 1935 and enacted puhca 2005 in its place. puhca 1935 had the effect of requiring utility holding companies to operate in geographically proximate regions and therefore limited the range of potential combinations and mergers among utilities. by comparison, puhca 2005 has no such restrictions and simply provides the ferc and state utility commissions with enhanced access to the books and records of certain utility holding companies. the repeal of puhca 1935 removed barriers to mergers and other potential combinations which could result in the creation of large, geographically dispersed utility holding companies. these entities may have enhanced financial strength and therefore an increased ability to compete with us in the united states generation market.
in accordance with congressional mandates in the epact 1992 and now in epact 2005, the ferc has strongly encouraged competition in wholesale electric markets. increased competition may have the effect of lowering our operating margins. among other steps, the ferc has encouraged rtos and isos to develop demand response bidding programs as a mechanism for responding to peak electric demand. these programs may reduce the value of our peaking assets which rely on very high prices during a relatively small number of hours to recover their costs. similarly, the ferc is encouraging the
66
construction of new transmission infrastructure in accordance with provisions of epact 2005. although new transmission lines may increase market opportunities, they may also increase the competition in our existing markets.
while the ferc continues to promote competition, some state utility commissions have reversed course and begun to encourage the construction of generation facilities by traditional utilities to be paid for on a cost-of-service basis by retail ratepayers. such actions have the effect of reducing sale opportunities in the competitive wholesale generating markets in which we operate.
ferc has civil penalty authority over violations of any provision of part ii of the fpa which concerns wholesale generation or transmission, as well as any rule or order issued thereunder. ferc is authorized to assess a maximum civil penalty of $1 million per violation for each day that the violation continues. the fpa also provides for the assessment of criminal fines and imprisonment for violations under the fpa. this penalty authority was enhanced in epact 2005. with this expanded enforcement authority, violations of the fpa and ferc's regulations could potentially have more serious consequences than in the past.
pursuant to epact 2005, the nerc has been certified by ferc as the electric reliability organization (ero) to develop mandatory and enforceable electric system reliability standards applicable throughout the u.s. to improve the overall reliability of the electric grid. these standards are subject to ferc review and approval. once approved, the reliability standards may be enforced by ferc independently, or, alternatively, by the ero and regional reliability organizations with responsibility for auditing, investigating and otherwise ensuring compliance with reliability standards, subject to ferc oversight. monetary penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation may be assessed for violations of the reliability standards.
our utility businesses in the u.s. face significant regulation by their respective state utility commissions. the regulatory discretion is reasonably broad in both indiana and ohio and includes regulation as to services and facilities, the valuation of property, the construction, purchase, or lease of electric generating facilities, the classification of accounts, rates of depreciation, the increase or decrease in retail rates and charges, the issuance of certain securities, the acquisition and sale of some public utility properties or securities and certain other matters. these businesses face the risk of unexpected or adverse regulatory action which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. see item 1.-business-us sbu-u.s. businesses-u.s. utilities for further information on the regulation faced by our u.s. utilities.
our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations.
our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations by many federal, regional, state and local authorities, international treaties and foreign governmental authorities. these laws and regulations generally concern emissions into the air, effluents into the water, use of water, wetlands preservation, remediation of contamination, waste disposal, endangered species and noise regulation, among others. failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to obtain or comply with any necessary environmental permits pursuant to such laws and regulations could result in fines or other sanctions. environmental laws and regulations affecting power generation and distribution are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. congress and other domestic and foreign governmental authorities have either considered or implemented various laws and regulations to restrict or tax certain emissions, particularly those involving air emissions and water discharges. see the various descriptions of these laws and regulations contained in item 1.-business of this form 10-k. these laws and regulations have imposed, and proposed laws and regulations could impose in the future, additional costs on the operation of our power plants. we have incurred and will continue to incur significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these and other environmental laws and regulations. changes in, or new development of, environmental restrictions may force the company to incur significant expenses or expenses that may exceed our estimates. there can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any increased environmental costs from our customers or that our business, financial condition, including recorded asset values or results of operations, would not be materially and adversely affected by such expenditures or any changes in domestic or foreign environmental laws and regulations.
our businesses are subject to enforcement initiatives from environmental regulatory agencies.
the epa has pursued an enforcement initiative against coal-fired generating plants alleging wide-spread violations of the new source review and prevention of significant deterioration provisions of the caa. the epa has brought suit against a number of companies and has obtained settlements with many of these companies over such allegations. the allegations typically involve claims that a company made major modifications to a coal-fired generating unit without proper permit approval and without installing best available control technology. the principal, but not exclusive, focus of this epa enforcement initiative is emissions of so2 and nox. in connection with this enforcement initiative, the epa has imposed fines and required companies to install improved pollution control technologies to reduce emissions of so2 and nox. there can be no assurance that foreign environmental regulatory agencies in countries in which our subsidiaries operate will not pursue similar enforcement initiatives under relevant laws and regulations.
67
regulators, politicians, non-governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about greenhouse gas, or ghg, emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change and are taking actions which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
as discussed in item 1.-business, at the international, federal and various regional and state levels, rules are in effect and policies are under development to regulate ghg emissions, thereby effectively putting a cost on such emissions in order to create financial incentives to reduce them. in 2015, the company's subsidiaries operated businesses which had total co2 emissions of approximately 67.6 million metric tonnes, approximately 27.4 million of which were emitted by businesses located in the u.s. (both figures ownership adjusted). the company uses co2 emission estimation methodologies supported by "the greenhouse gas protocol" reporting standard on ghg emissions. for existing power generation plants, co2 emissions data are either obtained directly from plant continuous emission monitoring systems or calculated from actual fuel heat inputs and fuel type co2 emission factors. the estimated annual co2 emissions from fossil fuel electric power generation facilities of the company's subsidiaries that are in construction or development and have received the necessary air permits for commercial operations are approximately 7.8 million metric tonnes (ownership adjusted). this overall estimate is based on a number of projections and assumptions which may prove to be incorrect, such as the forecasted dispatch, anticipated plant efficiency, fuel type, co2 emissions rates and our subsidiaries' achieving completion of such construction and development projects. however, it is certain that the projects under construction or development when completed will increase emissions of our portfolio and therefore could increase the risks associated with regulation of ghg emissions. because there is significant uncertainty regarding these estimates, actual emissions from these projects under construction or development may vary substantially from these estimates.
the non-utility, generation subsidiaries of the company often seek to pass on any costs arising from co2 emissions to contract counterparties, but there can be no assurance that such subsidiaries of the company will effectively pass such costs onto the contract counterparties or that the cost and burden associated with any dispute over which party bears such costs would not be burdensome and costly to the relevant subsidiaries of the company. the utility subsidiaries of the company may seek to pass on any costs arising from co2 emissions to customers, but there can be no assurance that such subsidiaries of the company will effectively pass such costs to the customers, or that they will be able to fully or timely recover such costs.
foreign, federal, state or regional regulation of ghg emissions could have a material adverse impact on the company's financial performance. the actual impact on the company's financial performance and the financial performance of the company's subsidiaries will depend on a number of factors, including among others, the degree and timing of ghg emissions reductions required under any such legislation or regulation, the cost of emissions reduction equipment and the price and availability of offsets, the extent to which market based compliance options are available, the extent to which our subsidiaries would be entitled to receive ghg emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market and the impact of such legislation or regulation on the ability of our subsidiaries to recover costs incurred through rate increases or otherwise. as a result of these factors, our cost of compliance could be substantial and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
in january 2005, based on european community "directive 2003/87/ec on greenhouse gas emission allowance trading," the eu ets commenced operation as the largest multi-country ghg emission trading scheme in the world. on february 16, 2005, the kyoto protocol became effective. the kyoto protocol requires all developed countries that have ratified it to substantially reduce their ghg emissions, including co2. however, the united states never ratified the kyoto protocol and, to date, compliance with the kyoto protocol and the eu ets has not had a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
in december 2015, the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change ("unfccc") convened for the 21st conference of the parties in paris, france. the result was the so-called paris agreement. we anticipate that the paris agreement will continue the trend towards the efforts to de-carbonize the global economy and to further limit ghg emissions, including in those countries where the company does business. it is difficult to predict the nature, timing and scope of such regulation but it could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial performance.
in the u.s., there currently is no federal legislation imposing a mandatory ghg emission reduction programs (including for co2) affecting the electric power generation facilities of the company's subsidiaries. however, the epa has adopted regulations pertaining to ghg emissions that require new sources of ghg emissions of over 100,000 tons per year, and existing sources planning physical changes that would increase their ghg emissions by more than 75,000 tons per year, to obtain new source review permits from the epa prior to construction or modification. additionally, the epa has promulgated a rule establishing new source performance standards for co2 emissions for newly constructed and modified/reconstructed fossil-fueled eusgus larger than 25 mw. the epa has also promulgated a rule, the clean power plan ("cpp"), that requires existing eusgus to begin reducing ghg emissions starting in 2022 with the full reduction requirement in 2030. under the cpp, states are required to develop and submit plans that establish performance standards or, through emissions trading programs, otherwise meet a state-wide emissions rate average or mass-based goal. for further discussion of the regulation of ghg emission, including the u.s. supreme court's recently issued orders staying implementation of the cpp, see item 1.-
68
business-environmental and land-use regulations-united states environmental and land-use legislation and regulations-greenhouse gas emissions above.
such regulations, and in particular regulations applying to modified or existing eusgus, could increase our costs directly and indirectly and have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations. see item 1.-business of this form 10-k for further discussion about these environmental agreements, laws and regulations.
at the state level, the rggi, a cap-and-trade program covering co2 emissions from electric power generation facilities in the northeast, became effective in january 2009, and california has adopted comprehensive legislation and regulation that requires mandatory ghg reductions from several industrial sectors, including the electric power generation industry. at this time, other than with regard to rggi (further described below) and proposed hawaii regulations relating to the collection of fees on ghg emissions, the impact of both of which we do not expect to be material, the company cannot estimate the costs of compliance with united states federal, regional or state ghg emissions reduction legislation or initiatives, due to the fact that most of these proposals are not being actively pursued or are in the early stages of development and any final regulations or laws, if adopted, could vary drastically from current proposals; in the case of california, we anticipate no material impact due to the fact that we expect such costs will be passed through to our offtakers under the terms of existing tolling agreements.
the regional auctions of rggi allowances needed to be acquired by power generators to comply with state programs implementing rggi occur approximately every quarter. our subsidiary in maryland is our only subsidiary that was subject to rggi in 2015. of the approximately 27.4 million metric tonnes of co2 emitted in the united states by our subsidiaries in 2015 (ownership adjusted), approximately 1.4 million metric tonnes were emitted by our subsidiary in maryland. the company estimates that the rggi compliance costs could be approximately $3.4 million for 2016. there is a risk that our actual compliance costs under rggi will differ from our estimates by a material amount and that our model could underestimate our costs of compliance.
in addition to government regulators, other groups such as politicians, environmentalists and other private parties have expressed increasing concern about ghg emissions. for example, certain financial institutions have expressed concern about providing financing for facilities which would emit ghgs, which can affect our ability to obtain capital, or if we can obtain capital, to receive it on commercially viable terms. further, rating agencies may decide to downgrade our credit ratings based on the emissions of the businesses operated by our subsidiaries or increased compliance costs which could make financing unattractive. in addition, plaintiffs have brought tort lawsuits against the company because of its subsidiaries' ghg emissions. unless the united states congress acts to preempt such suits as part of comprehensive federal legislation, additional lawsuits may be brought against the company or its subsidiaries in the future. while the litigation mentioned has been dismissed, it is impossible to predict whether similar future lawsuits are likely to prevail or result in damages awards or other relief. consequently, it is impossible to determine whether such lawsuits are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
furthermore, according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change, physical risks from climate change could include, but are not limited to, increased runoff and earlier spring peak discharge in many glacier and snow-fed rivers, warming of lakes and rivers, an increase in sea level, changes and variability in precipitation and in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. physical impacts may have the potential to significantly affect the company's business and operations, and any such potential impact may render it more difficult for our businesses to obtain financing. for example, extreme weather events could result in increased downtime and operation and maintenance costs at the electric power generation facilities and support facilities of the company's subsidiaries. variations in weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity also would be expected to affect the energy needs of customers. a decrease in energy consumption could decrease the revenues of the company's subsidiaries. in addition, while revenues would be expected to increase if the energy consumption of customers increased, such increase could prompt the need for additional investment in generation capacity. changes in the temperature of lakes and rivers and changes in precipitation that result in drought could adversely affect the operations of the fossil fuel-fired electric power generation facilities of the company's subsidiaries. changes in temperature, precipitation and snow pack conditions also could affect the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation.
in addition to potential physical risks noted by the intergovernmental panel on climate change, there could be damage to the reputation of the company and its subsidiaries due to public perception of ghg emissions by the company's subsidiaries, and any such negative public perception or concerns could ultimately result in a decreased demand for electric power generation or distribution from our subsidiaries. the level of ghg emissions made by subsidiaries of the company is not a factor in the compensation of executives of the company.
if any of the foregoing risks materialize, costs may increase or revenues may decrease and there could be a material adverse effect on the electric power generation businesses of the company's subsidiaries and on the company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
69
tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
our subsidiaries have operations in the u.s. and various non-u.s. jurisdictions. as such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the u.s. federal, state and local governments and of many non-u.s. jurisdictions. from time to time, legislative measures may be enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax positions regarding income or other taxes. there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these legislative measures.
for example, the u.s. is considering corporate tax reform that may significantly change u.s. international tax rules and corporate tax rates. additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine how and where cross-border international trade is subjected to tax are evolving. the organization for economic cooperation and development ("oecd"), in coordination with the g8 and g20, recently concluded its base erosion and profit shifting project ("beps") with a series of recommendations that many tax jurisdictions have adopted, or may adopt in the future, as law. as these and other tax laws, related regulations and double-tax conventions change, our financial results could be materially impacted. given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency, it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our results of operations.
in addition, united states federal, state and local, as well as non-united states, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. there can be no assurance that our tax positions will be sustained if challenged by relevant tax authorities and if not sustained, there could be a material impact on our results of operations.
we and our affiliates are subject to material litigation and regulatory proceedings.
we and our affiliates are parties to material litigation and regulatory proceedings. see item 3.-legal proceedings below. there can be no assurances that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations key topics in management's discussion and analysis our discussion covers the following:
•   strategic performance and overview of 2015 results
•   review of consolidated results of operations

•   capital resources and liquidity overview of 2015 results and strategic performance in 2015, we faced tough macroeconomic headwinds, including up to 30% devaluation in some of our key currencies, including the brazilian real, colombian peso and euro. we also saw more than 40% declines in oil and natural gas prices, which have an impact on our businesses in the dominican republic, ohio and northern ireland. additionally, brazil's gdp continued to contract. despite these continuing challenging conditions, we did what we are good at - adapted to the changes in circumstances and took actions to mitigate their impact on our businesses and on our financial results. we successfully executed on our strategy and achieved the majority of our objectives by: delivering proportional free cash flow of $1,241 million, up 39% compared to 2014, and adjusted eps of $1.22; prudently allocating our capital; and advancing select platform expansion projects across our portfolio.
management's strategic priorities management is focused on the following priorities:
78
•   reducing complexity: by exiting businesses and markets where we do not have a competitive advantage, we are simplifying our portfolio and reducing risk. during 2015, we announced or closed $787 million in equity proceeds from the sales or sell-downs of seven businesses.
•   leveraging our platforms: we are focusing our growth on platform expansions in markets where we already operate and have a competitive advantage to realize attractive risk-adjusted returns. we currently have 5,620 mw under construction, representing $7 billion in total capital expenditures, with 85% of aes' $1.2 billion in equity already funded. we expect the majority of these projects to come on-line through 2018. beyond the projects we currently have under construction, we will continue to advance select projects from our development pipeline.
•   performance excellence: we strive to be the low-cost manager of a portfolio of assets and to derive synergies and scale from our businesses. in november, we launched a $150 million cost reduction and revenue enhancement initiative. this initiative will include overhead reductions, procurement efficiencies and operational improvements. we expect to achieve at least $50 million in savings in 2016, ramping up to $150 million, including modest revenue enhancements, in 2018.
•   expanding access to capital: we are building strategic partnerships at the project and business level. through these partnerships, we aim to optimize our risk-adjusted returns in our existing businesses and growth projects. by selling down portions of certain businesses, we can adjust our global exposure to commodity, fuel, country and other macroeconomic risks. partial sell-downs of our assets can also serve to highlight or enhance the value of businesses in our portfolio.
•   allocating capital in a disciplined manner: our top priority is to maximize risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders, which we achieve by investing our discretionary cash and recycling the capital we receive from asset sales and strategic partnerships. in 2015, we generated substantial cash by executing on our strategy, which we allocated in line with our capital allocation framework:
◦   used $345 million to prepay and refinance parent debt;
◦   returned $757 million to shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly dividends;
▪   increased our quarterly dividend by 10%, to $0.11 per share, beginning in the first quarter of 2016;
◦   invested $114 million in our subsidiaries, largely for projects that are currently under construction.

diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased by 60% to $0.44 primarily due to higher impairment expense and lower gains from sales of businesses, partially offset by lower debt extinguishment expense.
adjusted eps, a non-gaap measure, decreased by 6% to $1.22 primarily due to the devaluation of foreign currencies in latin america and europe, the impact of lower commodity prices in certain markets, and lower demand in brazil. these negative impacts were partially offset by a 5% reduction in shares outstanding, lower parent interest expense, improved hydrological conditions in panama, and contributions from new businesses, including mong duong in vietnam.
net cash provided by operating activities increased by 19% to $2.1 billion primarily due to the timing of collections in the dominican republic as well as increases at the parent company primarily driven by lower interest payments and lower payments for capital expenditures, partially offset by collections on lower margins resulting from economic slowdown, timing of energy purchases and higher interest payments in brazil.
proportional free cash flow increased by 39% to $1.2 billion primarily due to the timing of collections in the dominican republic as well as increases at the parent company primarily driven by lower interest payments and lower payments for maintenance capital expenditures.
safe operations safety is our first value and a top priority. we consistently analyze and evaluate our safety performance in order to capture lessons learned and strengthen mitigation plans that improve our safety performance.

consolidated revenue and operating margin - executive summary
(in millions)
year ended december 31, 2015
consolidated revenue - revenue decreased $2.2 billion, or 13%, to $15.0 billion in 2015 compared to $17.1 billion in 2014. this decrease was primarily driven by unfavorable fx impacts of $2.5 billion, primarily in brazil ($2.2 billion) and colombia ($179 million). additionally, there were lower volumes at the us utilities, primarily at dpl, and outages, milder weather, and lower demand at ipl. finally, there were lower prices in the dominican republic and el salvador (primarily resulting from lower pass-through costs). these decreases were partially offset by higher tariffs at eletropaulo and sul (including higher pass-through costs), the reversal of a contingent regulatory liability at eletropaulo, higher capacity prices at dpl, and the commencement of principal operations at mong duong in april 2015.
consolidated operating margin - operating margin decreased $222 million, or 7%, to $2.9 billion in 2015 compared to $3.1 billion in 2014. this decrease was driven by unfavorable fx impacts of $368 million, primarily in brazil ($235 million) and colombia ($83 million). in addition, brazil was impacted by lower demand, lower hydrology, and higher fixed costs and the dominican republic was impacted by lower commodities and lower availability. these decreases were partially offset by the impact of higher tariffs in brazil as discussed above, lower spot prices on energy purchases at tietê, higher generation and lower energy purchases driven by improved hydrological conditions in panama, higher prices at chivor driven by a strong el niño, and higher availability at gener and masinloc.
year ended december 31, 2014
consolidated revenue - revenue increased $1.3 billion, or 8%, to $17.1 billion in 2014 compared to $15.9 billion in 2013. this increase was driven by higher tariffs (primarily pass-through costs) at the brazil utilities and at ipl, higher spot prices at tietê, and regulatory retail rate increases at dpl. these increases were partially offset by unfavorable fx impacts of $752 million, primarily in brazil ($630 million), argentina ($69 million) and colombia ($30 million).
consolidated operating margin - operating margin decreased $159 million, or 5%, to $3.1 billion in 2014 compared to $3.2 billion in 2013. this decrease was driven by unfavorable fx impacts of $124 million, primarily in brazil ($97 million). in addition, margins were negatively impacted by higher fixed costs at eletropaulo, lower hydrology and higher spot purchase prices tietê, and lower availability at kilroot, maritza, and masinloc. these decreases were partially offset by higher tariffs and a non-recurring 2013 charge related to the recognition of a contingent regulatory liability at eletropaulo, and higher generation volumes and prices at chivor.
see item 7.-sbu performance analysis of this form 10-k for additional discussion and analysis of operating results for each sbu.
consolidated results of operations - other general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include expenses related to corporate staff functions and/or initiatives, executive management, finance, legal, human resources and information systems, as well as global development costs.
general and administrative expenses increased $9 million, or 5%, to $196 million in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to increased business development costs and employee-related costs partially offset by decreased professional fees.
general and administrative expenses decreased $33 million, or 15%, to $187 million in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to lower employee-related costs and business development costs.
81
interest expense interest expense decreased $35 million, or 2%, to $1.4 billion in 2015 from $1.5 billion in 2014. the decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest expense of $63 million at the parent company due to a reduction in debt principal, and a $64 million reversal of interest expense previously recognized on a contingent regulatory liability at eletropaulo. these decreases were partially offset by an increase at mong duong as the plant commenced operations in the first half of 2015 and ceased capitalizing interest, as well as the impact of the 2014 contingent interest reversal at sul discussed below.
interest expense decreased $11 million, or 1%, to $1.5 billion in 2014 from $1.5 billion in 2013. this decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest expense of $53 million at the parent company due to a reduction in debt principal, and a $48 million reversal of contingent interest accruals associated with disputed purchased energy obligations at sul for which it was determined, based on developments during the second quarter of 2014, that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome for the payment of interest on the disputed obligation was no longer probable. these decreases were partially offset by income of $34 million in the prior year resulting from the ineffectiveness on derivative interest rate swaps accounted for as cash flow hedges at puerto rico, and higher interest expense of $24 million at gener due to an increase in debt principal.
interest income interest income increased $159 million, or 44%, to $524 million in 2015 from $365 million in 2014. the increase was primarily due to interest income of $114 million recognized in 2015 on the financing element of the service concession arrangement at muong duong, as well as an increase of $54 million at eletropaulo and sul resulting from higher interest rates and an increase in regulatory assets.
interest income increased $90 million, or 33%, to $365 million in 2014 from $275 million in 2013. the increase was primarily due to interest income of $59 million recognized on foninvemem iii receivables in argentina, which satisfied the criteria for revenue recognition in the fourth quarter of 2014, as well as an increase of $23 million at eletropaulo resulting from higher interest rates and an increase in regulatory assets. see note 7-financing receivables included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for further information.
loss on extinguishment of debt loss on extinguishment of debt was $186 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. this loss was primarily related to expense of $105 million, $22 million, and $19 million recognized on debt extinguishments at the parent company, ipl, and the dominican republic, respectively.
loss on extinguishment of debt was $261 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. this loss was primarily related to expense of $193 million, $31 million, and $20 million recognized on debt extinguishments at the parent company, dpl, and gener, respectively.
loss on extinguishment of debt was $229 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. this was primarily related to debt extinguishments at the parent company and at masinloc. see note 12-debt included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for further information.
other income and expense other income was $83 million, $124 million, and $125 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. other expense was $65 million, $68 million, and $76 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. see note 20-other income and expense included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for further information.
gain on sale of businesses gain on sale of businesses was $29 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, which was primarily related to the sale of armenia mountain.
gain on sale of businesses was $358 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, which was primarily related to the sale of 45% of the company's interest in masinloc, as well as the sale of u.k. wind (operating projects).
gain on disposal and sale of investments for the year ended december 31, 2013 was $26 million, which was primarily related to the sale of our remaining 20% interest in cartagena as well as the sale of our 10% equity interest in trinidad generation unlimited. see note 8-investments in and advances to affiliates, note 16-equity, and note 24-dispositions and held-for-sale businesses included in item 8.-financial statements and supplemental data of this form 10-k for further information.
goodwill impairment expense the company recognized goodwill impairment expense of $317 million, $164 million, and $372 million for the years
82
ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. see note 10-goodwill and other intangible assets included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for further information.
asset impairment expense the company recognized asset impairment expense of $285 million, $91 million and $95 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. see note 21-asset impairment expense included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for further information.
income tax expense income tax expense increased $46 million, or 11%, to $465 million in 2015. the company's effective tax rates were 41% and 27% for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
the net increase in the 2015 effective tax rate was due, in part, to the current year nondeductible impairment of goodwill at our u.s. utility, dpl and chilean withholding taxes offset by the release of valuation allowance at certain of our businesses in brazil, vietnam and the u.s. further, the 2014 rate was impacted by the items described below.
income tax expense increased $76 million, or 22%, to $419 million in 2014. the company's effective tax rates were 27% and 33% for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
the net decrease in the 2014 effective tax rate was due, in part, to the 2014 sale of approximately 45% of the company's interest in masin aes pte ltd., which owns the company's business interests in the philippines, and the 2014 sale of the company's interests in four u.k. wind operating projects. neither of these transactions gave rise to income tax expense. further, the 2014 effective tax rate benefited from the release of valuation allowance against u.s. capital loss carryforwards and a change in tax status at a subsidiary operating in the dominican republic. offsetting these items is the unfavorable impact of chilean income tax law reform enacted in the third quarter of 2014. see note 16-equity for additional information regarding the sale of approximately 45% of the company's interest in masin-aes pte ltd. see note 24-dispositions and held-for-sale businesses for additional information regarding the sale of the company's interests in four u.k wind operating projects.
our effective tax rate reflects the tax effect of significant operations outside the u.s., which are generally taxed at rates lower than the u.s. statutory rate of 35%. a future proportionate change in the composition of income before income taxes from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions could impact our periodic effective tax rate. the company also benefits from reduced tax rates in certain countries as a result of satisfying specific commitments regarding employment and capital investment. see note 22-income taxes for additional information regarding these reduced rates.

(1) includes gains of $247 million, $172 million and $60 million on foreign currency derivative contracts for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
the company recognized a net foreign currency transaction gain of $105 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily due to gains of:
•   $124 million in argentina, due to the favorable impact from foreign currency derivatives related to government receivables, partially offset by losses from the devaluation of the argentine peso associated with u.s. dollar denominated debt, and losses at termoandes (a u.s. dollar functional currency subsidiary) primarily associated with cash and accounts receivable balances in local currency,
•   $29 million in colombia, primarily due to the depreciation of the colombian peso, positively impacting chivor (a u.s. dollar functional currency subsidiary) due to liabilities denominated in colombian pesos,
•   $11 million in the united kingdom, primarily due to the depreciation of the pound sterling, resulting in gains at ballylumford holdings (a u.s. dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with intercompany notes payable
83
denominated in pound sterling, and these gains were partially offset by losses of:
•   $31 million at the aes corporation primarily due to decreases in the valuation of intercompany notes receivable denominated in foreign currency, resulting from the weakening of the euro and british pound during the year, partially offset by gains related to foreign currency option purchases, and
•   $18 million in chile primarily due to the devaluation of the chilean peso at gener (a u.s. dollar functional currency subsidiary) from working capital denominated in chilean pesos, partially offset by gains on foreign currency derivatives.
the company recognized a net foreign currency transaction gain of $11 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily due to gains of:
•   $66 million in argentina, due to the favorable impact from foreign currency derivatives related to government receivables, partially offset by losses from the devaluation of the argentine peso associated with u.s. dollar denominated debt, and losses at termoandes (a u.s. dollar functional currency subsidiary) primarily associated with cash and accounts receivable balances in local currency, and the purchase of argentine sovereign bonds,
•   $17 million in colombia, primarily due to a 23% depreciation of the colombian peso, positively impacting chivor (a u.s. dollar functional currency subsidiary) due to liabilities denominated in colombian pesos, primarily income tax payable and accounts payable,
•   $12 million in the united kingdom, primarily due to a 6% depreciation of the pound sterling, resulting in gains at ballylumford holdings (a u.s. dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with intercompany notes payable denominated in pound sterling, and gains related to foreign currency derivatives, and
•   $11 million in the philippines, primarily due to amortization of frozen embedded derivatives and a 4% appreciation of the philippine peso against the u.s. dollar, resulting in a revaluation of cash accounts, customer receivables, and deferred tax asset.
these gains were partially offset by losses of:
•   $34 million at the aes corporation primarily due to decreases in the valuation of intercompany notes receivable denominated in foreign currency, resulting from the weakening of the euro and british pound during the year, partially offset by gains related to foreign currency option purchases,
•   $30 million in chile primarily due to a 16% devaluation of the chilean peso, resulting in a $39 million loss at gener (a u.s. dollar functional currency subsidiary) from working capital denominated in chilean pesos, primarily cash, accounts receivable and vat receivables, partially offset by income of $9 million on foreign currency derivatives, and
•   $14 million in mexico, primarily due to a 13% devaluation of the mexican peso, resulting in a loss at tegtep and merida (u.s. dollar functional currency subsidiaries) from working capital denominated in pesos (primarily cash, recoverable tax, and vat).
the company recognized a net foreign currency transaction loss of $22 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 primarily due to losses of:
•   $20 million in chile, primarily due to a 9% weakening of the chilean peso, resulting in losses at gener (a u.s. dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with net working capital denominated in chilean pesos, mainly cash, accounts receivables and tax receivables, partially offset by gains related to foreign currency derivatives,
•   $12 million in brazil, primarily due to a 15% weakening of the brazilian real resulting in losses mainly associated with u.s. dollar denominated liabilities, and
•   $10 million in the philippines (a u.s. dollar functional currency subsidiary beginning in 2013), primarily due to the 8% weakening of the philippine peso, resulting in revaluation of cash accounts, customer receivables and deferred tax assets.
other non-operating expense other non-operating expense was zero, $128 million and $129 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. see note 9-other non-operating expense included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for further information.
net equity in earnings of affiliates net equity in earnings of affiliates increased $86 million, or 453%, to $105 million in 2015 from $19 million in 2014. the increase was primarily due to the 2015 restructuring of guacolda in chile, which increased the company's equity investment and resulted in additional equity earnings, as well as the 2014 impairment at elsta discussed below.
84
net equity in earnings of affiliates decreased $6 million to $19 million in 2014 from $25 million in 2013. the decrease was primarily a result of an asset impairment charge at elsta due to long lived assets that were determined to not be recoverable of which our share was $41 million. these items were partially offset by a $22 million lower loss recognized at entek on an embedded foreign currency derivative and a $19 million increase as a result of the sale of equity interests in srp. see note 8-investments in and advances to affiliates included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for further information.
income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $69 million, or 18%, to $456 million in 2015 from $387 million in 2014 as a result of:
•   an increase at mong duong due to commencement of operations in the current year,
•   an increase at gener primarily due to the restructuring of guacolda,
•   an increase at masinloc due to increased earnings and the 2014 sale of a noncontrolling interest in that business partially offset by
•   a decrease at buffalo gap iii resulting from the asset impairment expense allocation to the tax equity partner, and
•   a decease at eletropaulo resulting from unfavorable foreign exchange and lower demand.
income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $59 million, or 13%, to $387 million in 2014 from $446 million in 2013 as a result of:
•   a decrease at tietê due to lower earnings resulting from poor hydrology and increased prices for purchased energy,
•   a decrease at uruguaiana due to a favorable arbitration settlement in 2013, and
•   a decrease at panama related to poor hydrology.
loss from discontinued operations total loss from discontinued operations was zero, $29 million, and $179 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. see note 23-discontinued operations included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for further information.
net income attributable to the aes corporation net income attributable to the aes corporation decreased $463 million to $306 million in 2015 from $769 million in 2014. the key drivers of the decrease included:
•   higher impairment expense
•   lower gains from the sale of businesses these increases were partially offset by:
•   lower debt extinguishment expense net income attributable to the aes corporation increased $655 million to $769 million in 2014 from $114 million in 2013. the key drivers of the increase included:
•   higher gains from the sale of businesses
•   lower impairment expense
•   lower general and administrative expenses sbu performance analysis non-gaap measures adjusted operating margin, adjusted ptc, adjusted eps, and proportional free cash flow are non-gaap supplemental measures that are used by management and external users of our consolidated financial statements such as investors, industry analysts and lenders.
adjusted operating margin - operating margin is defined as revenue less cost of sales. cost of sales includes costs incurred directly by the businesses in the ordinary course of business, such as electricity and fuel purchases; o&m costs; depreciation and amortization expense; bad debt expense & recoveries; general administrative & support costs at the businesses; and gains or losses on derivatives associated with the purchase and sale of electricity or fuel.
we define adjusted operating margin as operating margin, adjusted for the impact of noncontrolling interests, excluding
85
unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions.
the gaap measure most comparable to adjusted operating margin is operating margin. we believe that adjusted operating margin better reflects the underlying business performance of the company. factors in this determination include the impact of noncontrolling interests, where aes consolidates the results of a subsidiary that is not wholly-owned by the company, as well as the variability due to unrealized derivatives gains or losses. adjusted operating margin should not be construed as an alternative to operating margin, which is determined in accordance with gaap.
adjusted ptc and adjusted eps - we define adjusted ptc as pretax income from continuing operations attributable to the aes corporation excluding gains or losses due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) gains or losses due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (d) losses due to impairments, and (e) costs due to the early retirement of debt.
adjusted ptc reflects the impact of noncontrolling interests and excludes the items specified in the definition above. in addition to the revenue and cost of sales reflected in operating margin, adjusted ptc includes the other components of our income statement, such as general and administrative expense in the corporate segment, as well as business development costs; interest expense and interest income; other expense and other income; realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses; and net equity in earnings of affiliates.
we define adjusted eps as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) gains or losses due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (d) losses due to impairments, and (e) costs due to the early retirement of debt.
the gaap measure most comparable to adjusted ptc is income from continuing operations attributable to the aes corporation. the gaap measure most comparable to adjusted eps is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. we believe that adjusted ptc and adjusted eps better reflect the underlying business performance of the company and are considered in the company's internal evaluation of financial performance. factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests or retire debt, which affect results in a given period or periods. in addition, for adjusted ptc, earnings before tax represents the business performance of the company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, including the effects of tax planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the company operates. adjusted ptc and adjusted eps should not be construed as alternatives to income from continuing operations attributable to the aes corporation and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which are determined in accordance with gaap.

adjusted ptc decreased $85 million driven by the decrease of $113 million in adjusted operating margin described above and a decrease in the company's share of earnings under the hlbv allocation of noncontrolling interest at buffalo gap, partially offset by ipl due to lower interest expense related to the impact of the sell down and increased afudc, and dpl due to lower interest expense.
proportional free cash flow decreased $55 million, which includes the $113 million decrease in adjusted operating margin as described above as well as a $22 million increase in maintenance and non-recoverable capital expenditures, partially offset by the collection of previously deferred storm costs, a one-time payment in 2014 to terminate an unfavorable coal contract, higher collections and the timing of inventory payments at dpl. cash was also favorably impacted by the timing of collections and payments for energy at ipl as well as a reduction in interest payments.

adjusted ptc increased $5 million driven by net gains of $53 million recognized resulting from the early termination of the ppa and coal supply contract at beaver valley during the first quarter of 2013, largely offset by an increase of $27 million in adjusted operating margin described above as well as an increase in the company's share of earnings under the hlbv allocation of noncontrolling interest at buffalo gap and armenia wind of $13 million and settlements at laurel mountain of $6 million.
proportional free cash flow decreased $43 million driven by the one-time cash receipt in 2013 upon the early termination of the ppa at beaver valley as well as the timing of legal settlements at laurel mountain as described above. additionally, cash was unfavorably impacted by the timing of payments at ipl for energy, maintenance and inventory and a one-time payment at dpl in the fourth quarter of 2014 to terminate an unfavorable coal contract. these unfavorable impacts were partially offset by the $27 million increase in adjusted operating margin as described above, a $51 million reduction in maintenance capital expenditures, primarily at our utility businesses, as well as the timing of fuel payments and a reduction in interest payments at dpl.

adjusted operating margin increased $22 million for the year due to the drivers above, adjusted for the impact of noncontrolling interests. aes owned 71% of gener and chivor prior to sell down effective december 2015 which resulted in ownership of 67%. aes argentina is owned 100%. the alto maipo and cochrane plants under construction are owned 40%.
adjusted ptc increased $61 million, driven by a restructuring of guacolda in chile which increased our equity investment and resulted in additional equity in earnings of $46 million, realized fx gains, lower interest expense at chivor and the increase of $22 million in adjusted operating margin described above. this was partially offset by lower equity earnings at guacolda of $16 million (excluding restructuring impact above) mainly driven by a 2014 gain on sale of a transmission line.
proportional free cash flow increased $48 million, primarily driven by higher vat refunds at cochrane and alto maipo, the timing of non-recurring maintenance collections at alicura, a decrease in interest payments as well as a $17 million net reduction in maintenance and non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures. excluding the $22 million collection delay resulting from the various resolutions passed by the argentine government (as discussed in note 7-financing receivables), adjusted operating margin decreased by $4 million due to the drivers discussed above. additionally, cash flow was negatively impacted by higher tax payments and lower collections from contract customers at chivor as well as a one-time swap termination payment at ventanas.

adjusted operating margin decreased $36 million primarily due to the drivers discussed above, adjusted for the impact of noncontrolling interests. aes owns 16% of eletropaulo, 46% of uruguaiana, 100% of sul and 24% of tietê.
adjusted ptc increased $30 million, driven by the reversal of a loss contingency resulting from a change in estimate related to interest expense of $47 million and 2014 municipalities settlement interest of $12 million at sul, partially offset by the decrease of $36 million in adjusted operating margin described above, and higher interest rates and debt.
proportional free cash flow decreased $103 million, which includes the $36 million decrease in adjusted operating margin as described above with the exception of the non-recurring 2013 charge related to potential customer refunds as that balance was not fully paid. the brazil sbu was also unfavorably impacted by an increase in tax payments at sul and eletropaulo, the timing of collections of regulatory assets and settlement of regulatory liabilities at eletropaulo and an increase in interest payments at sul as noted above. these decreases were partially offset by a $19 million reduction in maintenance capital expenditures as well as the timing of energy purchases at tietê.

adjusted ptc decreased $25 million, driven by the decrease in adjusted operating margin of $44 million as described above. these results were partially offset by a compensation agreement regarding early termination of the original barge ppa of $10 million and 2014 losses on a legal dispute settlement of $4 million in panama as well as lower interest expense due to lower debt at puerto rico.
proportional free cash flow increased $217 million primarily due to the timing of collections in the dominican republic, puerto rico and panama. these favorable impacts were partially offset by the $44 million decrease in adjusted operating margin as described above as well as a $2 million increase in maintenance and non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures.

adjusted operating margin increased $10 million due to the drivers above adjusted for the impact of noncontrolling interests and excluding unrealized gains and losses on derivatives. aes owns 90% of changuinola and 49% of its other generation facilities in panama, 100% of andres and los mina and 50% of itabo in the dominican republic, 99% of teg/tep and 55% of merida in mexico, and a weighted average of 75% of its businesses in el salvador.
adjusted ptc increased $13 million, driven by the increase in adjusted operating margin of $10 million described above.
proportional free cash flow decreased $152 million primarily due to a one-time settlement received in 2013 at the dominican republic resulting from a fuel contract amendment, an increase in tax payments, as well as the timing of energy purchases at panama, partially offset by the $10 million increase in adjusted operating margin as described above.

adjusted operating margin increased $19 million due to the drivers above adjusted for the impact of noncontrolling interests resulting primarily from the sell-down of our ownership in masinloc from 92% to 51% in mid-july 2014. aes also owns 90% of kelanitissa and 51% of mong duong.
adjusted ptc increased $50 million, driven by the increase of $19 million in adjusted operating margin described above, and the additional net impact of $28 million at mong duong due to a component of service concession revenue recognized as interest income, net of higher interest expense as interest is no longer capitalized. see note 1-general and summary of significant accounting policies in part ii.-item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data for further information regarding the accounting for service concession arrangements.
proportional free cash flow increased $5 million, driven by the collection of service concession revenue at mong duong noted above (which is not included in operating margin) as well as the $19 million increase in adjusted operating margin, but excluding the retrospective adjustment to energy prices as described above. these favorable drivers were partially offset by the timing of collections at masinloc which were negatively impacted by our sell-down of ownership interest in 2014.

adjusted operating margin decreased $108 million due to the drivers above adjusted for the impact of noncontrolling interests and excluding unrealized gains on derivatives. aes owned 92% of masinloc until july 2014 when aes reduced its ownership to 51%.
adjusted ptc decreased $96 million, driven by the decrease of $108 million in adjusted operating margin described above, partially offset by the impact of lower proportional interest expense at masinloc and gains on foreign currency.
proportional free cash flow decreased $19 million, which includes the $108 million decrease in adjusted operating margin as described above, excluding the retrospective adjustment to energy prices, partially offset by the timing of collections and payments for coal at masinloc as well as a decrease in payments for interest and taxes.
key trends and uncertainties during 2016 and beyond, we expect to face the following challenges at certain of our businesses. management expects that improved operating performance at certain businesses, growth from new businesses and global cost reduction initiatives may lessen or offset their impact. if these favorable effects do not occur, or if the challenges described below and elsewhere in this section impact us more significantly than we currently anticipate, or if volatile foreign currencies and commodities move more unfavorably, then these adverse factors (or other adverse factors unknown to us) may impact our operating margin, net income attributable to the aes corporation and cash flows. we continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. for the risk factors related to our business, see item 1.-business and item 1a.-risk factors of this form 10-k.
operational sensitivity to dry hydrological conditions - our hydroelectric generation facilities are sensitive to changes in the weather, particularly the level of water inflows into generation facilities. since 2013, dry hydrological conditions in panama, brazil, colombia and chile have presented challenges for our businesses in these markets. low rainfall and water inflows have caused reservoir levels to be below historical levels, reduced generation output, and increased prices for electricity. if hydrological conditions do not improve and our hydroelectric generation facilities cannot generate sufficient energy to meet contractual arrangements, we may need to purchase energy to fulfill our obligations, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ("noaa") a strong el niño has been declared and is forecasted through the spring of 2016. according to local hydrological forecasts in panama, below historical average inflows are expected to persist through the dry season of 2016 (ending in april). the effects of the el niño phenomena could potentially intensify the dry hydrology conditions during this period. aes panama has to purchase energy on the spot market to fulfill its contract obligations when its generation output is below contract levels. however, with declines in oil prices the cost of purchasing replacement power is reduced. in addition, lower hydrology results in less energy available to sell in the spot market after fulfilling contract obligations. we expect this trend to continue through the dry season of 2016, which will continue to impact our results of operations.
the el niño brought some relief to the dry conditions in brazil as it brought rain to the south and southeast regions. the southeast region has a significant portion of the country's reservoir capacity. at the beginning of 2016, we expect the system operator in brazil to continue to pursue a more conservative reservoir management strategy to recover the reservoirs. higher inflows are expected along with an impact on reservoir level recovery and lower spot prices. aes sul, which is in the south of brazil, could be negatively impacted by higher hydrology causing floods and other damage which could disrupt service and require emergency repairs. additionally, higher hydrology could reduce the need for demand to provide irrigation services during the warm season.
impacts in colombia are uncertain since it will depend strongly upon the behavior pattern of the el niño and can lead to better hydrology for just the area where our plant, chivor, is located or the country as a whole. more extreme behavior can have an opposite impact and leave the chivor basin dryer but the remainder of the country with better hydrology.
in the case of chile, the hydrological year starts in april, and given that the el niño phenomenon is not highly correlated with hydrological conditions in chile, projection are made considering the average of all hydrological conditions. for the first quarter 2016, projections are made considering 2015 snowpack information which shows hydrological condition lower than average.
the exact behavior pattern and strength of el niño cannot be definitively known at this time and therefore the impacts could vary from those described above. even if rainfall and water inflows return to historical averages, in some cases high market prices and low generation could persist until reservoir levels are fully recovered.
macroeconomic and political during the past few years, economic conditions in some countries where our subsidiaries conduct business have deteriorated. global economic conditions remain volatile and could have an adverse impact on our businesses in the event these
96
recent trends continue.
brazil - in brazil, economic conditions remain unfavorable, as indicated by such factors as a negative gdp growth for 2015 and expectation for the same in 2016 and flat for 2017, higher interest rates and inflation, and increasing unemployment. as a consequence, our distribution businesses have experienced a decline in demand. if these economic conditions persist or worsen, there could be a material impact on our businesses and aes's results of operations, particularly in our distribution businesses in brazil, aes sul and aes eletropaulo.
in the case of aes sul, at december 31, 2015, debt in the amount of $333 million is classified as current due to a failure to meet required debt covenants related to earnings for two consecutive quarters. this default is primarily due to the economic conditions noted above, an increase in regulatory assets due to sector charges and higher priced energy purchases, increase in delinquency rates, and higher costs due to unfavorable hydrology in brazil and severe weather conditions, particularly in aes sul's service area. aes sul is in negotiations with its creditors and has obtained a waiver for a period of two months, that ends in february 2016, when the company expects to close the renegotiation of the whole debt, involving extending the debt maturities and additional equity contributions of approximately $75 million. following the debt renegotiations, the company will assess all strategic alternatives for aes sul. if the negotiation is unsuccessful, we may face a loss of earnings and/or cash flows from sul and may have to provide loans or equity to support the business, and/or restructure the business, any of which could have a material impact on the company. in addition, aes sul has recorded net deferred tax assets ("dta") of $133 million relating primarily to net operating loss carryforwards, which are not subject to expiration. realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income. although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that all of the dta will be realized. the amount of dta that is considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced.
argentina - in november 2015, argentina held presidential elections in which centrist candidate mauricio macri was elected president. during his campaign, mauricio macri emphasized that energy would be a key factor in the government's agenda and that a long-term state policy would be required to address the country's energy crisis. also, the elected president signed, together with the opposition candidates, a statement of commitment addressed to the previous administration, that included several guidelines to reactivate the sector including the implementation of a strategic long-term energy plan, that a fair and reasonable customer tariffs be set for generation, transport and distribution costs, as well as reductions in subsidies and the introduction of a social tariff.
in line with these statements, the energy and mining minister published resolution 6/2016 and 7/2016 in january 2016 that outlines planned increases to the end consumers of energy that will be effective starting on february 1, 2016. these resolutions contemplate an increase in tariffs of up to 300% for energy pass-through, grant distribution value added ("dva") increases for distribution companies, provide a regulatory framework for an integral tariff review and introduce subsidies for low income consumers. these increases are intended to lessen the burden on the government to subsidize the energy industry.
in 2001, argentina defaulted on its public debt, when it stopped making payments of approximately $100 billion of debt amid a deep economic crisis. in 2005 and 2010, argentina restructured its defaulted bonds into new securities valued at about 33 cents on the dollar. between the two transactions, 93% of the bondholders agreed to exchange their defaulted bonds for new bonds. the remaining 7% did not accept the restructured deal. since then, a certain group of the "hold-out" bondholders have been in judicial proceedings with argentina regarding payment and the u.s. district court ruled that argentina would need to make payments to such hold-out bondholders according to the original applicable terms. despite intense negotiations with the hold-out bondholders through the u.s. district court appointed special master, on july 30, 2014 the parties failed to reach a settlement agreement and consequently (as referred by s&p and fitch ratings) argentina fell into a selective default resulting from failure to make interest payments on its discount bonds maturing in december 2033. the new administration started conversations to negotiate a solution with the bondholders which could resolve this situation and let argentina return to the credit markets in the near future. although this situation remains unresolved, it has not caused any significant changes that impact our current exposures, and the long-term receivables in argentina for the plants that commenced commercial operations in 2010 are being actively collected. for further information, see note 7-financing receivables in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of the 2015 form 10-k.
bulgaria - our investments in bulgaria rely on long-term ppas with nek, the state-owned electricity public supplier and energy trading company. nek is facing some liquidity issues and has been delayed in making payments under the ppas with maritza and st. nikola. in august 2015, the ninth amendment of maritza's ppa was executed under which maritza and nek would reduce the capacity payment to maritza under the ppa by 14% through the ppa term, without impacting the energy price component. in exchange, nek would pay maritza its overdue receivables. the amendment will become effective upon full payment of the overdue receivables by nek, which is expected in 2016. for the period october through december 2015, nek paid a total of $64 million, which is $16 million more than payments received in the previous year. as of december 31, 2015, maritza's total outstanding receivables were $351 million, of which $44 million were current and $307 million were overdue. total receivables increased by $89 million from $262 million in december 31, 2014. see additional background within part i.-item 1-business-our organization and segments-europe-bulgaria-regulatory framework.
97
as of june 30, 2015, we concluded that the hta signed with nek in april is considered an indicator of an impairment of the long-lived assets in bulgaria for maritza. therefore, a test of recoverability was performed and management believes the carrying amount of the asset groups was recoverable as of june 30, 2015. management does not believe that an indicator of an impairment existed as of december 31, 2015. as of december 31, 2015, maritza had long-lived assets of $1.2 billion and total debt of $559 million. long-lived assets for st. nikola were $210 million and total debt of $140 million.
unless and until a complete and binding resolution is in place, there remains a risk that we may still face a loss of earnings and/or cash flows from the affected businesses (or be unable to exercise remedies for a breach of the ppa) and may have to provide loans or equity to support affected businesses or projects, restructure them, write down their value and/or face the possibility that these projects cannot continue operations or provide returns consistent with our expectations, any of which could have a material impact on the company.
puerto rico - our subsidiaries in puerto rico have long term ppas with prepa, a state-owned entity. due to the ongoing economic situation in the country, prepa faces significant financial challenges.
on june 28, 2014, the puerto rico public corporation debt enforcement and recovery act (the "recovery act") was signed into law, which allows public corporations, including prepa, to adjust their debts. as a result of this event, on july 6, 2014, prepa entered into a forbearance agreement with its lenders in order to permit an opportunity for negotiation of a possible financial restructuring of prepa. in february 2015, the negotiating position of prepa was weakened when the federal court deemed the recovery act unconstitutional. despite this setback, prepa managed to extend the expiration of the forbearance agreement several times, achieving in december of 2015 certain preliminary restructuring agreements, called restructuring support agreements ("rsas"), with most of the bondholders and bank lenders, which involved reductions of capital and interest rates and options to either convert existing credits to term loans or to exchange their principal for new securitized bonds. the rsa is conditional to a series of future related milestones, the more important being the passing of a bill that would allow an increase in tariffs.
there has been no adverse impacts to aes puerto rico due to prepa's financial challenges. aes puerto rico's receivables balance as of december 31, 2015 is $65 million, of which $21 million was overdue. subsequent to december 31, 2015, the full overdue amount has been collected. if the situation declines, there could be a material impact on the company.
macroeconomic and political - conclusion if economic conditions deteriorate further, it could affect the prices we receive for the electricity we generate or transmit. utility regulators or parties to our generation contracts may seek to lower our prices based on prevailing market conditions pursuant to ppas, concession agreements or other contracts as they come up for renewal or reset. in addition, rising fuel and other costs coupled with contractual price or tariff decreases could restrict our ability to operate profitably in a given market. each of these factors, as well as those discussed above, could result in a decline in the value of our assets including those at the businesses we operate, our equity investments and projects under development and could result in asset impairments that could be material to our operations. we continue to monitor our projects and businesses.
foreign exchange and commodities our businesses are exposed to and proactively manage market risk. our primary market risk exposure is to the price of commodities, particularly electricity, oil, natural gas, coal and environmental credits. in 2015, there were more than 40% declines in oil and natural gas prices, which have an impact on our businesses in the dominican republic, ohio and northern ireland. since we operate in multiple countries and as such are subject to volatility in exchange rates at varying degrees at the subsidiary level and between our functional currency, the u.s. dollar, and currencies of the countries in which we operate. in 2015, we had significant devaluations in the argentine peso, brazilian real, colombian peso, and kazakhstan tenge, which had a significant impact on our 2015 results. in 2016, our results could be materially impacted if the u.s. dollar continues to appreciate. for additional information, refer to item 7a.-quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
impairments long-lived assets - during the year ended december 31, 2015, the company recognized asset impairments of $285 million. see note 21-asset impairment expense in this form 10-k for further information.
additionally, in the third quarter of 2015, the company tested the recoverability of its long-lived assets at ballylumford in northern ireland and buffalo gap i and ii. impairment indicators were identified at ballylumford, primarily based on an unfavorable capacity reduction proposed by the utility regulator in northern ireland, and at buffalo gap, based on a decline in forward power curves coupled with the near term expiration of favorable contracted cash flows. as of september 30, 2015, the company determined that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset groups at ballylumford and buffalo gap i and ii, which totaled $92 million and $371 million, respectively, were recoverable, and no impairment expense was recognized. buffalo gap
98
i and ii have ppas that will expire at the end of 2021 and 2017, respectively. once the ppas expire, the entire installed capacity of buffalo gap will be exposed to the volatility of energy prices in the ercot market which could adversely affect revenues. no impairment indicators were identified in the fourth quarter of 2015.
events or changes in circumstances that may necessitate further recoverability tests and potential impairments of long-lived assets may include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased competition due to additional capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, or an expectation that it is more likely than not that the asset will be disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life.
goodwill - during 2015, the company recognized total goodwill impairment expense of $317 million, which resulted from the annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2015 at its dp&l reporting unit ("dp&l"). as of december 31, 2015, there was no remaining goodwill balance at dp&l. see note 10-goodwill and other intangible assets in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data for further information.
the company currently has no reporting units considered to be "at risk." a reporting unit is considered "at risk" when its fair value is not higher than its carrying amount by more than 10%. the company monitors its reporting units at risk of step 1 failure on an ongoing basis. it is possible that the company may incur goodwill impairment charges at any reporting units containing goodwill in future periods if adverse changes in their business or operating environments occur.
capital resources and liquidity overview - as of december 31, 2015, the company had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion, of which $400 million was held at the parent company and qualified holding companies. the company also had $484 million in short term investments, held primarily at subsidiaries. in addition, we had restricted cash and debt service reserves of $860 million. the company also had non-recourse and recourse aggregate principal amounts of debt outstanding of $15.8 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively. of the approximately $2.5 billion of our current non-recourse debt, $1.5 billion was presented as such because it is due in the next twelve months and $1.0 billion relates to debt considered in default due to covenant violations. the defaults are not payment defaults, but are instead technical defaults triggered by failure to comply with other covenants and/or other conditions such as (but not limited to) failure to meet information covenants, complete construction or other milestones in an allocated time, meet certain minimum or maximum financial ratios, or other requirements contained in the non-recourse debt documents of the company.
we expect such current maturities will be repaid from net cash provided by operating activities of the subsidiary to which the debt relates or through opportunistic refinancing activity or some combination thereof. none of our recourse debt matures within the next twelve months. from time to time, we may elect to repurchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise when management believes that such securities are attractively priced. such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements and other factors. the amounts involved in any such repurchases may be material.
we rely mainly on long-term debt obligations to fund our construction activities. we have, to the extent available at acceptable terms, utilized non-recourse debt to fund a significant portion of the capital expenditures and investments required to construct and acquire our electric power plants, distribution companies and related assets. our non-recourse financing is designed to limit cross default risk to the parent company or other subsidiaries and affiliates. our non-recourse long-term debt is a combination of fixed and variable interest rate instruments. generally, a portion or all of the variable rate debt is fixed through the use of interest rate swaps. in addition, the debt is typically denominated in the currency that matches the currency of the revenue expected to be generated from the benefiting project, thereby reducing currency risk. in certain cases, the currency is matched through the use of derivative instruments. the majority of our non-recourse debt is funded by international commercial banks, with debt capacity supplemented by multilaterals and local regional banks.
given our long-term debt obligations, the company is subject to interest rate risk on debt balances that accrue interest at variable rates. when possible, the company will borrow funds at fixed interest rates or hedge its variable rate debt to fix its interest costs on such obligations. in addition, the company has historically tried to maintain at least 70% of its consolidated long-term obligations at fixed interest rates, including fixing the interest rate through the use of interest rate swaps. these efforts apply to the notional amount of the swaps compared to the amount of related underlying debt. presently, the parent company's only material un-hedged exposure to variable interest rate debt relates to indebtedness under its senior secured credit facility and floating rate senior unsecured notes due 2019. on a consolidated basis, of the company's $15.8 billion of total non-recourse debt outstanding as of december 31, 2015, approximately $3.8 billion bore interest at variable rates that were not subject to a derivative instrument which fixed the interest rate.
in addition to utilizing non-recourse debt at a subsidiary level when available, the parent company provides a portion, or in certain instances all, of the remaining long-term financing or credit required to fund development, construction or acquisition of a particular project. these investments have generally taken the form of equity investments or intercompany loans, which are subordinated to the project's non-recourse loans. we generally obtain the funds for these investments from our cash flows from operations, proceeds from the sales of assets and/or the proceeds from our issuances of debt, common stock and other securities. similarly, in certain of our businesses, the parent company may provide financial guarantees or other credit support for the benefit of counterparties who have entered into contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity, equipment or other services with our subsidiaries or lenders. in such circumstances, if a business defaults on its payment or supply obligation, the parent company will be responsible for the business' obligations up to the amount provided for in the relevant guarantee or other credit support. at december 31, 2015, the parent company had provided outstanding financial and performance-related guarantees or other credit support commitments to or for the benefit of our businesses, which were limited by the terms of the agreements, of approximately $396 million in aggregate (excluding those collateralized by letters of credit and other obligations discussed below).
as a result of the parent company's below investment grade rating, counterparties may be unwilling to accept our general unsecured commitments to provide credit support. accordingly, with respect to both new and existing commitments, the parent company may be required to provide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of credit, to backstop or replace our credit support. the parent company may not be able to provide adequate assurances to such counterparties. to the extent we are required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such counterparties, this will reduce the amount of credit available to us to meet our other liquidity needs. at december 31, 2015, we had $62 million in letters of credit outstanding, provided under our senior secured credit facility, and $32 million in cash collateralized letters of credit outstanding outside of
99
our senior secured credit facility. these letters of credit operate to guarantee performance relating to certain project development activities and business operations. during the year ended december 31, 2015, the company paid letter of credit fees ranging from 0.2% to 2.5% per annum on the outstanding amounts.
we expect to continue to seek, where possible, non-recourse debt financing in connection with the assets or businesses that we or our affiliates may develop, construct or acquire. however, depending on local and global market conditions and the unique characteristics of individual businesses, non-recourse debt may not be available on economically attractive terms or at all. if we decide not to provide any additional funding or credit support to a subsidiary project that is under construction or has near-term debt payment obligations and that subsidiary is unable to obtain additional non-recourse debt, such subsidiary may become insolvent, and we may lose our investment in that subsidiary. additionally, if any of our subsidiaries lose a significant customer, the subsidiary may need to withdraw from a project or restructure the non-recourse debt financing. if we or the subsidiary choose not to proceed with a project or are unable to successfully complete a restructuring of the non-recourse debt, we may lose our investment in that subsidiary.
many of our subsidiaries depend on timely and continued access to capital markets to manage their liquidity needs. the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, to refinance existing indebtedness or to fund operations and other commitments during times of political or economic uncertainty may have material adverse effects on the financial condition and results of operations of those subsidiaries. in addition, changes in the timing of tariff increases or delays in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions could affect the cash flows and results of operations of our businesses.
long-term receivables - as of december 31, 2015, the company had approximately $296 million and $63 million of accounts receivable classified as noncurrent assets-other and current assets-accounts receivable, respectively, related to certain of its generation businesses in argentina and the u.s. and its utility businesses in brazil. the noncurrent portion primarily consists of accounts receivable in argentina that, pursuant to amended agreements or government resolutions, have collection periods that extend beyond december 31, 2016, or one year from the latest balance sheet date. the majority of argentinian receivables have been converted into long-term financing for the construction of power plants. see note 7-financing receivables included in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data and item 1.-business-regulatory matters-argentina of this form 10-k for further information.
consolidated cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 cash and cash equivalents decreased $277 million and $103 million, respectively. the table below reflects the changes in cash flows for the comparative periods (in millions).

proportional free cash flow (a non-gaap measure)
we define proportional free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less maintenance capital expenditures (including non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures), adjusted for the estimated impact of noncontrolling interests. the proportionate share of cash flows and related adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries comprise the proportional adjustment factor presented in the reconciliation below. upon the company's adoption of the accounting guidance for service concession arrangements effective january 1, 2015, capital expenditures related to service concession assets that would have been classified as investing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows are now classified as operating activities. see note 1-general and summary of significant accounting policies of this form 10-k for further information on the adoption of this guidance.
beginning in the quarter ended march 31, 2015, the company changed the definition of proportional free cash flow to exclude the cash flows for capital expenditures related to service concession assets that are now classified within net cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows. the proportional adjustment factor for these capital expenditures is presented in the reconciliation below.
we also exclude environmental capital expenditures that are expected to be recovered through regulatory, contractual or other mechanisms. an example of recoverable environmental capital expenditures is ipl's investment in mats-related environmental upgrades that are recovered through a tracker. see item 1.-us sbu-ipl-environmental matters for details of these investments.
the gaap measure most comparable to proportional free cash flow is cash flows from operating activities. we believe that proportional free cash flow better reflects the underlying business performance of the company, as it measures the cash generated by the business, after the funding of maintenance capital expenditures, that may be available for investing or repaying debt or other purposes. factors in this determination include the impact of noncontrolling interests, where aes consolidates the results of a subsidiary that is not wholly-owned by the company.
the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations. proportional free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to cash from operating activities, which is determined in accordance with gaap. proportional free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary payments because it excludes certain payments that are required or to which we have committed, such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. our definition of proportional free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

(1)   service concession asset expenditures excluded from proportional free cash flow non-gaap metric.
(2)   the proportional adjustment factor, proportional maintenance capital expenditures (net of reinsurance proceeds) and proportional non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures are calculated by multiplying the percentage owned by noncontrolling interests for each entity by its corresponding consolidated cash flow metric and are totaled to the resulting figures. for example, parent company a owns 20% of subsidiary company b, a consolidated subsidiary. thus, subsidiary company b has an 80% noncontrolling interest. assuming a consolidated net cash flow from operating activities of $100 from subsidiary b, the proportional adjustment factor for subsidiary b would equal $80 (or $100 x 80%). the company calculates the proportional adjustment factor for each consolidated business in this manner and then sums these amounts to determine the total proportional adjustment factor used in the reconciliation. the proportional adjustment factor may differ from the proportion of income attributable to noncontrolling interests as a result of (a) non-cash items which impact income but not cash and (b) aes' ownership interest in the subsidiary where such items occur.
(3)   includes proportional adjustment amount for service concession asset expenditures of $84 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 . the company adopted service concession accounting effective january 1, 2015.
(4)   excludes ipl's proportional recoverable environmental capital expenditures of $205 million, $163 million and $110 million for the years december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

proportional free cash flow for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014 increased $136 million, due to the drivers above as well as an $23 million reduction in maintenance capital expenditures.
fiscal year 2014 versus 2013
operating cash flow for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 increased $114 million, driven primarily by the following business drivers (in millions):

proportional free cash flow for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013 increased $97 million, due to the drivers above, partially offset by a $17 million increase in maintenance capital expenditures.
parent free cash flow (a non-gaap measure)
the company defines parent free cash flow as dividends and other distributions received from our operating businesses less certain cash costs at the parent company level, primarily interest payments, overhead, and development costs. parent free cash flow is used to fund shareholder dividends, share repurchases, growth investments, recourse debt repayments, and other uses by the parent company. refer to item 1-business-overview for further discussion of the parent company's capital allocation strategy.
parent company liquidity the following discussion of parent company liquidity has been included because we believe it is a useful measure of the liquidity available to the aes corporation, or the parent company, given the non-recourse nature of most of our indebtedness. parent company liquidity as outlined below is a non-gaap measure and should not be construed as an alternative to cash and cash equivalents which are determined in accordance with gaap, as a measure of liquidity. cash and cash equivalents are disclosed in the consolidated statements of cash flows. parent company liquidity may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. the principal sources of liquidity at the parent company level are dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries, including refinancing proceeds; proceeds from debt and equity financings at the parent company level, including availability under our credit facility; and proceeds from asset sales. cash requirements at the parent company level are primarily to fund interest; principal repayments of debt; construction commitments; other equity commitments; common stock repurchases; acquisitions; taxes; parent company overhead and development costs; and dividends on common stock.

the company defines parent company liquidity as cash available to the parent company plus available borrowings under existing credit facility. the cash held at qualified holding companies represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the company domiciled outside of the u.s.. such subsidiaries have no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to the parent company. parent company liquidity is reconciled to its most directly comparable u.s. gaap financial measure, cash and cash equivalents, at december 31, 2015 and 2014 as follows:

the company paid dividends of $0.40 per share to its common stockholders during the year ended december 31, 2015. while we intend to continue payment of dividends and believe we will have sufficient liquidity to do so, we can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends, or if continued, the amount of such dividends.
recourse debt - our recourse debt at year-end was approximately $5.0 billion and $5.3 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively. see note 12-debt in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for additional detail.
while we believe that our sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future, this belief is based on a number of material assumptions, including, without limitation, assumptions about our ability to access the capital markets (see key trends and uncertainties-global economic conditions), the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, currency exchange rates, power market pool prices, and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. in addition, our subsidiaries' ability to declare and pay cash dividends to us (at the parent company level) is subject to certain limitations contained in loans, governmental provisions and other agreements. we can provide no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that the actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated. see item 1a.-risk factors-the aes corporation is a holding company and its ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness, including its public debt securities, is dependent upon the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries by way of dividends, fees, interest, loans or otherwise, of this form 10-k.
various debt instruments at the parent company level, including our senior secured credit facility, contain certain restrictive covenants. the covenants provide for - among other items - limitations on other indebtedness, liens, investments and guarantees; limitations on dividends, stock repurchases and other equity transactions; restrictions and limitations on mergers and acquisitions, sales of assets, leases, transactions with affiliates and off-balance sheet and derivative arrangements; maintenance of certain financial ratios; and financial and other reporting requirements.
as of december 31, 2015, we were in compliance with these covenants at the parent company level.
non-recourse debt - while the lenders under our non-recourse debt financings generally do not have direct recourse to the parent company, defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for our results of operations and liquidity, including, without limitation:
•   reducing our cash flows as the subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the parent company during the time period of any default;
•   triggering our obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support we have provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary;
•   causing us to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets; and
•   triggering defaults in our outstanding debt at the parent company.
for example, our senior secured credit facility and outstanding debt securities at the parent company include events of default for certain bankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries. in addition, our revolving credit agreement at the parent company includes events of default related to payment defaults and accelerations of outstanding debt of material subsidiaries.
some of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. the total non-recourse debt classified as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets amounts to $2.5 billion. the portion of current debt related to such defaults was $1.0 billion at december 31, 2015, all of which was non-recourse debt related to four subsidiaries - maritza, sul, kavarna, and sogrinsk. see note 12-debt in item 8.-financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10-k for additional detail.
none of the subsidiaries that are currently in default are subsidiaries that met the applicable definition of materiality under aes' corporate debt agreements as of december 31, 2015 in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under aes' indebtedness. however, as a result of additional dispositions of assets, other significant reductions in asset carrying values or other matters in the future that may impact our financial position and results of operations or the financial position of the individual subsidiary, it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries could fall within the definition of a "material subsidiary" and thereby upon an acceleration trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under the parent company's outstanding debt securities. a material subsidiary is defined in the company's senior secured revolving credit facility as any business that contributed 20% or more of the parent company's total cash distributions from businesses for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters. as of december 31, 2015, none of the defaults listed above individually or in the aggregate results in or is at risk of triggering a cross-default under the recourse debt of the company.

(1) excludes normal and customary representations and warranties in agreements for the sale of assets (including ownership in associated legal entities) where the associated risk is considered to be nominal.
as of december 31, 2015, the company had no commitments to invest in subsidiaries under construction and to purchase related equipment that were not included in the letters of credit disclosed above.
we have a diverse portfolio of performance-related contingent contractual obligations. these obligations are designed to cover potential risks and only require payment if certain targets are not met or certain contingencies occur. the risks associated with these obligations include change of control, construction cost overruns, subsidiary default, political risk, tax indemnities, spot market power prices, sponsor support and liquidated damages under power sales agreements for projects in development, in operation and under construction. in addition, we have an asset sale program through which we may have customary indemnity obligations under certain assets sale agreements. while we do not expect that we will be required to fund any material amounts under these contingent contractual obligations beyond 2015, many of the events which would give rise to such obligations are beyond our control. we can provide no assurance that we will be able to fund our obligations under these contingent contractual obligations if we are required to make substantial payments thereunder.

critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements of aes are prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. aes' significant accounting policies are described in note 1-general and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10-k.
an accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.
management believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could materially differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee, as appropriate. listed below are the company's most significant critical accounting estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
income taxes - we are subject to income taxes in both the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our worldwide income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities. the company and certain of its subsidiaries are under examination by relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. the company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each tax jurisdiction when determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes. accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold. tax reserves have been established, which the company believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. once established, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. while the company believes that the amounts of the tax estimates are reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may be materially different than the reserve amounts.
because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, any changes in our geographical earnings mix could materially impact our effective tax rate. furthermore, our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof and such changes may be more likely or become more likely in view of recent economic trends in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate. as an example, new tax laws were enacted in february 2016 in chile which will increase the statutory income tax rate for most of our chilean businesses from 25% to 25.5% in 2017 and to 27% for 2018 and future years. accordingly, in 2016 our net chilean deferred tax liabilities will be remeasured to the new rates. the remeasurement amount and other potential future impacts of the changes in tax law may be material to continuing operations.
the company's provision for income taxes could be adversely impacted by changes to the u.s. taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. since 2006, the company has benefited from the controlled foreign corporation look-through rule, originally enacted in the tipra of 2005, subject to five temporary extensions, including the most recent five year retroactive extension enacted on december 18, 2015 in the h.r.2029 - consolidated appropriations act, 2016. there can be no assurance that this provision will continue to be extended beyond december 31, 2019. further, the u.s. is considering corporate tax reform that may significantly change the u.s. international tax rules and corporate tax rates. our expected effective tax rate could increase by amounts that may be material to the company should such reforms be enacted.
in addition, u.s. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain of our non-u.s. subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries.
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of the existing assets and liabilities, and their respective income tax bases. the company establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.
sales of noncontrolling interests - the accounting for a sale of noncontrolling interests under the accounting standards depends on whether the sale is considered to be a sale of in-substance real estate (as opposed to an equity transaction), where the gain (loss) on sale would be recognized in earnings rather than within stockholders' equity. if management's estimation process determines that there is no significant value beyond the in-substance real estate, the gain (loss) on the sale of the noncontrolling interest is recognized in earnings. however, if it is determined that significant value likely exists beyond the in-substance real estate, the gain (loss) on the sale of the noncontrolling interest would be recognized within stockholders' equity. in-substance real estate is comprised of land plus improvements and integral equipment. the determination of whether property, plant and equipment is integral equipment is based on the significance of the costs to remove the equipment from its existing location (including the cost of repairing damage resulting from the removal), combined with the decrease in the fair
113
value of the equipment as a result of those removal activities. when the combined total of removal costs and the decrease in fair value of the equipment exceeds 10% of the fair value of the equipment, the equipment is considered integral equipment. the accounting standards specifically identify power plants as an example of in-substance real estate. where the consolidated entity in which noncontrolling interests have been sold contains in-substance real estate, management estimates the extent to which the total fair value of the assets of the entity is represented by the in-substance real estate and whether significant value exists beyond the in-substance real estate. this estimation considers all qualitative and quantitative factors relevant for each sale and, where appropriate, includes making quantitative estimates about the fair value of the entity and its identifiable assets and liabilities (including any favorable or unfavorable contracts) by analogy to the accounting standards on business combinations. as such, these estimates may require significant judgment and assumptions, similar to the critical accounting estimates discussed below for impairments and fair value.
impairments - our accounting policies on goodwill and long-lived assets are described in detail in note 1-general and summary of significant accounting policies, included in item 8 of this form 10-k. the company makes considerable judgments in its impairment evaluations of goodwill and long-lived assets; however, the fair value determination is typically the most judgmental part in an impairment evaluation.
the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit or a long-lived asset (asset group) by applying the approaches prescribed under the fair value measurement accounting framework. generally, the market approach and income approach are most relevant in the fair value measurement of our reporting units and long-lived assets; however, due to the lack of available relevant observable market information in many circumstances, the company often relies on the income approach. the company may engage an independent valuation firm to assist management with the valuation. the decision to engage an independent valuation firm considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including a cost-benefit analysis and the company's internal valuation knowledge of the long-lived asset (asset group) or business. the company develops the underlying assumptions consistent with its internal budgets and forecasts for such valuations. additionally, the company uses an internal discounted cash flow valuation model (the "dcf model"), based on the principles of present value techniques, to estimate the fair value of its reporting units or long-lived assets under the income approach. the dcf model estimates fair value by discounting our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts, adjusted to reflect market participant assumptions, to the extent necessary, at an appropriate discount rate.
management applies considerable judgment in selecting several input assumptions during the development of our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts. examples of the input assumptions that our budgets and forecasts are sensitive to include macroeconomic factors such as growth rates, industry demand, inflation, exchange rates, power prices and commodity prices. whenever appropriate, management obtains these input assumptions from observable market data sources (e.g., economic intelligence unit) and extrapolates the market information if an input assumption is not observable for the entire forecast period. many of these input assumptions are dependent on other economic assumptions, which are often derived from statistical economic models with inherent limitations such as estimation differences. further, several input assumptions are based on historical trends which often do not recur. the input assumptions most significant to our budgets and cash flows are based on expectations of macroeconomic factors which have been volatile recently. it is not uncommon that different market data sources have different views of the macroeconomic factor expectations and related assumptions. as a result, macroeconomic factors and related assumptions are often available in a narrow range; however, in some situations these ranges become wide and the use of a different set of input assumptions could produce significantly different budgets and cash flow forecasts.
a considerable amount of judgment is also applied in the estimation of the discount rate used in the dcf model. to the extent practical, inputs to the discount rate are obtained from market data sources (e.g., bloomberg, capital iq, etc.). the company selects and uses a set of publicly traded companies from the relevant industry to estimate the discount rate inputs. management applies judgment in the selection of such companies based on its view of the most likely market participants. it is reasonably possible that the selection of a different set of likely market participants could produce different input assumptions and result in the use of a different discount rate.
fair value of a reporting unit or a long-lived asset (asset group) is sensitive to both input assumptions to our budgets and cash flow forecasts and the discount rate. further, estimates of long-term growth and terminal value are often critical to the fair value determination. as part of the impairment evaluation process, management analyzes the sensitivity of fair value to various underlying assumptions. the level of scrutiny increases as the gap between fair value and carrying amount decreases. changes in any of these assumptions could result in management reaching a different conclusion regarding the potential impairment, which could be material. our impairment evaluations inherently involve uncertainties from uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions.

fair value fair value hierarchy - the company uses valuation techniques and methodologies that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. where observable prices are not available, valuation models are applied to estimate the fair value using the available observable inputs. the valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments' complexity.
to increase consistency and enhance disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments, the fair value measurement standard includes a fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into three categories. an asset or liability's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement, where level 1 is the highest and level 3 is the lowest. for more information regarding the fair value hierarchy, see note 1-general and summary of significant accounting policies included in item 8 of this form 10-k.
fair value of financial instruments - a significant number of the company's financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. the company makes estimates regarding the valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the consolidated financial statements. these assets and liabilities include short and long-term investments in debt and equity securities, included in the balance sheet line items short-term investments and other assets (noncurrent), derivative assets, included in other current assets and other assets (noncurrent) and derivative liabilities, included in accrued and other liabilities (current) and other long-term liabilities. investments are generally fair valued based on quoted market prices or other observable market data such as interest rate indices. the company's investments are primarily certificates of deposit, government debt securities and money market funds. derivatives are valued using observable data as inputs into internal valuation models. the company's derivatives primarily consist of interest rate swaps, foreign currency instruments, and commodity and embedded derivatives. additional discussion regarding the nature of these financial instruments and valuation techniques can be found in note 4-fair value included in item 8 of this form 10-k.
fair value of nonfinancial assets and liabilities - significant estimates are made in determining the fair value of long-lived tangible and intangible assets (i.e., property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill) during the impairment evaluation process. in addition, the majority of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are required to be recognized at fair value under the relevant accounting guidance. in determining the fair value of these items, management makes several assumptions as discussed in the impairments section above.
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities - we enter into various derivative transactions in order to hedge our exposure to certain market risks. we primarily use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate, commodity and foreign currency exposures. we do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes.
in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value except where derivatives qualify and are designated as "normal purchase/normal sale" transactions. changes in fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met. income and expense related to derivative instruments are recognized in the same category as that generated by the underlying asset or liability. see note 6-derivative instruments and hedging activities included in item 8 of this form 10-k for further information on the classification.
the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging enable companies to designate qualifying derivatives as hedging instruments based on the exposure being hedged. these hedge designations include fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of the exposure being hedged. the company has no fair value hedges at this time. changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated as and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized into earnings as the hedged transactions occur. any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings immediately. for all hedge contracts, the company provides formal documentation of the hedge and effectiveness testing in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging.
the fair value measurement accounting standard provides additional guidance on the definition of fair value and defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or exit price. the fair value measurement standard requires the company to consider and reflect the assumptions of market participants in the fair value calculation. these factors include nonperformance risk (the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled) and credit risk, both of the reporting entity (for liabilities) and of the counterparty (for assets). due to the nature of the company's interest rate swaps, which are typically associated with non-recourse debt, credit risk for aes is evaluated at the subsidiary level rather than at the parent company level. nonperformance

risk on the company's derivative instruments is an adjustment to the initial asset/liability fair value position that is derived from internally developed valuation models that utilize observable market inputs.
as a result of uncertainty, complexity and judgment, accounting estimates related to derivative accounting could result in material changes to our financial statements under different conditions or utilizing different assumptions. as a part of accounting for these derivatives, we make estimates concerning nonperformance, volatilities, market liquidity, future commodity prices, interest rates, credit ratings (both ours and our counterparty's), and future exchange rates. refer to note 4-fair value included in item 8 of this form 10-k for additional details.
the fair value of our derivative portfolio is generally determined using internal valuation models, most of which are based on observable market inputs including interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. the company derives most of its financial instrument market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., bloomberg, reuters and platt's). in some cases, where market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to derive market assumptions to determine a financial instrument's fair value. in certain instances, the published curve may not extend through the remaining term of the contract and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve. specifically, where there is limited forward curve data with respect to foreign exchange contracts, beyond the traded points the company utilizes the purchasing power parity approach to construct the remaining portion of the forward curve using relative inflation rates. additionally, in the absence of quoted prices, we may rely on "indicative pricing" quotes from financial institutions to input into our valuation model for certain of our foreign currency swaps. these indicative pricing quotes do not constitute either a bid or ask price and therefore are not considered observable market data. for individual contracts, the use of different valuation models or assumptions could have a material effect on the calculated fair value.
regulatory assets - management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes, recent rate orders applicable to other regulated entities and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, any asset write-offs would be required to be recognized in operating income.
consolidation - the company has recently entered into several transactions whereby the company sells an interest in its controlled subsidiaries and/or equity method investments. in connection with each transaction, the company must determine whether the sale of the interest impacts the company's consolidation conclusion by first determining whether the transaction should be evaluated under the variable interest model or the voting model. in determining which consolidation model applies to the transaction, the company is required to make judgments about how the entity operates, the most significant of which are whether (i) the entity has sufficient equity to finance its activities, (ii) the equity holders, as a group, have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and (iii) whether the entity has non-substantive voting rights.
if the entity is determined to be a variable interest entity, the most significant judgment in determining whether the company must consolidate the entity is whether the subsidiary, including its related parties and de facto agents, collectively have power and benefits. if aes is determined to have power and benefits, the entity will be consolidated by aes.
alternatively, if the entity is determined to be a voting model entity, the most significant judgments involve determining whether the non-aes shareholders have substantive participating rights. the assessment of shareholder rights and whether they are substantive participating rights requires significant judgment since the rights provided under shareholders' agreements may include selecting, terminating, and setting the compensation of management responsible for implementing the subsidiary's policies and procedures, establishing operating and capital decisions of the entity, including budgets, in the ordinary course of business. on the other hand, if shareholder rights are only protective in nature (referred to as protective rights) then such rights would not overcome the presumption that the owner of a majority voting interest shall consolidate its investee. significant judgment is required to determine whether minority rights represent substantive participating rights or protective rights that do not affect the evaluation of control. while both represent an approval or veto right, a distinguishing factor is the underlying activity or action to which the right relates.
pension and other postretirement plans - effective january 1, 2016 the company will apply a disaggregated discount rate approach for determining service cost and interest cost for its defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement plans in the u.s. and u.k. refer to note 1-general and summary of significant accounting policies included in item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.

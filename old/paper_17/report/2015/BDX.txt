item  1a.    risk factors.
an investment in bd involves a variety of risks and uncertainties. the following describes some of the significant risks that could adversely affect bd's business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.
risks relating to the company global economic conditions could continue to adversely affect our operations.
in recent years, we have been faced with very challenging global economic conditions. deterioration in the global economic environment, particularly in emerging markets and countries with government-sponsored healthcare systems, may result in decreased demand for our products and services, increased competition, downward pressure on the prices for our products, longer sales cycles, and slower adoption of new technologies. a weakening of macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers, which could result in interruptions in supply in the future. we have also previously experienced delays in collecting receivables in certain countries in western europe, and we may experience similar delays in the future in these and other countries or regions experiencing liquidity problems.
we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk.
a substantial amount of our revenues are derived from international operations, and we anticipate that a significant portion of our sales will continue to come from outside the u.s. in the future. the revenues we report with respect to our operations outside the united states may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. a discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we may attempt to address any impact is contained in item 7., management's discussion of financial condition and results of operations. any hedging activities we engage in may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can mitigate these risks.
changes in reimbursement practices of third-party payers could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold.
our sales depend, in part, on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities, private insurers and other third-party payers for the costs of our products. the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of third-party payers, which can vary among public and private sources and by country, may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products in a particular jurisdiction. reimbursement rates can also affect the acceptance rate of new technologies and products. legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the united states or abroad, changes in reimbursement rates by private payers, or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our products or result in denial of reimbursement for those products, which would adversely affect customer demand or the price customers are willing to pay for such products. see "third-party reimbursement" under item 1., business.
federal healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of operations.
the ppaca was enacted in march 2010. the ppaca imposes on medical device manufacturers, such as bd, a 2.3% excise tax on u.s. sales of certain medical devices. we cannot predict with any certainty what other impact the ppaca may have on our business. the ppaca, among other things, reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals, clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies, and could otherwise reduce the volume of medical procedures. these factors, in turn, could result in reduced demand for our products and increased downward pricing pressure. it is also possible that the ppaca will result in lower reimbursement rates for our products. other provisions in the law may significantly change the practice of health care and could adversely affect aspects of our business.
consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income.
the medical technology industry has experienced a significant amount of consolidation. as a result of this consolidation, competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased. health care systems and other health care companies are also consolidating, resulting in greater purchasing power for these companies and competition among medical device suppliers to provide goods and services. group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have also
6
served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers, which has also placed pricing pressure on medical device suppliers. further consolidation in the industry could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products.
cost volatility could adversely affect our operations.
our results of operations could be negatively impacted by volatility in the cost of raw materials, components, freight and energy. in particular, we purchase supplies of resins, which are oil-based components used in the manufacture of certain products. any significant increases in resin costs could adversely impact future operating results. increases in the price of oil can also increase our costs for packaging and transportation. new laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy costs as well as the costs of certain raw materials and components. we may not be able to offset increases in these costs through other cost reductions.
breaches of our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
we rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. our information technology systems have been subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes, and cyber- or phishing- attacks, and we have experienced instances of unauthorized access to our systems in the past. we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future. in addition to our own information, we store certain information with third parties that could be subject to these types of attacks. these attacks could result in our intellectual property and other confidential information being lost or stolen, disruption of our operations, and other negative consequences, such as increased costs for security measures or remediation costs, diversion of management attention, and adverse impact on our relationships with vendors and customers. while we will continue to implement additional protective measures to reduce the risk of and detect future cyber incidents, cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, and the techniques used in such attacks change rapidly. there can be no assurances that our protective measures will prevent future attacks that could have a significant impact on our business.
our future growth is dependent in part upon the development of new products, and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed.
a significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients, healthcare workers and researchers. the development of these products requires significant investment in research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals. the results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to anticipate customer needs, innovate and develop new products, complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the united states and abroad, manufacture products in a cost-effective manner, obtain appropriate intellectual property protection for our products, and gain and maintain market approval of our products. in addition, patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product. there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance.
we cannot guarantee that any of our strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances will be successful.
as part of our strategy to increase revenue growth, we seek to supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. such transactions are inherently risky., and the integration of any newly-acquired business requires significant effort and management attention. the success of any acquisition, investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business. there can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful.
the medical technology industry is very competitive.
we face significant competition from a wide range of companies. these include large medical device companies with multiple product lines, some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do, and firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets or product lines. we face competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold on the basis of product features, clinical outcomes, product quality, price, services and other factors. in addition, we face changing customer preferences and requirements, including increased customer demand for more environmentally-friendly products.
the medical technology industry is also subject to rapid technological change and discovery. the development of new or improved products, processes or technologies by other companies (such as needle-free injection technology) may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive. in some instances, competitors, including pharmaceutical companies, also offer, or are attempting to develop, alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device. the entry into the market of manufacturers located in china and other low-cost manufacturing locations has also created pricing pressure, particularly in developing markets.
7
the international operations of our business may subject us to certain business risks.
a substantial amount of our sales come from our operations outside the united states, and we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in foreign markets, especially in emerging markets. our foreign operations subject us to certain risks, including the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange (discussed above), the effects of local economic conditions, foreign regulatory requirements or changes in such requirements, local product preferences and product requirements, difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing foreign operations, differing labor regulations, changes in tax laws, potential political instability, weakening or loss of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries, import or export licensing requirements, trade protection and restrictions on the transfer of capital across borders. the success of our operations outside the united states depends, in part, on our ability to acquire or form and maintain alliances with local companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to, among other things, our production facilities and sales and distribution networks.
in addition, our international operations are governed by the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar anti-corruption laws outside the u.s. global enforcement of anti-corruption laws has increased substantially in recent years, with more enforcement proceedings by u.s. and foreign governmental agencies and the imposition of significant fines and penalties. while we have implemented policies and procedures to enhance compliance with these laws, our international operations, which often involve customer relationships with foreign governments, create the risk that there may be unauthorized payments or offers of payments by employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors. any alleged or actual violations of these laws may subject us to government investigations, significant criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities, and negatively affect our reputation.
under the u.s. tax code, we may also be subject to additional taxation to the extent we repatriate earnings from our foreign operations to the u.s. in the event we require more capital in the united states than is generated by our u.s. operations to fund acquisitions or other activities and elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions, our effective tax rate may be higher as a result.
reductions in customers' research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our bd biosciences business.
our bd biosciences business sells products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government laboratories and private foundations. research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions. a number of these customers are also dependent for their funding upon grants from u.s. government agencies, such as the u.s. national institutes of health ("nih") and agencies in other countries. the level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable. there have been instances where nih grants have been frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended periods. the availability of governmental research funding may also continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions and governmental spending reductions. any reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products.
a reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials and components would adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales.
we purchase many different types of raw materials and components. certain raw materials and components are not available from multiple sources. in addition, for quality assurance, cost-effectiveness and other reasons, we elect to purchase certain raw materials and components from sole suppliers. the supply of these materials can be disrupted for a number of reasons, including economic conditions as described above. while we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply, no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful. in addition, due to regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers, we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or without excessive cost. the termination, reduction or interruption in supply of these sole-sourced raw materials and components could adversely impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products.
interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income.
we have manufacturing sites all over the world. in some instances, however, the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants. damage to one or more of our facilities from weather or natural disasters, or issues in our manufacturing arising from failure to follow internal protocols and procedures, equipment failure or other factors could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products, resulting in lost revenues and damage to our relationships with customers.
we are subject to lawsuits.
we are or have been a defendant in a number of lawsuits, including purported class action lawsuits for, among other things, alleged antitrust violations and suits alleging patent infringement, and could be subject to additional lawsuits in the future. a more detailed description of these lawsuits is contained in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in

item 7.     management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. within the tables presented throughout this discussion, certain columns may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. percentages and earnings per share amounts presented are calculated from the underlying amounts. references to years throughout this discussion relate to our fiscal years, which end on september 30.
company overview description of the company and business segments becton, dickinson and company ("bd") is a global medical technology company engaged principally in the development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of medical devices, instrument systems and reagents used by healthcare institutions, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, the pharmaceutical industry and the general public. effective october 1, 2014, bd's organizational structure was realigned to better complement its customer-focused solutions strategy and is now based upon two worldwide business segments, bd medical ("medical") and bd life sciences ("life sciences"). the composition of the medical segment was not changed by this realignment and the life sciences segment consists of the former bd diagnostics and bd biosciences segments. the commentary provided further below reflects this two-segment organizational structure and additional discussion regarding this organization realignment is provided in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. carefusion corporation ("carefusion"), which was acquired on march 17, 2015, operates as part of our medical segment, as further discussed below.
bd's products are manufactured and sold worldwide. our products are marketed in the united states and internationally through independent distribution channels and directly to end-users by bd and independent sales representatives. we organize our operations outside the united states as follows: europe, ema (which includes the commonwealth of independent states, the middle east and africa); greater asia (which includes japan and asia pacific); latin america (which includes mexico, central america, the caribbean, and south america) and canada. we continue to pursue growth opportunities in emerging markets, which include the following geographic regions: eastern europe, the middle east, africa, latin america and asia pacific. we are particularly focused on certain countries whose economic and healthcare sectors are growing rapidly, in particular: china, india and turkey.
strategic objectives bd remains focused on delivering sustainable growth and shareholder value, while making appropriate investments for the future. bd management operates the business consistent with the following core strategies:
•   to increase revenue growth by focusing on our core products, services and solutions that deliver greater benefits to patients, healthcare workers and researchers;
•   to increase investment in research and development for platform extensions and innovative new products;
•   to make significant investments in growing our operations in emerging markets;
•   to improve operating effectiveness and balance sheet productivity;
•   to drive an efficient capital structure and strong shareholder returns.
our strategy focuses on four specific areas within healthcare and life sciences:
•   enabling safer, simpler and more effective parenteral drug delivery;
•   improving clinical outcomes through new, more accurate and faster diagnostics;
•   providing tools and technologies to the research community that facilitate the understanding of the cell, cellular diagnostics and cell therapy;
•   enhancing disease management in diabetes, women's health and cancer, and infection control.
we continue to strive to improve the efficiency of our capital structure and follow these guiding principles:
•   to maintain an investment grade rating;
•   to ensure access to the debt market for strategic opportunities;
16
•   to optimize the cost of capital based on market conditions.
in assessing the outcomes of these strategies as well as bd's financial condition and operating performance, management generally reviews quarterly forecast data, monthly actual results, segment sales and other similar information. we also consider trends related to certain key financial data, including gross profit margin, selling and administrative expense, investment in research and development, return on invested capital, and cash flows.
acquisition of carefusion on march 17, 2015, pursuant to a definitive agreement entered into on october 5, 2014, bd acquired a 100% interest in carefusion for total consideration of approximately $12.5 billion to create a global leader in medication management and patient safety solutions. the operating activities of carefusion from the acquisition date through march 31, 2015 were not material to bd's consolidated results of operations and as such, carefusion's operating results were included in bd's consolidated results of operations beginning on april 1, 2015. carefusion operates as part of our medical segment, which now includes the following organizational units, in addition to the diabetes care and pharmaceutical systems units: medication and procedural solutions, which encompasses bd's former medical surgical systems unit; medication management solutions; and respiratory solutions. additional discussion regarding this acquisition is provided in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. disclosures regarding bd's financing arrangements relating to this transaction are provided in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
summary of financial results worldwide revenues in 2015 of $10.282 billion increased 21.7% from the prior year, compared with an increase of 4.9% in 2014. the components of the total worldwide revenue growth in 2015 and 2014 were as follows:
2015 vs. 2014         2014 vs. 2013
carefusion                        24.1        %            -        %
volume                             5.1        %          5.0        %
other acquisitions                   -        %          0.2        %
price (including product mix)        -        %            -        %
foreign exchange translation      (7.5       )%         (0.3       )%
21.7                                          %          4.9        %
worldwide revenue growth in 2015 reflected the inclusion of carefusion's sales in the company's results as of april 1, 2015, as discussed above. revenue growth in 2015 was also attributable to consistent performance of our legacy products, the benefit of our diverse geographic and product portfolio, as well as sales in emerging markets. medical segment revenue growth in 2015 reflected the inclusion of carefusion's sales for the second half of the current year, growth in the medication and procedural solutions unit's international sales of safety-engineered products and growth in the diabetes care unit's sales of pen needles. life sciences segment revenue growth in 2015 was largely driven by sales of safety-engineered products in the preanalytical systems unit as well as by growth in the diagnostic systems unit.
revenues in the united states of $5.069 billion in 2015 increased 48.4% from 2014. international revenues in 2015 grew 3.6% to $5.213 billion, which includes an estimated unfavorable foreign exchange translation impact of 12.6%. in addition to the inclusion of carefusion's sales in results for the second half of the current year, u.s. revenue growth reflected strength in the medical segment's overall legacy product portfolio, the diagnostic systems unit's benefit from a stronger than normal flu season, and growth in the biosciences unit's research reagent sales and instrument placements. in addition to growth attributable to the carefusion acquisition, international revenues for 2015 reflected growth from both segments due to sales in emerging markets and of safety-engineered products. worldwide sales of safety-engineered products reflected the inclusion of carefusion's sales of safety-engineered products for the second half of the fiscal year, as well as growth that was attributable to bd's legacy safety-engineered products. u.s. sales of safety-engineered products in 2015 of $1.471 billion increased 21.8% compared with 2014 and international safety-engineered products revenues of $1.128 billion grew 10.9%, which reflected the estimated unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of 14%.
we continue to invest in research and development, geographic expansion, and new product promotions to drive further revenue and profit growth. our ability to sustain our long-term growth will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to expand our core business (including geographical expansion), develop innovative new products, and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness, including the integration of carefusion. while the economic environment for the healthcare industry has stabilized, pricing pressures continue for some of our products. healthcare utilization has stabilized and slightly improved in the united states; however, any destabilization in the future could adversely impact our u.s. businesses. additionally, macroeconomic challenges in europe continue to constrain healthcare utilization, although we
17
currently view the environment as stable. in emerging markets, the company's growth is dependent primarily on government funding for healthcare systems.
our financial position remains strong, with cash flows from operating activities totaling $1.73 billion in 2015. at september 30, 2015, we had $1.44 billion in cash and equivalents and short-term investments. we continued to return value to our shareholders in the form of dividends. during fiscal year 2015, we paid cash dividends of $485 million. no shares were repurchased during fiscal year 2015 due to the suspension of our share repurchase program for the near term, in connection with the carefusion acquisition, as our focus subsequent to closing the acquisition has been on the reduction of debt levels and the payment of dividends.
each reporting period, we face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations to the u.s. dollar at exchange rates that fluctuate from the beginning of such period. the ongoing strength of the u.s. dollar resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact to our revenue growth during the year, as discussed above. we evaluate our results of operations on both a reported and a foreign currency-neutral basis, which excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. we calculate foreign currency-neutral percentages by converting our current-period local currency financial results using the prior-period foreign currency exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current-period reported results. from time to time, we may purchase forward contracts and options to partially protect against adverse foreign exchange rate movements. gains or losses on our derivative instruments are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying hedged transactions. we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. for further discussion, refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
results of continuing operations comparisons of income from continuing operations between 2015 and 2014, as well as between 2014 and 2013, are affected by the specified items detailed below that are reflected in our financial results.

foreign exchange risk bd and its subsidiaries transact business in various foreign currencies throughout europe, greater asia, canada and latin america. we face foreign currency exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency. these payables and receivables primarily arise from intercompany transactions. we hedge substantially all such exposures, primarily through the use of forward contracts. we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations, including sales, to the u.s. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period. from time to time, we may purchase forward contracts and options to hedge certain forecasted transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies in order to partially protect against a reduction in the value of future earnings resulting from adverse foreign exchange rate movements. gains or losses on derivative instruments are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying hedged transactions. we did not enter into contracts to hedge cash flows against foreign currency fluctuations in fiscal year 2015 or 2014.
derivative financial instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. for foreign currency derivatives, market risk is determined by calculating the impact on fair value of an assumed change in foreign exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar. fair values were estimated based upon observable inputs, specifically spot currency rates and foreign currency prices for similar assets and liabilities.
with respect to the foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding at september 30, 2015 and 2014, the impact changes in the u.s. dollar would have on pre-tax earnings was estimated as follows:
increase (decrease)
2015   2014
(millions of dollars)
10% appreciation in u.s. dollar   $(28        )           $(19        )
10% depreciation in u.s. dollar   $28                     $19
these calculations do not reflect the impact of exchange gains or losses on the underlying transactions that would substantially offset the results of the derivative instruments.
interest rate risk our primary interest rate risk relates to u.s. dollar borrowings which are partially offset by u.s. dollar cash investments. when managing interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and floating rate instruments. we may enter into interest rate swaps to help maintain this balance and manage debt and interest-bearing investments in tandem, since these items have an offsetting impact on interest rate exposure. for interest rate derivative instruments, fair values are measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows using market-based observable inputs including credit risk and interest rate yield curves. market risk for these instruments is determined by calculating the impact to fair value of an assumed change in interest rates across all maturities. at september 30, 2015 and 2014, we had interest rate derivative contracts to convert interest payments on certain long-term debt notes from fixed rates to floating rates.
with respect to the interest rate derivatives outstanding at september 30, 2015 and 2014, the impact changes in the interest rate would have on the fair value of these derivatives was estimated as follows:
increase (decrease)
2015   2014
(millions of dollars)
10% increase in interest rates   $(3         )           $(6         )
10% decrease in interest rates   $3                      $6
based on our overall interest rate exposure at september 30, 2015 and 2014, a 10% change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our earnings or cash flows over a one-year period.

other risks from time to time, the company has managed price risks associated with commodity purchases through derivative contracts. at september 30, 2015, we had cash-settled forward contracts to hedge a portion of our global resin purchase volumes throughout fiscal years 2015 and 2016. a change in the underlying commodity price would not materially affect the value of our commodity derivative instruments outstanding at september 30, 2015.
liquidity and capital resources net cash flows from continuing operating activities net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $1.73 billion, $1.75 billion and $1.72 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and was primarily attributable to income from continuing operations, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization. the fiscal year 2015 change in operating assets and liabilities was a net source of cash and primarily reflected lower levels of inventory and higher levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by higher levels of prepayments. the lower levels of inventory reflected the impact, primarily recognized in the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, of the acquisition fair value step-up adjustment recorded relative to carefusion's inventory on the acquisition date. net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 increased by changes in the pension obligation as current-year expense was partially offset by discretionary contributions of $40 million. the 2014 change in operating assets and liabilities was a net use of cash and primarily reflected higher levels of inventory and prepaid expenses, partially offset by higher levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses. the 2014 change in operating liabilities included the payment of $22 million under a settlement agreement related to indirect purchaser antitrust class action cases. the change in accounts receivable includes a $36 million payment of government receivables balances in spain. net cash provided by continuing operating activities in 2014 was reduced by changes in the pension obligation resulting primarily from discretionary cash contributions of $75 million.
net cash flows from continuing investing activities net cash used for continuing investing activities was $8.32 billion, $948 million and $311 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
capital expenditures our investments in capital expenditures are focused on projects that enhance our cost structure and manufacturing capabilities, and support our strategy of geographic expansion with select investments in growing markets. capital spending in 2015, 2014 and 2013 related primarily to manufacturing capacity expansions and details of spending by segment are contained in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
investments cash inflows from the sales of investments of $840 million in 2015 were attributable to the maturities of time deposits in europe, latin america and asia pacific.
acquisitions of businesses cash outflows relating to acquisitions were $8.41 billion, $40 million and $136 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. cash outflows relating to acquisitions in 2015 were primarily attributable to the completion of the carefusion acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. cash outflows relating to acquisitions in 2015 also included cash payments relating to other acquisitions, including gencell, crisi, the arx group of companies and cellular research in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2015, respectively. cash outflows relating to acquisitions in 2014 represented cash paid to acquire alverix, inc. in the second quarter of fiscal year 2014. cash outflows in 2013 included $124 million relating to the safety syringes acquisition and $14 million associated with the cato acquisition in the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2013, respectively. for further discussion, refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data.
divestiture the cash inflow from divestiture of businesses in 2013 represents the first quarter fiscal year 2013 divestiture of the life sciences' discovery labware unit, excluding its advanced bioprocessing platform. we received approximately $740 million in total gross proceeds from the sale. for further discussion, refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data.

net cash flows from continuing financing activities net cash provided by (used for) continuing financing activities was $6.19 billion, $(807) million and $(968) million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
debt-related activities net cash provided by financing activities in 2015 included the proceeds from $6.2 billion of notes issued in december 2014 as well as $500 million total proceeds from net borrowings under commercial paper programs. these proceeds were used to finance the completion of our acquisition of carefusion in march 2015. for additional information regarding these financing arrangements, refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data and for additional information regarding the carefusion acquisition, refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data. in 2013, net cash used for financing activities reflected the repayment of $200 million of 4.55% notes due on april 15, 2013. total debt was $12.8 billion at september 30, 2015 and $4.0 billion at september 30, 2014 and 2013. measures relating to this debt are as follows:
2015                                                                2014          2013
short-term debt as a percentage of total debt     11.3   %       5.1   %       5.2   %
weighted average cost of total debt                3.3   %       3.7   %       3.8   %
total debt as a percentage of total capital (a)   58.4   %      43.4   %      43.1   %
(a)   represents shareholders' equity, net non-current deferred income tax liabilities, and debt the ratio of short-term debt as a percentage of total debt at september 30, 2015 reflected the reclassification, from long-term debt to short-term debt, of $750 million of floating rate notes due on june 15, 2016.
repurchase of common stock there were no share repurchases in 2015 as our share repurchase program was suspended in connection with our announced agreement to acquire carefusion. we repurchased approximately 3.6 million shares of our common stock for $400 million in 2014 and 5.5 million shares for $450 million in 2013. at september 30, 2015, a total of approximately 9.1 million common shares remained available for purchase under the board of directors' september 2013 share repurchase authorization.
cash and short-term investments at september 30, 2015, total worldwide cash and short-term investments were $1.4 billion, of which $1.1 billion was held in jurisdictions outside of the united states. we regularly review the amount of cash and short-term investments held outside the united states and currently intend to use such amounts to fund our international operations and their growth initiatives. in addition, if these amounts were repatriated from foreign jurisdictions to the united states, there could be adverse tax consequences.
credit facilities in january 2015 and in connection with our agreement to acquire carefusion, we entered into a commercial paper program which allows us to issue a maximum of $1 billion in notes. a former commercial paper program which had been in place to meet short-term financing needs was terminated in february 2015 and the outstanding borrowings of $200 million under the former program were rolled into the new commercial paper program. at september 30, 2015, subsequent to the completion of the carefusion acquisition on march 17, 2015, borrowings outstanding under the current commercial paper program were $700 million. also in connection with the carefusion acquisition, we entered into a 364-day term loan agreement in december 2014 that provided for a $1.0 billion term loan facility. at september 30, 2015, the term loan was fully repaid with no borrowings outstanding, reflecting principal payments of $650 million, $250 million and $100 million made in april, july and september 2015, respectively. the $9.1 billion of fully committed bridge financing we secured in the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, concurrently with our execution of the agreement to acquire carefusion, was terminated upon completion of the acquisition. additional disclosures regarding bd's financing arrangements relating to the carefusion acquisition are provided in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data.
we have available a $1 billion syndicated credit facility. this credit facility, under which there were no borrowings outstanding at september 30, 2015, provides backup support for our commercial paper program and can also be used for other general corporate purposes. it includes a provision that enables bd, subject to additional commitments made by the lenders, to access up to an additional $500 million in financing through the facility, for a maximum aggregate commitment of $1.5 billion. during the third quarter of fiscal year 2014, we extended the expiration date of this credit facility to may 2018 from the original expiration date of may 2017. the credit facility includes a single financial covenant that requires bd to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio (ratio of earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization to interest expense) of not less
26
than 5-to-1 for the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters. we were in compliance with this covenant as of september 30, 2015. in addition, we have informal lines of credit outside the united states.
carefusion debt assumed upon the closing of the carefusion acquisition in march 2015, bd assumed senior unsecured notes issued by carefusion with an aggregate principal amount of $2 billion. subsequent to closing the acquisition, bd commenced offers to exchange these carefusion notes for notes issued by bd and this exchange offer expired in april 2015. additional disclosures regarding this exchange offer are provided in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data.
access to capital and credit ratings our ability to generate cash flow from operations, issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms could be adversely affected in the event there was a material decline in the demand for our products, deterioration in our key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other significantly unfavorable changes in conditions.
bd's credit ratings at september 30, 2015 were as follows:
standard &amp; poor's   moody's ratings:
senior unsecured debt   bbb+                    baa2
commercial paper        a-2                     p-2
outlook                 stable                  stable subsequent to bd's announcement regarding our acquisition of carefusion, the two major corporate debt rating organizations, moody's investors service (moody's) and standard & poor's ratings services (s&p), provided guidance that they expected to downgrade our debt ratings as a result of the anticipated increase in bd's net leverage. in december 2014, s&p downgraded bd's long-term debt and commercial paper ratings from a to bbb+ and from a-1 to a-2, respectively. following our announced completion of the carefusion acquisition on march 17, 2015, moody's converted its provisional downgrade of bd's long-term debt rating, from a3 to baa2, to a definitive downgrade. concurrently with these downgrade actions, bd's ratings with both s&p and moody's were removed from further review.
bd's credit ratings remain investment grade after these downgrades. as such, we do not expect these downgrades to have a significant impact on our liquidity or future flexibility to access additional liquidity given our strong balance sheet, our syndicated credit facility, and our commercial paper program. while such downgrades in our credit ratings may increase the costs associated with maintaining and borrowing under our existing credit arrangements, the downgrades do not affect our ability to draw on these credit facilities, nor do they result in an acceleration of the scheduled maturities of any outstanding debt. we believe that given our debt ratings, our financial management policies, our ability to generate cash flow and the non-cyclical, geographically diversified nature of our businesses, we would have access to additional short-term and long-term capital should the need arise. a rating reflects only the view of a rating agency and is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. ratings can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change.
27
contractual obligations in the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future. the table below sets forth bd's significant contractual obligations and related scheduled payments as of september 30, 2015:

critical accounting policies the following discussion supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data. the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates. management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. for any given estimate or assumption made by management, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. actual results that differ from management's estimates could have an unfavorable effect on our consolidated financial statements. management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements:
revenue recognition some of our sales transactions qualify as multiple-element arrangements which require us to identify separate units of accounting within the arrangement and allocate the transaction consideration across these separate accounting units. for arrangements that include software and non-software elements, the transaction consideration is allocated to the software elements as a group as well as to the individual non-software elements that have been separately identified. the identification of accounting units and the allocation of total transaction consideration for multiple-element arrangements may be subjective and requires a degree of management judgment. management's judgments relative to multiple-element arrangements may significantly affect the timing of revenue recognition.
transaction consideration for separately identified non-software units of accounting within an arrangement is recognized upon the completion of each deliverable based on its relative selling price. when applying the relative selling price method, the selling price of each deliverable is determined based upon the following hierarchy of evidence: vendor-specific objective evidence, which is generally based upon historical prices in stand-alone transactions; third-party evidence, which is generally based on market data on sales of similar products and services, if available; and management's best estimate of selling price. management's best estimate of selling price is generally based upon the following considerations: stand-alone sales prices, established price lists, costs to produce, profit margins for similar products, market conditions, and customer stratification.
for software and software-related products, we use the relative fair value method to allocate transaction consideration to each unit of accounting; whereby the evidence used in the determination of fair value estimates are based solely on vendor-specific objective evidence. to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence does not exist for delivered elements of the transaction, we apply the residual method.
28
the revenue allocated to equipment or instruments in multiple-element arrangements is recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer. the revenue allocated to extended warranty contracts and software maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized as these deliverables are performed under the arrangement. the majority of deferred revenue relating to extended warranty contracts is generally recognized within a few years whereas deferred revenue relating to software maintenance contracts is generally recognized over several years.
accounting for sales-type leases our accounting for sales-type leases is based upon certain assumptions including the economic life of our leased products and the fair value of our leased products, which is used to determine the interest rate implicit to the lease. these assumptions affect that amount of gross investment in the lease, unearned income, and the sales price that is recognized relative to each sales-type lease transaction. based upon our anticipation of future technological advances of our products or that of our competitors, the economic life of our leased products is five years as this is the estimated period during which the leased product is expected to be economically usable, without limitation by the lease term. additionally, five years represents the most frequent contractual lease term for our leased products. our product configurations are customized for each customer's specifications, and as such, there is no significant after-market for our used equipment. residual values, if any, are established at lease inception using estimates of the fair value of reclaimable component parts of the products at the end of the lease term.
the fair value of our leased products is estimated on a quarterly basis, based upon transacted cash sales prices during the preceding 12-month period, and represents normal selling price, reflecting any volume or trade discounts that may apply. because our products are sold as part of customized systems to a diverse range of customers, many of which are affiliated with a group purchasing organization or integrated delivery network, there is a wide range of negotiated cash selling prices for our products. accordingly, we stratify our cash selling transactions based on product configuration and customer class to determine a best estimate of fair value for each product specific, within determined customer classes. based upon this stratification, we calculate the weighted average selling price of each configured product using the interquartile range methodology and remove outliers from the population of normal cash selling prices, which narrows the range of selling prices within each stratified customer class. the resulting weighted average selling price is the single point estimate of fair value that we use as the normal selling price and this fair value estimate is used to determine the implicit interest rate for each product subject to a sales-type lease arrangement. in certain instances, we do not have sufficient corresponding historical cash selling transactions to support fair values of specific combinations of product configurations and customer classes. in these instances, fair value is estimated by applying the average discount percentage given to the respective customer class, over the trailing 12 months, to the list price of the products whose fair value was not determined using the interquartile range methodology described above. the resulting fair value(s) is then used to derive the implicit rate of the lease. the interest rate implicit to the lease is then used to determine the amount of revenue recognized at the inception of the lease and the revenue recognized over the life of the lease.
our net investment in sales-type leases primarily arises from the leasing of dispensing equipment and as such, the methodology for determining the relating allowance for credit losses is based on the collective population and is not stratified by class or portfolio segment. the allowance for credit losses is based on historical experience loss rates as well as on management's judgments regarding the potential impact of anticipated changes in business practices, market dynamics, and economic conditions. these assumptions are inherently subjective and it is possible that we will experience actual credit losses that are different from our current estimates.
accounting for software products we sell and lease products with embedded software and as such, we must evaluate these products to determine if industry-specific revenue recognition requirements apply to these sales transactions. this evaluation process is often complex and subject to significant judgment. if software is considered not essential to the non-software elements of a product but is considered more than incidental to a product as a whole, the product's software elements must be separated from its non-software elements under the requirements relating to multiple-element arrangements. the product's software elements must be accounted for under software industry-specific revenue recognition requirements and the application of these requirements may significantly affect the timing and amount of revenue recognized.
we have determined that the software embedded within our infusion products, when sold with safety software, patient identification products, and certain diagnostic equipment, as well as the software embedded within our research and clinical instruments sold by our biosciences unit, is more than incidental to these product offerings as a whole. however, we have determined that the non-software elements and software elements in these product offerings work together to deliver the essential functionality of these products as a whole. as such, the accounting for these product offerings does not fall within the scope of software industry-specific accounting requirements. we have determined the embedded software within certain other products, primarily dispensing and respiratory products, is incidental to the products as a whole and therefore the accounting for these products also falls outside the scope of software-specific requirements. generally, our standalone software application sales and any related post-contract support related to these sales are accounted for under the software industry-specific revenue recognition requirements.
29
impairment of assets goodwill and in-process research and development assets are subject to impairment reviews at least annually, or whenever indicators of impairment arise. intangible assets with finite lives, including developed technology, and other long-lived assets, are periodically reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present.
we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. our reporting units generally represent one level below reporting segments and we aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics. potential impairment of goodwill is identified by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value. our annual goodwill impairment test performed on july 1, 2015 did not result in any impairment charges, as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. we reassessed our reporting units upon the previously discussed realignment of bd's organizational structure, from a three-segment to a two-segment structure, on october 1, 2014 and upon our acquisition of carefusion on march 17, 2015. while the segment realignment did not change bd's reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the reporting units within the medical segment were redefined as a result of the carefusion acquisition.
we generally use the income approach to derive the fair value for impairment assessments. this approach calculates fair value by estimating future cash flows attributable to the assets and then discounting these cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. we selected this method because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets. this approach requires significant management judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, appropriate discount rates and other assumptions and estimates. the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with bd's business plans. the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset, and potentially result in different impacts to bd's results of operations. actual results may differ from management's estimates.
income taxes bd maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change. in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry back and carry forward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset.
bd conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions. in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, we record accruals for uncertain tax positions based on the technical support for the positions, our past audit experience with similar situations, and the potential interest and penalties related to the matters. bd's effective tax rate in any given period could be impacted if, upon resolution with taxing authorities, we prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established, or we were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves.
bd has reviewed its needs in the u.s. for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and, with exception for certain countries, continues to invest foreign subsidiaries earnings outside of the u.s. to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property, plant and equipment expenditure needs. deferred taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested. at september 30, 2015, the cumulative amount of such undistributed earnings indefinitely reinvested outside the united states was $7.5 billion. the determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.
contingencies we are involved, both as a plaintiff and a defendant, in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, product liability, antitrust and environmental matters, as further discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data. we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. we establish accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable (in the case of environmental matters, without considering possible third-party recoveries). a determination of the amount of accruals, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue and, when appropriate, is developed after consultation with outside counsel. the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in our strategy in dealing with these matters.
given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party. in view of these uncertainties, we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, excess liability insurance. in the opinion of management, any such future charges, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on bd's consolidated results of operations and consolidated net cash flows.

benefit plans we have significant net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit costs that are measured using actuarial valuations. these benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate. pension benefit costs also include an assumption for the expected return on plan assets. these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. in addition to the analysis below, see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion.
the discount rate is selected each year based on investment grade bonds and other factors as of the measurement date (september 30). specifically for the u.s. pension plan, we will use a discount rate of 4.15% for 2016, which was based on an actuarially-determined, company-specific yield curve to measure liabilities as of the measurement date. to calculate the pension expense in 2016, we will apply the individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments in order to calculate interest cost and service cost. additional disclosures regarding the method to be used in calculating the interest cost and service cost components of pension expense for 2016 are provided in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data. the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, although reviewed each year, changes less frequently due to the long-term nature of the assumption. this assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of the measurement date; rather, it is used only in the calculation of pension expense. to determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider many factors, including our historical assumptions compared with actual results; benchmark data; expected returns on various plan asset classes, as well as current and expected asset allocations. we will use a long-term expected rate of return on plan assets assumption of 7.50% for the u.s. pension plan in 2016. we believe our discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors.
sensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our u.s. pension and other postretirement and postemployment plans are as follows:
•   discount rate - a change of plus (minus) 25 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $4 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the total u.s. net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan costs. this estimate assumes no change in the shape or steepness of the company-specific yield curve used to plot the individual spot rates that will be applied to the future cash outflows for future benefit payments in order to calculate interest and service cost.
•   expected return on plan assets - a change of plus (minus) 25 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $3 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on u.s. pension plan costs.
share-based compensation compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions is recognized in net income using a fair value measurement method. all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized in the statement of operations as compensation expense (based on their fair values) over the vesting period of the awards. we determine the fair value of certain share-based awards using a lattice-based binomial option valuation model that incorporates certain assumptions, such as the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of the options. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion.
cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements bd and its representatives may from time to time make certain forward-looking statements in publicly released materials, both written and oral, including statements contained in filings with the securities and exchange commission, press releases, and our reports to shareholders. forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as "plan," "expect," "believe," "intend," "will," "anticipate," "estimate" and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of future operations and financial performance, as well as our strategy for growth, product development, regulatory approvals, market position and expenditures. all statements that address operating performance or events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future - including statements relating to volume growth, sales and earnings per share growth, cash flows or uses, and statements expressing views about future operating results - are forward-looking statements.
forward-looking statements are based on current expectations of future events. the forward-looking statements are, and will be, based on management's then-current views and assumptions regarding future events, developments and operating performance, and speak only as of their dates. investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from our expectations and projections. investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. furthermore, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events and developments or otherwise, except as required by applicable law or regulations.

the following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward-looking statements. for further discussion of certain of these factors, see item 1a. risk factors.
•   weakness in the global economy and financial markets, and the potential adverse effect on the cost of operating our business, the demand for our products and services, the prices for our products and services due to increases in pricing pressure, or our ability to produce our products, including the impact on developing countries.
•   deficit reduction efforts or other adverse changes in the availability of government funding for healthcare and research, particularly in the united states and europe, that could further weaken demand for our products and result in additional pricing pressures, as well as create potential collection risks associated with such sales.
•   risks relating to our acquisition of carefusion, including our ability to successfully combine and integrate the carefusion operations in order to obtain the anticipated benefits and costs savings from the transaction, and the significant additional indebtedness we incurred in connection with the financing of the acquisition and the impact this increased indebtedness may have on our ability to operate the combined company.
•   the consequences of the patient protection and affordable care act in the united states, which implemented an excise tax on u.s. sales of certain medical devices, and which could result in reduced demand for our products, increased pricing pressures or otherwise adversely affect our business.
•   future healthcare reform in the countries in which we do business that may involve changes in government pricing and reimbursement policies or other cost containment reforms.
•   changes in domestic and foreign healthcare industry practices that result in a reduction in procedures using our products or increased pricing pressures, including the continued consolidation among healthcare providers and trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. for example, changes to guidelines providing for increased cervical cancer screening intervals has and may continue to negatively impact sales of our women's health and cancer platform.
•   changes in reimbursement practices of third-party payers.
•   our ability to penetrate emerging markets, which depends on local economic and political conditions, and how well we are able to acquire or form strategic business alliances with local companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities and distribution networks. our international operations also increase our compliance risks, including risks under the foreign corrupt practices act and other anti-corruption laws.
•   political conditions in international markets, including civil unrest, terrorist activity, governmental changes, trade barriers, restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders and expropriation of assets by a government.
•   security breaches of our computer and communications systems, including computer viruses, "hacking" and "cyber-attacks," which could impair our ability to conduct business, or result in the loss of bd trade secrets or otherwise compromise sensitive information of bd or its customers, suppliers and other business partners.
•   fluctuations in the cost and availability of oil-based resins and other raw materials, as well as certain components, the ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships (particularly with respect to sole-source suppliers), and the potential adverse effects of any disruption in the availability of such items.
•   regional, national and foreign economic factors, including inflation, deflation, fluctuations in interest rates and, in particular, foreign currency exchange rates, and the potential effect on our revenues, expenses, margins and credit ratings.
•   new or changing laws and regulations affecting our domestic and foreign operations, or changes in enforcement practices, including laws relating to trade, monetary and fiscal policies, taxation (including tax reforms that could adversely impact multinational corporations), sales practices, environmental protection, price controls and licensing and regulatory requirements for new products and products in the postmarketing phase. in particular, the u.s. and other countries may impose new requirements regarding registration, labeling or prohibited materials that may require us to re-register products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products. environmental laws, particularly with respect to the emission of greenhouse gases, are also becoming more stringent throughout the world, which may increase our costs of operations or necessitate changes in our manufacturing plants or processes or those of our suppliers, or result in liability to bd.
•   product efficacy or safety concerns regarding our products resulting in product recalls, regulatory action on the part of the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) or foreign counterparts, declining sales and product liability claims, particularly in light of the current regulatory environment, including increased enforcement activity by the fda. as a result of the carefusion acquisition, we are operating under a consent decree with the fda relating to our u.s. infusion pump business. the consent decree authorizes the fda, in the event of any violations in the future, to order us to cease manufacturing and distributing products, recall products or take other actions, and we may be required to pay significant monetary damages if we fail to comply with any provision of the consent decree.
32
•   competitive factors that could adversely affect our operations, including new product introductions (for example, new forms of drug delivery) by our current or future competitors, increased pricing pressure due to the impact of low-cost manufacturers as certain competitors have established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers in low-cost manufacturing locations as a means to lower their costs, patents attained by competitors (particularly as patents on our products expire), and new entrants into our markets.
•   the effects of events that adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products (particularly where production of a product line is concentrated in one or more plants) or our ability to source materials or components from suppliers (including sole-source suppliers) that are needed for such manufacturing, including pandemics, natural disasters, or environmental factors.
•   difficulties inherent in product development, including the potential inability to successfully continue technological innovation, complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals in the united states and abroad, obtain intellectual property protection for our products, obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for new products, or gain and maintain market approval of products, as well as the possibility of infringement claims by competitors with respect to patents or other intellectual property rights, all of which can preclude or delay commercialization of a product. delays in obtaining necessary approvals or clearances from the fda or other regulatory agencies or changes in the regulatory process may also delay product launches and increase development costs.
•   fluctuations in the demand for products we sell to pharmaceutical companies that are used to manufacture, or are sold with, the products of such companies, as a result of funding constraints, consolidation or otherwise.
•   fluctuations in university or u.s. and international governmental funding and policies for life sciences research.
•   our ability to achieve our projected level or mix of product sales, as our earnings forecasts are based on projected sales volumes and pricing of many product types, some of which are more profitable than others.
•   our ability to complete the implementation of our ongoing upgrade of our enterprise resource planning system, as any delays or deficiencies in completing the implementation could adversely affect our business.
•   pending and potential future litigation or other proceedings adverse to bd, including antitrust, product liability, environmental and patent infringement, and the availability or collectability of insurance relating to any such claims.
•   the effect of adverse media exposure or other publicity regarding bd's business or operations, including the effect on bd's reputation or demand for its products.
•   the effect of market fluctuations on the value of assets in bd's pension plans and on actuarial interest rate and asset return assumptions, which could require bd to make additional contributions to the plans or increase our pension plan expense.
•   the impact of business combinations, including any volatility in earnings relating to acquired in-process research and development assets, and our ability to successfully integrate any business we may acquire.
•   our ability to obtain the anticipated benefits of restructuring programs, if any, that we may undertake.
•   issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the financial accounting standards board or the securities and exchange commission.
the foregoing list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could impact our ability to achieve results described in any forward-looking statements. investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.

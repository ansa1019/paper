item 1a.   risk factors the following are important factors that could affect our financial performance and could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations, including those expressed in any forward-looking statements made in this 10-k. we may also refer to this disclosure to identify factors that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed in other forward-looking statements, including those made in oral presentations such as telephone conferences and webcasts open to the public.
economic recessions could have a significant, adverse impact on our business. the transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession, downturns in business cycles of our customers, interest rate fluctuations, and other economic factors beyond our control. deterioration in the economic environment subjects our business to various risks, which may have a material and adverse impact on our operating results and cause us to not reach our long-term growth goals:
•   decrease in volumes-a reduction in overall freight volumes in the marketplace reduces our opportunities for growth. a significant portion of our freight is transactional or "spot" market opportunities. the transactional market may be more impacted than the freight market by overall economic conditions. in addition, if a downturn in our customers' business cycles causes a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers, particularly among certain national retailers or in the food, beverage, retail, manufacturing, paper, or printing industries, our operating results could be adversely affected.
•   credit risk and working capital-some of our customers may face economic difficulties and may not be able to pay us, and some may go out of business. in addition, some customers may not pay us as quickly as they have in the past, causing our working capital needs to increase.
•   transportation provider failures-a significant number of our transportation providers may go out of business and we may be unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers.
•   expense management-we may not be able to appropriately adjust our expenses to changing market demands. personnel expenses are our largest expense. in order to maintain high variability in our business model, it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands. in periods of rapid change, it is more difficult to match our staffing levels to our business needs. in addition, we have other expenses that are fixed for a period of time, and we may not be able to adequately adjust them in a period of rapid change in market demand.
higher carrier prices may result in decreased net revenue margin. carriers can be expected to charge higher prices if market conditions warrant, or to cover higher operating expenses. our net revenues and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to increase our pricing to our customers. increased demand for truckload services and pending changes in regulations may reduce available capacity and increase carrier pricing.
13
changing fuel costs and interruptions of fuel supplies may have an impact on our net revenue margins. in our truckload transportation business, which is the largest source of our net revenues, fluctuating fuel prices may result in decreased net revenue margin. while our different pricing arrangements with customers and contracted carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact, we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a pass-through cost to our truckload business. in times of fluctuating fuel prices, our net revenue margin may also fluctuate.
our dependence on third parties to provide equipment and services may impact the delivery and quality of our transportation and logistics services. we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering our customers' freight. we depend on independent third parties to provide truck, rail, ocean, and air services and to report certain events to us, including delivery information and freight claims. these independent third parties may not fulfill their obligations to us, preventing us from meeting our commitments to our customers. this reliance also could cause delays in reporting certain events, including recognizing revenue and claims. in addition, if we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services from third parties to meet our commitments to our customers, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected, and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently. many of these risks are beyond our control including:
•   equipment shortages in the transportation industry, particularly among contracted truckload carriers;
•   changes in regulations impacting transportation;
•   disruption in the supply or cost of fuel;
•   reduction or deterioration in rail service; and
•   unanticipated changes in transportation rates.
we are subject to negative impacts of changes in political and governmental conditions. our operations are subject to the influences of significant political, governmental, and similar changes and our ability to respond to them, including:
•   changes in political conditions and in governmental policies;
•   changes in and compliance with international and domestic laws and regulations; and
•   wars, civil unrest, acts of terrorism, and other conflicts.
we may be subject to negative impacts of catastrophic events. a disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, heightened security measures, actual or threatened, terrorist attack, strike, civil unrest, pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in providing services or performing other critical functions. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and adversely impact our operating results.
our international operations subject us to operational and financial risks. we provide services within and between foreign countries on an increasing basis. our business outside of the united states is subject to various risks, including:
•   changes in tariffs, trade restrictions, trade agreements, and taxations;
•   difficulties in managing or overseeing foreign operations and agents;
•   limitations on the repatriation of funds because of foreign exchange controls;
•   different liability standards; and
•   intellectual property laws of countries that do not protect our rights in our intellectual property, including, but not limited to, our proprietary information systems, to the same extent as the laws of the united states.
the occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region and/or decrease the profitability of our operations in that region.
14
as we continue to expand our business internationally, we expose the company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls, as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles. foreign currency fluctuations could result in currency translation exchange gains or losses or could affect the book value of our assets and liabilities. furthermore, we may experience unanticipated changes to our income tax liabilities resulting from changes in geographical income mix and changing international tax legislation. we have limited control over these risks, and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions, we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects.
our ability to appropriately staff and retain employees is important to our variable cost model. our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain a large group of motivated salespeople and other logistics professionals. in order to maintain high variability in our business model, it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands. in periods of rapid change, it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel. because of our comprehensive employee training program, our employees are attractive targets for new and existing competitors. continued success depends in large part on our ability to develop successful employees into managers.
we face substantial industry competition. competition in the transportation services industry is intense and broad-based. we compete against logistics companies, as well as transportation providers that own equipment, third party freight brokers, internet matching services, internet freight brokers, and carriers offering logistics services. we also compete against carriers' internal sales forces. in addition, customers can bring in-house some of the services we provide to them. we often buy and sell transportation services from and to many of our competitors. increased competition could reduce our market opportunity and create downward pressure on freight rates, and continued rate pressure may adversely affect our net revenue and income from operations.
we rely on technology to operate our business. we have internally developed the majority of our operating systems. our continued success is dependent on our systems continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers and users. we rely on our technology staff and vendors to successfully implement changes to and maintain our operating systems in an efficient manner. if we fail to maintain and enhance our operating systems, we may be at a competitive disadvantage and lose customers.
as demonstrated by recent material and high-profile data security breaches, computer malware, viruses, and computer hacking and phishing attacks have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may occur on our systems in the future. previous attacks on our systems have not had a material financial impact on our operations, but we cannot guarantee that future attacks will have little to no impact on our business. furthermore, given the interconnected nature of the supply chain and our significant presence in the industry, we believe that we may be an attractive target for such attacks.
though it is difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack, a significant impact on the performance, reliability, security, and availability of our systems and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users may harm our reputation, impair our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers, and expose us to legal claims and government action, each of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.
because we manage our business on a decentralized basis, our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent management practices. we manage our business on a decentralized basis through a network of offices throughout north america, europe, asia, and south america, supported by executives and shared and centralized services, with local management responsible for day-to-day operations, profitability, personnel decisions, the growth of the business, and adherence to applicable local laws. our decentralized operating strategy can make it difficult for us to implement strategic decisions and coordinated procedures throughout our global operations. in addition, some of our offices operate with management, sales, and support personnel that may be insufficient to support growth in their respective location without significant central oversight and coordination. our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent management practices and materially and adversely affect our overall profitability and expose us to litigation.
our earnings may be affected by seasonal changes in the transportation industry. results of operations for our industry generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season. in recent years, including 2015 and 2014, our operating income and earnings have been lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters. however, this was not our experience in 2013. although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations, we expect this trend to continue, and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future.
15
we are subject to claims arising from our transportation operations. we use the services of thousands of transportation companies in connection with our transportation operations. from time to time, the drivers employed and engaged by the carriers we contract with are involved in accidents, which may result in serious personal injuries. the resulting types and/or amounts of damages may be excluded by or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the contracted carrier. although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees, owner-operators, or independent contractors working for carriers, from time to time, claims may be asserted against us for their actions, or for our actions in retaining them. claims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage, or may not be covered by insurance at all. in addition, our automobile liability policy has a retention of $5 million per incident. a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents, liability claims or workers' compensation claims, or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially and adversely affect our operating results. in addition, significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability. our involvement in the transportation of certain goods, including but not limited to hazardous materials, could also increase our exposure in the event one of our contracted carriers is involved in an accident resulting in injuries or contamination.
our sourcing business is dependent upon the supply and price of fresh produce. the supply and price of fresh produce is affected by weather and growing conditions (such as drought, insects, and disease) and other conditions over which we have no control. commodity prices can be affected by shortages or overproduction and are often highly volatile. if we are unable to secure fresh produce to meet our commitments to our customers, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected, and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently. to assure access to certain commodities, we occasionally make advances to growers to finance their operations. repayment of these advances is dependent upon the growers' ability to grow and harvest marketable crops.
buying and reselling fresh produce exposes us to possible product liability. agricultural chemicals used on fresh produce are subject to various approvals, and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination. product recalls in the produce industry have been caused by concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination, often leading to lawsuits brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce. we may face claims for a variety of damages arising from the sale of produce, which may include potentially uninsured consequential damages. while we are insured for up to $201 million for product liability claims, settlement of class action claims, subject to a $250,000 deductible, is often costly, and we cannot guarantee that our liability coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available. if we have to recall produce, we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing, transporting, and destroying any allegedly contaminated product, as well as consequential damages, which our insurance did not cover prior to 2012. since 2012, we have carried product recall insurance coverage of $50 million. this policy has a retention of $5 million per incident. any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation, particularly of our proprietary and/or licensed branded produce programs. loss due to spoilage (including the need for disposal) is also a routine part of the sourcing business.
our business depends upon compliance with numerous government regulations. our operations may be regulated and licensed by various federal, state, and local transportation agencies in the united states and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate.
we are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the u.s. department of transportation ("dot") to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle. the dot prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity, including certain surety bonding requirements. we are also subject to regulation by the federal maritime commission as an ocean freight forwarder and a nvocc, and we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each. we operate as a department of homeland security certified indirect air carrier, providing air freight services, subject to commercial standards set forth by the international air transport association and federal regulations issued by the transportation security administration. we provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the bureau of u.s. customs and border protection. we also have and maintain other licenses as required by law.
we source fresh produce under a license issued by the u.s. department of agriculture. we are also subject to various regulations and requirements promulgated by other international, domestic, state, and local agencies and port authorities. our failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to entities holding these licenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.
legislative or regulatory changes can affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for, and the cost of providing, transportation services. as part of our logistics services, we operate leased warehouse facilities. our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services, and we are subject to various federal, state, and international environmental, work safety, and hazardous materials regulations. we may experience an increase in operating costs, such as security costs, as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities. no assurances can be given that we will be
16
able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surcharges, and our operations and profitability may suffer as a result.
department of homeland security regulations applicable to our customers who import goods into the united states and our contracted ocean carriers can impact our ability to provide and/or receive services with and from these parties. enforcement measures related to violations of these regulations can slow and/or prevent the delivery of shipments, which may negatively impact our operations.
we cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business. our failure to maintain required permits or licenses, or to comply with applicable regulations, could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses.
our freight carriers are subject to increasingly stringent laws protecting the environment, including those relating to climate change, which could directly or indirectly have a material adverse effect on our business. future and existing environmental regulatory requirements in the u.s. and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating expenses, which in turn could increase our purchased transportation costs. if we are unable to pass such costs along to our customers, our business could be materially and adversely affected. even without any new legislation or regulation, increased public concern regarding greenhouse gases emitted by transportation carriers could harm the reputations of companies operating in the transportation logistics industries and shift consumer demand toward more locally sourced products and away from our services.
we derive a significant portion of our total revenues and net revenues from our largest customers. our top 100 customers comprise approximately 29 percent of our consolidated total revenues and 25 percent of consolidated net revenues. our largest customer comprises approximately two percent of our consolidated total revenues. the sudden loss of many of our major clients could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
we may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments. we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses, products, services, or technologies. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates. even if we identify suitable candidates, we cannot guarantee that we will make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. the timing and number of acquisitions we pursue may also cause volatility in our financial results. in addition, we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments. the issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholders.
we may have difficulties integrating acquired companies. for acquisitions, success depends upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations. these risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time. we are required to integrate these businesses into our internal control environment, which may present challenges that are different than those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult to manage. if we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
our growth and profitability may not continue, which may result in a decrease in our stock price. our long-term growth objective is to grow earnings per share by 10 percent. there can be no assurance that our long-term growth objective will be achieved or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management, administrative, and operational systems to respond to any future growth. future changes in and expansion of our business, or changes in economic or political conditions, could adversely affect our operating margins. slower or less profitable growth or losses could adversely affect our stock price.

overview our company. we are a global provider of transportation services and logistics solutions, operating through a network of offices in north america, europe, asia, and south america. as a third party logistics provider, we enter into contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies, and utilize those relationships to efficiently and cost effectively transport our customers' freight. we have contractual relationships with approximately 68,000 transportation companies, including motor carriers, railroads (primarily intermodal service providers), air freight, and ocean carriers. depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements, we select and hire the appropriate transportation for each shipment. our model enables us to be flexible, provide solutions that optimize service for our customers, and minimize our asset utilization risk.
in addition to transportation and logistics services, we also buy and sell fresh produce. our sourcing business is the buying, selling, and marketing of fresh produce. we purchase fresh produce through our network of produce suppliers and sell it to retail grocers, restaurant chains, produce wholesalers, and foodservice providers. in some cases, we also arrange the transportation of the produce we sell through our relationships with specialized transportation companies. those revenues are reported as transportation revenues.
our business model. we are primarily a service company. we add value and expertise in the procurement and execution of transportation and logistics, including sourcing of produce products for our customers. our total revenues represent the total dollar value of services and goods we sell to our customers. our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services, including contracted motor carrier, rail, ocean, air, and other costs, and the purchase price and services related to the products we source. our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source, add value, and sell services and products that are provided by third parties, and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement. accordingly, the discussion of our results of operations below focuses on the changes in our net revenues.
we keep our business model as variable as possible to allow us to be flexible and adapt to changing economic and industry conditions. we sell transportation services and produce to our customers with varied pricing arrangements. some prices are committed to for a period of time, subject to certain terms and conditions, and some prices are set on a spot market basis. we buy most of our truckload transportation capacity and produce on a spot market basis. because of this, our net revenue per transaction tends to increase in times when there is excess supply and decrease in times when demand is strong relative to supply.
in 2015, changing market conditions impacted our results. fuel prices declined throughout 2015, which contributed to slower growth of our total revenues and an increase in our transportation net revenue margins. in 2015, we completed the acquisition of freightquote.com, inc. ("freightquote"). this acquisition contributed approximately 6.5 percentage points to our consolidated net revenue growth in 2015, primarily in our ltl service line.
in 2014, market conditions were very different than in 2013. there were capacity constraints in nearly all of our transportation services. additionally, we experienced a decrease in the length of haul in our north american truckload business in 2014 compared to 2013, which contributed to increased net revenue margin in our truckload transportation business. in general, a shorter length of haul can result in higher customer rates and transportation costs per mile.
we keep our personnel and other operating expenses as variable as possible. compensation is performance-oriented and, for most employees in the office network, based on the profitability of their individual office.
25
our personnel decisions are decentralized. our office managers determine the appropriate number of employees for their offices, within productivity guidelines, based on their volume of business. this helps keep our personnel expense as variable as possible with the business.
our office network. our office network is a competitive advantage. building local customer and contract carrier relationships has been an important part of our success, and our worldwide network of offices supports our core strategy of serving customers locally, nationally, and globally. our network offices help us penetrate local markets, provide face-to-face service when needed, and recruit contract carriers. our network also gives us knowledge of local market conditions, which is important in the transportation industry because it is market driven and very dynamic.
in january 2015, we completed our acquisition of freightquote, a privately held freight broker based in kansas city, missouri. freightquote provides services throughout north america. the acquisition enhances and brings synergies to our ltl and truckload businesses, and expands our ecommerce capabilities.
our people. because we are a service company, our continued success is dependent on our ability to continue to hire and retain talented, productive people, and to properly align our headcount and personnel expense with our business. our headcount increased by 1,638 employees during 2015. approximately 60 percent of this increase is a result of our acquisition of freightquote. employees act as a team in their sales efforts, customer service, and operations. a significant portion of many of our employees' compensation is performance-oriented, based on individual performance and the profitability of their office. we believe this makes our employees more service-oriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivity. all of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating long-term ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders.
our customers. in 2015, we worked with more than 110,000 active customers. we work with a wide variety of companies, ranging in size from fortune 100 companies to small family businesses, in many different industries. our customer base is very diverse and unconcentrated. in 2015, our top 100 customers represented approximately 29 percent of our total revenues and approximately 25 percent of our net revenues. our largest customer was approximately two percent of our total revenues.
our contracted carriers. our contracted carrier base includes motor carriers, railroads (primarily intermodal service providers), air freight, and ocean carriers. in 2015, our carrier base was approximately 68,000, up from approximately 63,000 in 2014. motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 83 percent of our truckload shipments in 2015. in our transportation business, no single contracted carrier represents more than approximately two percent of our contracted carrier capacity.
2015 compared to 2014
total revenues and direct costs. total transportation revenues increased 0.4 percent to $12.0 billion in 2015 from $11.9 billion in 2014. this increase in transportation revenues was driven by our acquisition of freightquote and higher volumes in nearly all of our transportation modes. these increases were partially offset by decreased pricing to our customers primarily related to the declining cost of fuel. total purchased transportation and related services decreased 2.0 percent in 2015 to $9.8 billion from $10.0 billion in 2014. this decrease was due to decreased transportation costs, primarily related to the declining cost of fuel, partially offset by the acquisition of freightquote and higher volumes in nearly all of our transportation modes. our sourcing revenue decreased 3.1 percent to $1.49 billion in 2015 from $1.53 billion in 2014. purchased products sourced for resale decreased 3.7 percent in 2015 to $1.37 billion from $1.42 billion in 2014. these decreases were primarily due to decreased revenue and cost per case, partially offset by increased case volumes.
net revenues. total transportation net revenues increased 13.5 percent to $2.1 billion in 2015 from $1.9 billion in 2014. our transportation net revenue margin increased to 17.9 percent in 2015 from 15.9 percent in 2014. this increase in net revenue margin was driven by a decrease in transportation costs, including fuel, and a change in the mix of business due to growth in shorter length of haul freight and the addition of freightquote.
26
our truckload net revenues increased 10.6 percent to $1.3 billion in 2015 from $1.2 billion in 2014. truckload volumes increased approximately six percent in 2015. organic truckload net revenues increased approximately seven percent in 2015. our acquisition of freightquote contributed approximately 3.5 percentage points to our truckload net revenue growth in 2015. north american truckload volumes increased approximately six percent in 2015. north american truckload volumes, excluding freightquote, increased approximately three percent in 2015. truckload net revenue margin increased in 2015 due the declining cost of fuel. in our truckload business, the cost of fuel is generally a pass through to our customers. therefore, in periods of declining fuel prices, we tend to experience higher net revenue margin. excluding the estimated impact of the change in fuel, on average, our truckload rates increased approximately one percent in 2015. our truckload transportation costs were relatively unchanged, excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel.
ltl net revenues increased 39.3 percent to $360.7 million in 2015 from $258.9 million in 2014. freightquote contributed approximately 33 percentage points to our ltl net revenue growth in 2015. net revenue margin increased in 2015 as the result of a change in our freight mix with more small customers from the higher margin freightquote business. ltl volumes increased approximately 32 percent in 2015.
our intermodal net revenue increased 1.0 percent to $41.1 million in 2015 from $40.6 million in 2014. freightquote contributed approximately $3.4 million to our intermodal net revenues in 2015. conversion to truckload from intermodal negatively impacted intermodal volumes and net revenues throughout 2015. our intermodal net revenues declined throughout 2015 and that trend has continued into 2016.
our ocean transportation net revenues increased 7.3 percent to $223.6 million in 2015 from $208.4 million in 2014. the increase in net revenues was primarily due to increased net revenue margin and volumes.
our air transportation net revenues were unchanged at $79.1 million in 2015 from $79.1 million in 2014. this was the result of higher volumes offset by pricing declines.
our customs net revenues increased 5.7 percent to $43.9 million in 2015 from $41.6 million in 2014. the increase was due to increased transaction volumes.
other logistics services net revenues, which include managed services, warehousing, and small parcel, increased 12.9 percent to $82.5 million in 2015 from $73.1 million in 2014. the increase in 2015 was primarily due to growth in managed services as a result of adding new customers. freightquote contributed approximately two percentage points to our other logistics services net revenue growth in 2015.
sourcing net revenues increased 4.7 percent to $121.0 million in 2015 from $115.5 million in 2014. this increase was primarily due to an increase in case volumes, slightly offset by a decrease in net revenue per case. our net revenue margin increased to 8.1 percent in 2015 compared to 7.5 percent in 2014.
operating expenses. operating expenses increased 12.0 percent to $1.4 billion in 2015 from $1.3 billion in 2014. this was due to an increase of 12.0 percent in personnel expenses and an increase of 12.0 percent in other selling, general, and administrative expenses. as a percentage of net revenues, operating expenses decreased to 62.2 percent in 2015 from 62.7 percent in 2014.
our personnel expenses are driven by headcount and earnings growth. in 2015, personnel expenses increased to $1.1 billion from $0.9 billion in 2014. our personnel expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased in 2015 to 46.3 percent from 46.8 percent in 2014. the increase in personnel expense was due primarily to an increase in average headcount growth of approximately 14 percent in 2015. freightquote contributed approximately eight percentage points of the growth in average headcount during 2015. in addition, we experienced growth in expenses related to incentive plans that are designed to keep expenses variable with changes in net revenues and profitability.
other selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 12.0 percent to $358.8 million in 2015 from $320.2 million in 2014. the increase in our selling, general, and administrative expenses is primarily due to our acquisition of freightquote, including amortization expense of $7.6 million, and an increase in travel expenses.
income from operations. income from operations increased 14.7 percent to $858.3 million in 2015 from $748.4 million in 2014. income from operations as a percentage of net revenues increased to 37.8 percent in 2015 from 37.3 percent in 2014. this increase was due to our net revenues growing more than our operating expenses.
27
interest and other expense. interest and other expense was $35.5 million in 2015 compared to $25.0 million in 2014. during the fourth quarter, we wrote off an indemnification asset of $7.2 million related to the acquisition of phoenix as the indemnification obligations of the sellers expired. the impact of this write off was partially offset within the provision for income taxes by related tax liabilities that expired under applicable statute of limitations. in addition, we had a higher average outstanding balance on our short-term borrowings throughout 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the acquisition of freightquote.
provision for income taxes. our effective income tax rate was 38.1 percent for 2015 and 37.8 percent for 2014. the effective income tax rate for both periods is greater than the statutory federal income tax rate, primarily due to state income taxes, net of federal benefit.
net income. net income increased 13.3 percent to $509.7 million in 2015 from $449.7 million in 2014. basic net income per share increased 15.0 percent to $3.52 from $3.06 in 2014. diluted net income per share increased 15.1 percent to $3.51 from $3.05 in 2014.
2014 compared to 2013
total revenues and direct costs. our consolidated total revenues increased 5.6 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. total transportation revenues increased 7.7 percent to $11.9 billion in 2014 from $11.1 billion in 2013. this increase in transportation revenues was driven by higher volumes in nearly all of our transportation modes and increased pricing to our customers. total purchased transportation and related services increased 7.2 percent in 2014 to $10.0 billion from $9.4 billion in 2013. this increase was due to higher volumes in nearly all of our transportation modes and higher transportation costs. our sourcing revenue decreased 8.1 percent to $1.5 billion in 2014 from $1.7 billion in 2013. purchased products sourced for resale decreased 8.1 percent in 2014 to $1.4 billion from $1.5 billion in 2013. these decreases were primarily due to decreased case volumes and a change in customer, product, and service mix.
net revenues. total transportation net revenues increased 10.7 percent to $1.9 billion in 2014 from $1.7 billion in 2013. our transportation net revenue margin increased to 15.9 percent in 2014 from 15.4 percent in 2013, largely driven by an increase in transportation rates charged to our customers, partially offset by higher transportation costs.
our truckload net revenues increased 11.7 percent to $1.2 billion in 2014 from $1.1 billion in 2013. truckload volumes increased approximately 3 percent in 2014. truckload net revenue margin increased in 2014 due to increased rates charged to our customers, partially offset by increased cost of capacity. excluding the estimated impact of the change in fuel, on average, our truckload rates increased approximately 11 percent in 2014. our truckload transportation costs increased approximately 10 percent, excluding the estimated impacts of the change in fuel.
ltl net revenues increased 8.1 percent to $258.9 million in 2014 from $239.5 million in 2013. the increase in net revenues was driven by an increase in total shipments of approximately seven percent and increased customer pricing, partially offset by decreased net revenue margin.
our intermodal net revenue increase of 4.0 percent to $40.6 million in 2014 from $39.1 million in 2013 was driven largely by a change in the mix of business and improved customer pricing, partially offset by volume declines.
our ocean transportation net revenues increased 11.1 percent to $208.4 million in 2014 from $187.7 million in 2013. the increase in net revenues was primarily due to increased volumes and net revenue margin.
our air transportation net revenues increased 8.3 percent to $79.1 million in 2014 from $73.1 million in 2013. the increase was primarily due to increased net revenue margin and volumes.
our customs net revenues increased 13.7 percent to $41.6 million in 2014 from $36.6 million in 2013. the increase was due to increased transaction volumes.
other logistics services net revenues, which include managed services, warehousing, and small parcel, increased 7.6 percent to $73.1 million in 2014 from $67.9 million in 2013. the increase in 2014 was primarily due to growth in managed services as a result of adding new customers.
sourcing net revenues decreased 9.0 percent to $115.5 million in 2014 from $127.0 million in 2013. this decrease was primarily due to a change in customer, product, and service mix. our net revenue margin decreased to 7.5 percent in 2014 compared to 7.6 percent in 2013.
28
operating expenses. operating expenses increased 9.2 percent to $1.3 billion in 2014 from $1.2 billion in 2013. this was due to an increase of 13.6 percent in personnel expenses and a decrease of 2.0 percent in other selling, general, and administrative expenses. as a percentage of net revenues, operating expenses decreased to 62.7 percent in 2014 from 62.8 percent in 2013.
our personnel expenses are driven by headcount and earnings growth. in 2014, personnel expenses increased to $939.0 million from $826.7 million in 2013. our personnel expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased in 2014 to 46.8 percent from 45.0 percent in 2013. the increase in personnel expense was due primarily to an increase in expenses related to incentive plans that are designed to keep expenses variable with changes in net revenues and profitability, in addition to average headcount growth of 2.7 percent in 2014.
other selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased 2.0 percent to $320.2 million in 2014 from $326.8 million in 2013. the decrease in our selling, general, and administrative expenses is primarily related to decreases in claims and travel expenses.
income from operations. income from operations increased 9.6 percent to $748.4 million in 2014 from $682.7 million in 2013. income from operations as a percentage of net revenues increased to 37.3 percent in 2014 from 37.2 percent in 2013. this increase was due to our net revenues growing more than our operating expenses.
interest and other expense. interest and other expense was $25.0 million in 2014 compared to $9.3 million in 2013. the increase was due primarily to the interest expense related the long-term notes issued during the third quarter of 2013.
provision for income taxes. our effective income tax rate was 37.8 percent for 2014 and 38.2 percent for 2013. the effective income tax rate for both periods is greater than the statutory federal income tax rate, primarily due to state income taxes, net of federal benefit.
net income. net income increased 8.1 percent to $449.7 million in 2014 from $415.9 million in 2013. basic net income per share increased 15.5 percent to $3.06 from $2.65 in 2013. diluted net income per share increased 15.1 percent to $3.05 from $2.65 in 2013. our weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding decreased 6.2 percent and 6.1 percent respectively in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to the 8.5 million shares repurchased as part of accelerated share ("asr") repurchase program initiated in 2013.
liquidity and capital resources we have historically generated substantial cash from operations, which has enabled us to fund our growth while paying cash dividends and repurchasing stock. in december 2014, we amended our revolving credit facility to increase the amount available from $500 million to $900 million, to extend the expiration date from october 2017 to december 2019, and to revise a covenant ratio. in 2013, we entered into a note purchase agreement to fund the accelerated share repurchase agreements to repurchase $500 million worth of our common stock. the note purchase agreement was amended in february 2015 to conform its financial covenants to be consistent with the amended revolving credit facility. we also expect to use the revolving credit facility, and potentially other indebtedness incurred in the future, to assist us in continuing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, possible acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases. cash and cash equivalents totaled $168.2 million and $128.9 million as of december 31, 2015 and 2014. cash and cash equivalents held outside the united states totaled $114.3 million and $80.6 million  as of december 31, 2015 and 2014. working capital at december 31, 2015, was $282.1 million. working capital at december 31, 2014, was $529.6 million.
we prioritize our investments to grow the business, as we require some working capital and a relatively small amount of capital expenditures to grow. we are continually looking for acquisitions, but those acquisitions must fit our culture and enhance our growth opportunities.
cash flow from operating activities. we generated $718.3 million, $513.4 million, and $347.8 million of cash flow from operations in 2015, 2014, and 2013. the increase of $204.9 million in cash flow from operations in 2015 is primarily the result of a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in net income, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable. the decreases in accounts receivable and accounts payable are primarily the result of declining fuel prices.
cash used for investing activities. we used $54.4 million of cash in 2015, $388.9 million of cash in 2014, and $28.9 million of cash in 2013 for investing activities. our investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures and cash paid for acquisitions. on december 31, 2014, we funded $359.4 million of the purchase price for the acquisition of freightquote into escrow accounts pursuant to the purchase agreement and for completion of the acquisition in january 2015.
29
we used $44.6 million, $29.5 million, and $48.2 million of cash for capital expenditures in 2015, 2014, and 2013. we spent $26.0 million, $24.0 million,and $35.9 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013 primarily for annual investments in information technology equipment to support our operating systems, including the purchase and development of software. these information technology investments are intended to improve efficiencies and help grow the business. additionally, in 2014, we completed a new office building on our corporate campus in eden prairie, minnesota. this building was completed in the first quarter of 2014 and it replaced space we previously leased in eden prairie. the cost of the building was approximately $18.5 million, and the majority was funded in 2013.
we anticipate capital expenditures in 2016 to be approximately $70 million to $80 million. the increase is primarily the result of the planned construction of an additional data center, which is expected to be completed in 2016.
cash used for financing activities. we used $607.7 million, $143.6 million, and $364.9 million of cash flow for financing activities in 2015, 2014, and 2013.
we had net short-term repayments of $155.0 million in 2015 and net short-term borrowings of $230.0 million in 2014. on october 29, 2012, we entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility for up to $500 million with a $500 million accordion feature. in december of 2014, we amended this facility to increase the amount available from $500 million to $900 million, extended the expiration of the facility from october 2017 to december 2019, and revise a covenant ratio. this facility had $450.0 million outstanding as of december 31, 2015. the original purpose of this facility was to partially fund the acquisition of phoenix and will assist us in continuing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, possible acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases. advances under the facility carry an interest rate based on our total funded debt to total capitalization, as measured at the end of each quarter, and are based on a spread over libor for outstanding balances. in addition, there is a commitment fee on the average daily undrawn stated amount under each letter of credit issued under the facility. the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum fixed leverage ratio and minimum liquidity. we were in compliance with all of the credit facility's debt covenants as of december 31, 2015.
on august 23, 2013, we entered into a note purchase agreement for $500.0 million, of which the entire balance was outstanding as of december 31, 2015, and december 31, 2014. the primary purpose of this agreement was to fund the asr agreements that were entered into on august 24, 2013. the agreement contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum leverage ratio, an interest coverage ratio, and minimum liquidity. we were in compliance with all the covenants in the notes as of december 31, 2015. the note purchase agreement was amended in february 2015 to conform its financial covenants to be consistent with the amended revolving credit facility.
we used $235.6 million, $215.0 million, and $220.3 million to pay cash dividends in 2015, 2014, and 2013. the increase in 2015 was primarily the result of higher dividends paid compared to 2014. the decrease in 2014 was due to a decrease in the number of shares outstanding compared to 2013, primarily as a result of the accelerated share repurchases made in 2013.
we also used $229.9 million, $164.0 million, and $757.3 million on share repurchases in 2015, 2014, and 2013. in august 2013, the board of directors increased the number of shares authorized to be repurchased by 15,000,000 shares. as of december 31, 2015, there were 6,885,661 shares remaining for future repurchases. the number of shares we repurchase, if any, during future periods will vary based on our cash position, potential uses of our cash, and market conditions.
assuming no change in our current business plan, management believes that our available cash, together with expected future cash generated from operations, the amount available under our credit facility, and credit available in the market, will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital, capital expenditures, and cash dividends in future periods. we also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit or other forms of indebtedness on short notice, if needed.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all majority-owned subsidiaries. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions. in certain circumstances, those estimates and assumptions can affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes. in preparing our financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below. however, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. the following is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates.
30
revenue recognition. total revenues consist of the total dollar value of goods and services purchased from us by customers. net revenues are total revenues less the direct costs of transportation, products, and handling. we act principally as the service provider for these transactions and recognize revenue as these services are rendered or goods are delivered. at that time, our obligations to the transactions are completed and collection of receivables is reasonably assured. most transactions in our transportation and sourcing businesses are recorded at the gross amount we charge our customers for the service we provide and goods we sell. in these transactions, we are the primary obligor, we have credit risk, we have discretion to select the supplier, and we have latitude in pricing decisions.
additionally, in our sourcing business, we take loss of inventory risk during shipment and have general inventory risk. certain transactions in customs brokerage, managed services, freight forwarding, and sourcing are recorded at the net amount we charge our customers for the service we provide because many of the factors stated above are not present.
valuations for accounts receivable. our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based upon the aging of our receivables, our historical experience of uncollectible accounts, and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified. the allowance of $43.5 million as of december 31, 2015, increased compared to the allowance of $41.1 million as of december 31, 2014. this increase was primarily due to changes in the risk level of our accounts receivable portfolio. we believe that the recorded allowance is sufficient and appropriate based on our customer aging trends, the exposures we have identified, and our historical loss experience.
goodwill. we manage and report our operations as one operating segment. our network of offices represent a series of components that are aggregated for the purpose of evaluating goodwill for impairment on an enterprise-wide basis. the fair value of the enterprise-wide reporting unit substantially exceeds the book value; therefore we have determined that there is no goodwill impairment as of december 31, 2015.
stock-based compensation. we issue stock awards, including stock options, performance shares, and restricted stock units, to key employees and outside directors. in general, the awards vest over five years, either based on the company's earnings growth or the passage of time. the fair value of each share-based payment award is established on the date of grant. for grants of restricted shares and restricted units, the fair value is established based on the market price on the date of the grant, discounted for post-vesting holding restrictions. the discounts on outstanding grants vary from 17 percent to 22 percent and are calculated using the black-scholes option pricing model. changes in the measured stock price volatility and interest rates are the primary reason for changes in the discount. for grants of options, we use the black-scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the awards. the determination of the fair value is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends.
disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial contingencies the following table aggregates all contractual commitments and commercial obligations, due by period, that affect our financial condition and liquidity position as of december 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):

_______________________
(1)   amounts payable relate to the semi-annual interest due on the long-term notes and the principal amount at maturity.
(2)   we have certain facilities and equipment under operating leases.
(3)   purchase obligations include agreements for services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. as of december 31, 2015, such obligations include ocean and air freight capacity, telecommunications services, and maintenance contracts.
31
we have no capital lease obligations. long-term liabilities consist of noncurrent income taxes payable, long-term notes payable, and the obligation under our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december 31, 2015, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority. therefore, $19.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes. the obligation under our non-qualified deferred compensation plan has also been excluded from the above table as the timing of cash payment is uncertain. as of december 31, 2015, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of sec regulation s-k.

the terms and conditions of service, including electric and gas rates, of the utility operating companies and system energy are determined through regulatory approval proceedings that are lengthy and subject to appeal that could result in delays in effecting rate changes and uncertainty as to ultimate results.
the rates that the utility operating companies and system energy charge reflect their capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, allowed rates of return, financing costs, and related costs of service. these rates significantly influence the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of entergy and each of the utility operating companies and system energy. these rates are determined in regulatory proceedings and are subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment.
in addition, regulators can initiate proceedings to investigate the prudence of costs in the utility operating companies' base rates and examine, among other things, the reasonableness or prudence of the companies' operation and maintenance practices, level of expenditures (including storm costs and costs associated with capital projects), allowed rates of return and rate base, proposed resource acquisitions, and previously incurred capital expenditures that the operating companies seek to place in rates. the regulators can disallow costs subject to their jurisdiction found not to have been prudently incurred or found not to have been incurred in compliance with applicable tariffs, creating some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. regulatory proceedings relating to rates and other matters typically involve multiple parties seeking to limit or reduce rates. traditional base rate proceedings, as opposed to formula rate plans, generally have long timelines, are primarily based on historical costs, and may or may not be limited in scope or duration by statute. the length of these base rate proceedings can cause the utility operating companies and system energy to experience regulatory lag in recovering costs through rates. decisions are typically subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with rate case proceedings.
the base rates of entergy texas are established in traditional base rate case proceedings. entergy texas also has filed to use rate riders to recover the revenue requirements associated with distribution-related capital investments and transmission-related capital investments and certain miso charges.
between base rate cases, entergy arkansas and entergy mississippi are able to adjust base rates annually through formula rate plans that utilize forward test years. in its pending application for a general change in rates, entergy arkansas notified the apsc that it is electing to have its rates regulated under a formula rate review mechanism pursuant to legislation enacted by the arkansas general assembly in early 2015. entergy arkansas submitted a formula rate plan tariff with a projected year test period and an initial five-year term for approval by the apsc. the initial five-year term expires in 2021 unless entergy arkansas requests, and the apsc approves, the extension of the formula rate plan tariff for an additional five years through 2026. in the event that entergy arkansas' formula rate plan is terminated or is not extended beyond the initial term, entergy arkansas could file an application for a general change in rates that may include a request for continued regulation under a formula rate review mechanism. if entergy mississippi's formula rate plan is terminated, it would revert to the more traditional rate case environment or seek approval of a new formula rate plan. entergy arkansas and entergy mississippi recover fuel and purchased energy and certain non-fuel costs through other apsc-approved and mpsc-
approved tariffs, respectively.

table of contents entergy louisiana sets electric base rates annually through a formula rate plan using an historic test year. the form of the formula rate plan, on a combined basis, was approved in connection with the business combination of entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana and largely followed the formula rate plans that were approved by the lpsc in connection with the full electric base rate cases filed by those companies in february 2013. the formula rate plan is approved for continued use through the test year 2016 filing. entergy louisiana's electric formula rate plan increases are capped at a cumulative total of $30 million through the formula rate plan cycle.
the lpsc also approved in the business combination entergy louisiana's continuation of a mechanism to recover non-
fuel miso-related costs, which are calculated separately from the formula rate plan requirements, but embedded in the formula rate plan factor applied on customer bills. this recovery mechanism expires following the 2015 test year and is subject to review for renewal by the lpsc. miso fuel and energy-related costs are recoverable in entergy louisiana's fuel adjustment clause. the formula rate plan retains exceptions from the rate cap/restrictions and sharing requirements for certain large capital investment projects, including the ninemile 6 generating facility. in the event that the electric formula rate plans were terminated, or expired without renewal or extension, entergy louisiana would at that time revert to the more traditional rate case environment.
entergy new orleans previously operated under a formula rate plan that ended with the 2011 test year. currently, based on a settlement agreement approved by the city council, with limited exceptions, no action may be taken with respect to entergy new orleans' base rates until rates are implemented from a base rate case that must be filed for its electric and gas operations in 2018. the limited exceptions include continued implementation of the remaining two years of a four-year phased-in rate increase for its recently acquired algiers operations in the fifteenth ward of the city of new orleans and certain exceptional cost increases or decreases in its base revenue requirement.
the utility operating companies and system energy, and the energy industry as a whole, have experienced a period of rising costs and investments, and an upward trend in spending, especially with respect to infrastructure investments, which is likely to continue in the foreseeable future and could result in more frequent rate cases and requests for, and the continuation of, cost recovery mechanisms. for information regarding rate case proceedings and formula rate plans applicable to the utility operating companies, see note 2 to the financial statements.
the utility operating companies recover fuel, purchased power, and associated costs through rate mechanisms that are subject to risks of delay or disallowance in regulatory proceedings.
the utility operating companies recover their fuel, purchased power, and associated costs from their customers through rate mechanisms subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment. because regulatory review can result in the disallowance of incurred costs found not to have been prudently incurred with the possibility of refunds to ratepayers, there exists some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. regulators can also initiate proceedings to investigate the continued usage or the adequacy and operation of the fuel and purchased power recovery clauses of the utility operating companies and, therefore, there can be no assurance that existing recovery mechanisms will remain unchanged or in effect at all.
the utility operating companies' cash flows can be negatively affected by the time delays between when gas, power, or other commodities are purchased and the ultimate recovery from customers of the costs in rates. on occasion, when the level of incurred costs for fuel and purchased power rises very dramatically, some of the utility operating companies may agree to defer recovery of a portion of that period's fuel and purchased power costs for recovery at a later date, which could increase the near-term working capital and borrowing requirements of those companies. for a description of fuel and purchased power recovery mechanisms and information regarding the regulatory proceedings for fuel and purchased power costs recovery, see note 2 to the financial statements.
there is uncertainty regarding the effect of the termination of the system agreement on the utility operating companies.
the utility operating companies historically have engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating resources and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of the system agreement, which is a rate schedule that has been approved by the ferc.

there is uncertainty regarding the effect of the termination of the system agreement on the utility operating companies because of the significant effect of the agreement on the generation and transmission functions of the utility operating companies and the significant period of time (over 30 years) that it has been in existence. in the absence of the system agreement, there is uncertainty around governance processes and the potential absence of federal authority to resolve certain issues among the utility operating companies and their retail regulators.
in addition, although the system agreement will terminate in its entirety in august 2016, there are a number of outstanding system agreement proceedings at the ferc that may require future adjustments, including challenges to the level and timing of payments made by entergy arkansas under the system agreement. the outcome and timing of these ferc proceedings and resulting recovery and impact on rates cannot be predicted at this time.

a delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred as a result of severe weather could have material effects on entergy and those utility operating companies affected by severe weather.
entergy's and its utility operating companies' results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition can be materially affected by the destructive effects of severe weather. severe weather can also result in significant outages for the customers of the utility operating companies and, therefore, reduced revenues for the utility operating companies during the period of the outages. a delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred or revenues lost as a result of severe weather could have a material effect on entergy and those utility operating companies affected by severe weather.

certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities must consistently operate their nuclear power plants at high capacity factors in order to be successful, and lower capacity factors could materially affect entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
nuclear capacity factors significantly affect the results of operations of certain utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities. nuclear plant operations involve substantial fixed operating costs. consequently, to be successful, a plant owner must consistently operate its nuclear power plants at high capacity factors. for the utility operating companies that own nuclear plants, lower capacity factors can increase production costs by requiring the affected companies to generate additional energy, sometimes at higher costs, from their fossil facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy their supply needs. for the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plants, lower capacity factors directly affect revenues and cash flow from operations. entergy wholesale commodities' forward sales are comprised of various hedge products, many of which have some degree of operational-contingent price risk. certain unit-contingent contracts guarantee specified minimum capacity factors. in the event plants with these contracts were operating below the guaranteed capacity factors, entergy would be subject to price risk for the undelivered power. further, entergy wholesale commodities' nuclear forward sales contracts can also be on a firm ld basis, which subjects entergy to increasing price risk as capacity factors decrease. many of these firm hedge products have damages risk, capped through the use of risk management products.
certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plant owners periodically shut down their nuclear power plants to replenish fuel. plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such refueling outages. if refueling outages last longer than anticipated or if unplanned outages arise, entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected.
outages at nuclear power plants to replenish fuel require the plant to be "turned off." refueling outages generally are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months and average approximately 30 days in duration. plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such planned outages. when refueling outages last longer than anticipated or a plant experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease and maintenance costs may increase. lower than forecasted capacity factors may cause entergy wholesale commodities to experience reduced revenues and may also create damages risk with certain hedge products as previously discussed.

table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities face risks related to the purchase of uranium fuel (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication), and the risk of being unable to effectively manage these risks by purchasing from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries could materially affect entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
based upon currently planned fuel cycles, entergy's nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what entergy believes are reasonably predictable prices through most of 2016 and beyond. the nuclear fuel supply portfolio for the entergy wholesale commodities segment is being adjusted to reflect reduced overall requirements related to the planned permanent shutdown of the fitzpatrick and pilgrim plants and the recent shutdown of the vermont yankee plant
.
entergy's ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices, however, depends upon the performance reliability of uranium miners and enrichers. while there are a number of possible alternate suppliers that may be accessed to mitigate any supplier performance failure, the pricing of any such alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium supply at that time. entergy also may draw upon its own inventory intended for later generation periods, depending upon its risk management strategy at that time. entergy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the u.s. market prices for nuclear fuel have been extremely volatile from time to time in the past. although entergy's nuclear fuel contract portfolio provides a degree of hedging against market risks for several years, costs for nuclear fuel in the future cannot be predicted with certainty due to normal inherent market uncertainties, and price increases could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities.
entergy's ability to assure nuclear fuel supply also depends upon the performance and reliability of conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services providers. these service providers are fewer in number than uranium suppliers.
for conversion and enrichment services, entergy diversifies its supply by supplier and country and may take special measures to ensure a reliable supply of enriched uranium for fabrication into nuclear fuel. for fabrication services, each plant is dependent upon the performance of the fabricator of that plant's nuclear fuel; therefore, entergy relies upon additional monitoring, inspection, and oversight of the fabrication process to assure reliability and quality of its nuclear fuel. certain of the suppliers and service providers are located in or dependent upon countries, such as russia, in which deteriorating economic conditions or international sanctions could restrict the ability of such suppliers to continue to supply fuel or provide such services. the inability of such suppliers or service providers to perform such obligations could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities.
entergy arkansas, entergy louisiana, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business face the risk that the nrc will change or modify its regulations, suspend or revoke their licenses, or increase oversight of their nuclear plants, which could materially affect entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
under the atomic energy act and energy reorganization act, the nrc regulates the operation of nuclear power plants.
the nrc may modify, suspend, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the atomic energy act, related regulations, or the terms of the licenses for nuclear facilities. a change in the atomic energy act, other applicable statutes, or the applicable regulations or licenses, or the nrc's interpretation thereof, may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or may result in increased operating or decommissioning costs and could materially affect the results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition of entergy (through entergy wholesale commodities), its utility operating companies, or system energy. a change in the classification of a plant owned by one of these companies under the nrc's reactor oversight process, which is the nrc's program to collect information about plant performance, assess the information for its safety significance, and provide for appropriate licensee and nrc response, also could cause the owner of the plant to incur material additional costs as a result of the increased oversight activity and potential response costs associated with the change in classification. for additional information concerning the current classification of the plants owned by entergy

events at nuclear plants owned by one of these companies, as well as those owned by others, may lead to a change in laws or regulations or the terms of the applicable licenses, or the nrc's interpretation thereof, or may cause the nrc to increase oversight activity or initiate actions to modify, suspend, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility, or impose civil penalties. as a result, if an incident were to occur at any nuclear generating unit, whether an entergy nuclear generating unit or not, it could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of entergy, certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, or entergy wholesale commodities. for example, the earthquake of march 11, 2011 that affected the fukushima daiichi nuclear plants in japan resulted in the nrc issuing three orders effective on march 12, 2012 requiring u.s. nuclear operators, including entergy, to undertake plant modifications or perform additional analyses that, among other things, have resulted in increased capital and operating costs associated with operating entergy's nuclear plants, some of which have been and will be material.
certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities are exposed to risks and costs related to operating and maintaining their nuclear power plants, and their failure to maintain operational efficiency at their nuclear power plants could materially affect entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
the nuclear generating units owned by certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business began commercial operations in the 1970s-1980s. older equipment may require more capital expenditures to keep each of these nuclear power plants operating efficiently. this equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement. any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages, or any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in reduced profitability.
operations at any of the nuclear generating units owned and operated by entergy's subsidiaries could degrade to the point where the affected unit needs to be shut down or operated at less than full capacity. if this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and expense. a decision may be made to close a unit rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the unit to full capacity. for entergy wholesale commodities, this could result in lost revenue and increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments and penalties for failure to perform under their contracts with customers. the nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking of certain materials within the reactor coolant system. the issue is applicable at all nuclear units to varying degrees and is managed in accordance with industry standard practices and guidelines that include in-service examinations, replacements, and mitigation strategies.
developments in the industry or identification of issues at the nuclear units could require unanticipated remediation efforts that cannot be quantified in advance.
moreover, entergy is becoming more dependent on fewer suppliers for key parts of entergy's nuclear power plants that may need to be replaced or refurbished. in addition, certain major parts have long lead-times to manufacture if an unplanned replacement is needed. this dependence on a reduced number of suppliers and long lead-times on certain major parts for unplanned replacements could result in delays in obtaining qualified replacement parts and, therefore, greater expense for entergy.
the costs associated with the storage of the spent nuclear fuel of certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and the owners of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants, as well as the costs of and their ability to fully decommission their nuclear power plants, could be significantly affected by the timing of the opening of a spent nuclear fuel disposal facility, as well as interim storage and transportation requirements.
certain of the utility operating companies, system energy and the owners of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plants incur costs on a periodic basis for the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. the approval of a license for a national repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, such as the one proposed for yucca mountain, nevada, or any interim storage facility, and the timing of such facility opening, will significantly affect the costs
281
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy associated with on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. for example, while the doe is required by law to proceed with the licensing of yucca mountain and, after the license is granted by the nrc, to construct the repository and commence the receipt of spent fuel, the obama administration has expressed its intention and taken specific steps to discontinue the yucca mountain project and study a new spent fuel strategy. the nrc licensing of the yucca mountain repository is effectively at a standstill. these actions may prolong the time before spent fuel is removed from entergy's plant sites. because the doe has not accomplished its objectives, it is in non-compliance with the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts, and entergy has sued the doe for such breach. furthermore, entergy is uncertain as to when the doe plans to commence acceptance of spent fuel from its facilities for storage or disposal. as a result, continuing future expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at the companies' nuclear sites. the costs of on-site storage are also affected by regulatory requirements for such storage. in addition, the availability of a repository or other off-
site storage facility for spent nuclear fuel may affect the ability to fully decommission the nuclear units and the costs relating to decommissioning. for further information regarding spent fuel storage, see the "

certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to pay substantial retrospective premiums imposed under the price-anderson act in the event of a nuclear incident, and losses not covered by insurance could have a material effect on entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.
accidents and other unforeseen problems at nuclear power plants have occurred both in the united states and elsewhere. the price-anderson act limits each reactor owner's public liability (off-site) for a single nuclear incident to the payment of retrospective premiums into a secondary insurance pool of up to approximately $127.318
million per reactor. with 103 reactors currently participating, this translates to a total public liability cap of approximately $13.114 billion per incident. the limit is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation, a change in the primary limit of insurance coverage, and changes in the number of licensed reactors. as required by the price-anderson act, the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities carry the maximum available amount of primary nuclear off-site liability insurance with american nuclear insurers (currently
$375 million for each operating site). claims for any nuclear incident exceeding that amount are covered under the retrospective premiums paid into the secondary insurance pool. as a result, in the event of a nuclear incident that causes damages (off-site) in excess of the $375 million in primary insurance coverage, each owner of a nuclear plant reactor, including entergy's utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities plant owners, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident, will be required to pay a retrospective premium, equal to its proportionate share of the loss in excess of the $375 million primary level, up to a maximum of $127.318 million per reactor per incident (entergy's maximum total contingent obligation per incident is $1.4
billion). the retrospective premium payment is currently limited to $18.963 million per year per incident per reactor until the aggregate public liability for each licensee is paid up to the $127.318 million cap.
neil is a utility industry mutual insurance company, owned by its members. all member plants could be subject to an annual assessment (retrospective premium of up to 10 times current annual premium for all policies) should the surplus (reserve) be significantly depleted due to insured losses. as of april 1, 2015, the maximum annual assessment amounts total $124 million for the utility plants and $127.7 million for the entergy wholesale commodities plants. retrospective premium insurance available through neil's reinsurance treaty can cover the potential assessments. the entergy wholesale commodities plants currently maintain the retrospective premium insurance to cover this potential assessment.
as an owner of nuclear power plants, entergy participates in industry self-insurance programs and could be liable to fund claims should a plant owned by a different company experience a major event. any resulting liability from a nuclear accident may exceed the applicable primary insurance coverage and require contribution of additional funds through the industry-wide program that could significantly affect the results of operations, financial condition,

market performance and other changes may decrease the value of assets in the decommissioning trusts, which then could require significant additional funding.
owners of nuclear generating plants have an obligation to decommission those plants. certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and owners of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants maintain decommissioning trust funds for this purpose. certain of the utility operating companies collect funds from their customers, which are deposited into the trusts covering the units operated for or on behalf of those companies.
those rate collections are based upon operating license lives as well as estimated trust fund earnings and decommissioning costs. in connection with the acquisition of certain nuclear plants, the entergy wholesale commodities plant owners also acquired decommissioning trust funds that are funded in accordance with nrc regulations. assets in these trust funds are subject to market fluctuations, will yield uncertain returns that may fall below projected return rates, and may result in losses resulting from the recognition of impairments of the value of certain securities held in these trust funds. as part of the pilgrim, indian point 1 and 2, vermont yankee, and palisades/big rock point purchases, the former owners transferred decommissioning trust funds, along with the liability to decommission the plants, to the respective entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plant owners. in addition, the former owner of indian point 3 and fitzpatrick retained the decommissioning trusts and related liability to decommission these plants, but has the right to require the respective entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plant owners to assume the decommissioning liability provided that it assigns the funds in the corresponding decommissioning trust, up to a specified level, to such owners. alternatively, the former owner may contract with entergy nuclear, inc. for the decommissioning work at a price equal to the funds in the corresponding decommissioning trust up to a specified amount. as part of the indian point 1 and 2 purchase, the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plant owner also funded an additional $25 million to a supplemental decommissioning trust fund. as part of the palisades transaction, the entergy wholesale commodities business assumed responsibility for spent fuel at the decommissioned big rock point nuclear plant, which is located near charlevoix, michigan. once the spent fuel is removed from the site, the entergy wholesale commodities business will dismantle the spent fuel storage facility and complete site decommissioning. the entergy wholesale commodities business expects to fund this activity from operating revenue, and entergy is providing $5 million in credit support to provide financial assurance to the nrc for this obligation.
in 2008, entergy experienced declines in the market value of assets held in the trust funds for meeting its decommissioning funding assurance obligations for its plants. this decline adversely affected entergy's ability to demonstrate compliance with the nrc's requirements for providing financial assurance for decommissioning funding for some of its plants, which deficiencies have now been corrected. an early plant shutdown, poor investment results or higher than anticipated decommissioning costs could cause trust fund assets to be insufficient to meet the decommissioning obligations, with the result that the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. for further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, see the "

changes in nrc regulations or other binding regulatory requirements may cause increased funding requirements for nuclear plant decommissioning trusts.
nrc regulations require certain minimum financial assurance requirements for meeting obligations to decommission nuclear power plants. those financial assurance requirements may change from time to time, and certain changes may result in a material increase in the financial assurance required for decommissioning the utility operating companies', system energy's and owners of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants. such changes could result in the need for additional contributions to decommissioning trusts, or the posting of parent guarantees, letters of credit, or other surety mechanisms. for further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, see the "

new or existing safety concerns regarding operating nuclear power plants and nuclear fuel could lead to restrictions upon the operation of entergy's nuclear power plants.
new and existing concerns are being expressed in public forums about the safety of nuclear generating units and nuclear fuel, in particular in the northeastern united states, which is where five of the six units in the current fleet of entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants are located. these concerns have led to, and are expected to continue to lead to, various proposals to federal regulators and governing bodies in some localities where entergy's subsidiaries own nuclear generating units for legislative and regulatory changes that could lead to the shutdown of nuclear units, denial of license renewal applications, restrictions on nuclear units as a result of unavailability of sites for spent nuclear fuel storage and disposal, or other adverse effects on owning and operating nuclear generating units. entergy vigorously responds to these concerns and proposals. if any of the existing proposals, or any proposals that may arise in the future with respect to legislative and regulatory changes, become effective, they could have a material effect on entergy's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
(entergy corporation)
a failure to obtain renewed licenses or other approvals required for the continued operation of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants could have a material effect on entergy's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and could lead to an increase in depreciation rates or an acceleration of the timing for the funding of decommissioning obligations.
the license renewal and related processes for the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants have been and may continue to be the subject of significant public debate and regulatory and legislative review and scrutiny at the federal and, in certain cases, state level. the original expiration date of the operating license for indian point 2 was september 2013 and the original expiration date of the operating license for indian point 3 was december 2015. because these plants filed timely license renewal applications, the nrc's rules provide that these plants may continue to operate under their existing operating licenses until their renewal applications have been finally determined. various parties have expressed opposition to renewal of these licenses. renewal of the indian point licenses is the subject of ongoing proceedings before the atomic safety and licensing board (aslb) of the nrc and, with respect to issues resolved by the aslb, before the nrc on appeal.
in relation to indian point 2 and indian point 3, the new york state department of environmental conservation has taken the position that these plant owners must obtain a new state-issued clean water act section 401 water quality certification as part of the license renewal process. in addition, before the nrc may issue renewed operating licenses it must resolve its obligation to address the requirements of the coastal zone management act (czma). for further information regarding these environmental regulations see the "

if the nrc finally denies the applications for the renewal of operating licenses for one or more of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants, or a state in which any such nuclear power plant is located is able to prevent the continued operation of such plant, entergy's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected by loss of revenue and cash flow associated with the plant or plants, potential impairments of the carrying value of the plants, increased depreciation rates, and an accelerated need for decommissioning funds, which could require additional funding. in addition, entergy may incur increased operating costs depending on any conditions that may be imposed in connection with license renewal. for further discussion regarding the license renewal processes for the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants, see the "

" in entergy corporation and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis.
the decommissioning trust fund assets for the nuclear power plants owned by entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plant owners may not be adequate to meet decommissioning obligations if one or more of their nuclear power plants is retired earlier than the anticipated shutdown date, the plants cost more to decommission than estimated, or if current regulatory requirements change, which then could require additional funding.
under nrc regulations, entergy wholesale commodities' nuclear subsidiaries are permitted to project the nrc-
required decommissioning amount, based on an nrc formula or a site-specific estimate, and the amount in each of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plant's decommissioning trusts combined with other decommissioning financial assurances in place. the projections are made based on the operating license expiration date and the mid-
point of the subsequent decommissioning process, or the anticipated actual completion of decommissioning if a site-
specific estimate is used, for each of these nuclear power plants. as a result, if the projected amount of individual plants' decommissioning trusts exceeds the nrc-required decommissioning amount, then its decommissioning obligations are considered to be funded in accordance with nrc regulations. if the projected costs do not sufficiently reflect the actual costs the applicable entergy subsidiaries would be required to incur to decommission these nuclear power plants, and funding is otherwise inadequate, or if the formula or site-specific estimate is changed to require increased funding, additional resources would be required. furthermore, depending upon the level of funding available in the trust funds, the nrc may not permit the trust funds to be used to pay for related costs such as the management of spent nuclear fuel that are not included in the nrc's formula. the nrc may also require a plan for the provision of separate funding for spent fuel management costs. in addition to nrc requirements, there are other decommissioning-related obligations for certain of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants, which management believes it will be able to satisfy.
if any entergy wholesale commodities subsidiary decides to shut down one of its nuclear power plants earlier than the scheduled shutdown date and conduct decommissioning without the full benefit of a safe storage period, the applicable entergy subsidiary may be unable to rely upon only the decommissioning trust to fund the entire decommissioning obligations, which would require it to obtain funding from other sources.
vermont yankee submitted notification of permanent cessation of operations and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor in january 2015 after final shutdown in december 2014. the post shutdown decommissioning activities report for vermont yankee, including a site specific cost estimate, was submitted to the nrc in december 2014. vermont yankee's future certifications to satisfy the nrc's financial assurance requirements will now be based on the site specific cost estimate, including the estimated cost of managing spent fuel, rather than the nrc minimum formula for estimating decommissioning costs. entergy expects that amounts available in vermont yankee's decommissioning trust fund, including expected earnings, together with the credit facilities entered into in january 2015 that are expected to be repaid with recoveries from doe litigation related to spent fuel storage, will be sufficient to cover expected costs of decommissioning, spent fuel management costs, and site restoration. future nrc filings will determine whether any other financial assurance may be required, including additional funding for spent fuel management, which will be required until the federal government takes possession of the fuel and removes it from the site, per its current obligation. in june 2015 the nrc granted an exemption allowing use of decommissioning trust funds for spent fuel management activities. in august 2015, vermont and two vermont utilities filed a petition in the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit challenging the nrc's issuance of that exemption. if the appeal were to result in a final decision denying vermont yankee the exemption, vermont yankee would have to satisfy the nrc that it had a plan to obtain additional funds to enable it to pay for these costs until the federal government takes possession of the fuel and removes it from the site.
further, federal or state regulatory changes, including mandated increases in decommissioning funding or changes in the methods or standards for decommissioning operations, may also increase the funding requirements of, or accelerate the timing for funding of, the obligations related to the decommissioning of entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants or may restrict the decommissioning-related costs that can be paid from the

entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants are exposed to price risk.
entergy and its subsidiaries do not have a regulator-authorized rate of return on their capital investments in non-
utility businesses. in particular, the sale of capacity and energy from the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants, unless otherwise contracted, is subject to the fluctuation of market power prices. in order to reduce future price risk to desired levels, entergy wholesale commodities utilizes contracts that are unit-contingent and firm ld and various products such as forward sales, options, and collars. as of december 31, 2015, entergy wholesale commodities' nuclear power generation plants had sold forward 86%, 63%, 21%, 26%, and 27% of its generation portfolio's planned energy output for 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.
market conditions such as product cost, market liquidity, and other portfolio considerations influence the product and contractual mix. the obligations under unit-contingent agreements depend on a generating asset that is operating; if the generation asset is not operating, the seller generally is not liable for damages. for some unit-
contingent obligations, however, there is also a guarantee of availability that provides for the payment to the power purchaser of contract damages, if incurred, in the event the unit owner fails to deliver power as a result of the failure of the specified generation unit to generate power at or above a specified availability threshold. firm ld sales transactions may be exposed to substantial operational price risk, a portion of which may be capped through the use of risk management products, to the extent that the plants do not run as expected and market prices exceed contract prices.
market prices may fluctuate substantially, sometimes over relatively short periods of time, and at other times experience sustained increases or decreases. demand for electricity and its fuel stock can fluctuate dramatically, creating periods of substantial under- or over-supply. during periods of over-supply, prices might be depressed.
also, from time to time there may be political pressure, or pressure from regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over wholesale and retail energy commodity and transportation rates, to impose price limitations, credit requirements, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address volatility and other issues in these markets.
the effects of sustained low natural gas prices and power market structure challenges have resulted in lower market prices for electricity in the power regions where the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants are located. the market price trend presents a challenging economic situation for the entergy wholesale commodities plants. the severity of the challenge varies for each of the plants based on a variety of factors such as their market for both energy and capacity, their size, their contracted positions, and the amount of investment required to continue to operate and maintain the safety and integrity of the plants, including the estimated asset retirement costs. in addition, currently the market design under which the plants operate does not adequately compensate merchant nuclear plants for their environmental and fuel diversity benefits in the region.
the price that different counterparties offer for various products including forward sales is influenced both by market conditions as well as the contract terms such as damage provisions, credit support requirements, and the number of available counterparties interested in contracting for the desired forward period. depending on differences between market factors at the time of contracting versus current conditions, entergy wholesale commodities' contract portfolio may have average contract prices above or below current market prices, including at the expiration of the contracts, which may significantly affect entergy wholesale commodities' results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. new hedges are generally layered into on a rolling forward basis, which tends to drive hedge over-performance to market in a falling price environment, and hedge underperformance to market in a rising price environment; however, hedge timing, product choice, and hedging costs will also affect these results. see the "

- realized revenue per mwh for entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plants " section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy corporation and subsidiaries. since the operating licenses for indian point 2
and indian point 3 expired in 2013 and 2015, respectively (see discussion above regarding the continued operation of indian point 2 and 3 past the license expiration dates), and as a consequence of any delays in obtaining extension of the operating licenses and any other approvals required for continued operation of the plants, entergy wholesale commodities may
286
table of contents enter into fewer unit-contingent forward sales contracts for output from such plants for periods beyond the license expiration.
among the factors that could affect market prices for electricity and fuel, all of which are beyond entergy's control to a significant degree, are:
prevailing market prices for natural gas, uranium (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication), coal,
•  oil, and other fuels used in electric generation plants, including associated transportation costs, and supplies of such commodities;
•  seasonality and realized weather deviations compared to normalized weather forecasts;
•  availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources and the requirements of a renewable portfolio standard;
•  changes in production and storage levels of natural gas, lignite, coal and crude oil, and refined products;
•  liquidity in the general wholesale electricity market, including the number of creditworthy counterparties available and interested in entering into forward sales agreements for entergy's full hedging term;
the actions of external parties, such as the ferc and local independent system operators and other state or
•  federal energy regulatory bodies, that may impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in the energy markets;
•  electricity transmission, competing generation or fuel transportation constraints, inoperability, or inefficiencies;
•  the general demand for electricity, which may be significantly affected by national and regional economic conditions;
•  weather conditions affecting demand for electricity or availability of hydroelectric power or fuel supplies;
•  the rate of growth in demand for electricity as a result of population changes, regional economic conditions, and the implementation of conservation programs or distributed generation;
•  regulatory policies of state agencies that affect the willingness of entergy wholesale commodities customers to enter into long-term contracts generally, and contracts for energy in particular;
increases in supplies due to actions of current entergy wholesale commodities competitors or new market
•  entrants, including the development of new generation facilities, expansion of existing generation facilities, the disaggregation of vertically integrated utilities, and improvements in transmission that allow additional supply to reach entergy wholesale commodities' nuclear markets;
•  union and labor relations;
changes in federal and state energy and environmental laws and regulations and other initiatives, including
•  but not limited to, the price impacts of proposed emission controls such as the regional greenhouse gas initiative (rggi);
•  changes in law resulting from federal or state energy legislation or legislation subjecting energy derivatives used in hedging and risk management transactions to governmental regulation; and
•  natural disasters, terrorist actions, wars, embargoes, and other catastrophic events.
the entergy wholesale commodities business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by legislative, regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements.
the entergy wholesale commodities business is subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulation.
compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause the entergy wholesale commodities business to incur significant additional costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines and/or civil or criminal liability.
public utilities under the federal power act are required to obtain ferc acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity. each of the owners of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants that generates electricity, as well as entergy nuclear power marketing, llc, is a "public utility" under the federal power act by virtue of making wholesale sales of electric energy and/or owning wholesale electric transmission facilities. the ferc has granted these generating and power marketing companies the authority to sell electricity at
287
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy market-based rates. the ferc's orders that grant the entergy wholesale commodities' generating and power marketing companies market-based rate authority reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if the ferc subsequently determines that the entergy wholesale commodities business can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. in addition, the entergy wholesale commodities' market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules, and if any of its generating and power marketing companies were deemed to have violated one of those rules, they would be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority and potential penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation. if the entergy wholesale commodities'
generating or power marketing companies were to lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to obtain the ferc's acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting, record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules. this could have an adverse effect on the rates the entergy wholesale commodities business charges for power from its facilities.
the entergy wholesale commodities business is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations, and bidding rules imposed by the existing independent system operators. the independent system operators that oversee most of the wholesale power markets impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps and other mechanisms, to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in these markets. these types of price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may have an adverse effect on the profitability of the entergy wholesale commodities business' generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets. for further information regarding federal, state and local laws and regulation applicable to the entergy wholesale commodities business, see the "
regulation of entergy's business
" section in part i, item 1.
the regulatory environment applicable to the electric power industry has undergone substantial changes over the past several years as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state and federal levels. these changes are ongoing and entergy cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on the entergy wholesale commodities business. in addition, in some of these markets, interested parties have proposed material market design changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price mechanism and have raised claims that the competitive marketplace is not working because energy prices in wholesale markets exceed the marginal cost of operating nuclear power plants, as well as proposals to re-regulate the markets, impose a generation tax, or require divestitures by generating companies to reduce their market share. other proposals to re-regulate may be made and legislative or other attention to the electric power market restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation process, which could require material changes to business planning models. if competitive restructuring of the electric power markets is reversed, modified, discontinued, or delayed, the entergy wholesale commodities business' results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected.
the power plants owned by the entergy wholesale commodities business are subject to impairment charges in certain circumstances, which could have a material effect on entergy's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
entergy reviews long-lived assets held in all of its business segments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that recoverability of these assets is uncertain. generally, the determination of recoverability is based on the undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from the operations of such assets. projected net cash flows depend on the future operating costs associated with the assets, the efficiency and availability of the assets and generating units, and the future market and price for energy and capacity over the remaining life of the assets. in particular, the assets of the entergy wholesale commodities business are subject to impairment if adverse market conditions arise and continue (such as expected long-term declines in market prices for electricity), if adverse regulatory events occur (including with respect to environmental regulation), if there is a reduction in the expected remaining useful life of a unit, if a unit ceases operation or if a unit's operating license is not renewed. moreover, the failure of the entergy wholesale commodities business to achieve forecasted operating results and cash flows, an unfavorable change in forecasted operating results or cash flows, or a decline in observable industry market multiples could all result in potential impairment charges for the affected assets.

" section in part i, item 1, the original expiration dates of the operating licenses for indian point 2 and indian point 3 were 2013 and 2015, respectively (see discussion above regarding the continued operation of indian point 2
and 3 past the license expiration dates),and are currently the subject of license renewal processes at the nrc and the state in which the plants operate. on august 27, 2013, entergy announced its plan to close and decommission vermont yankee. vermont yankee ceased power production in the fourth quarter 2014 at the end of a fuel cycle. this decision was approved by the board in august 2013, and resulted in the recognition of impairment charges in 2013
and 2014. in october 2015, entergy determined that it will close the pilgrim and fitzpatrick plants. the pilgrim plant will cease operations no later than june 1, 2019. fitzpatrick is expected to shut down at the end of its current fuel cycle, planned for january 27, 2017. during the third quarter 2015, entergy recorded impairment and other related charges to write down the carrying values of the fitzpatrick and pilgrim plants and related assets to their fair values. in addition, in the fourth quarter 2015, entergy recorded impairment and other related charges to write down the carrying value of the palisades plant and related assets to their fair value. in addition to the impairments and other related charges, entergy has incurred severance and employee retention costs and expects to incur additional charges from 2016 into mid-2019 relating to the decisions to shut down vermont yankee, fitzpatrick, and pilgrim. if entergy concludes that any of its nuclear power plants is unlikely to operate through its current useful life, which conclusion would be based on a variety of factors, such a conclusion could result in an impairment of part or all of the carrying value of the plant. any impairment charge taken by entergy with respect to its long-lived assets, including the power plants owned by the entergy wholesale commodities business, would likely be material in the quarter that the charge is taken and could otherwise have a material effect on entergy's results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. for further information regarding evaluating long-lived assets for impairment, see the "

entergy and the utility operating companies depend on access to the capital markets and, at times, may face potential liquidity constraints, which could make it more difficult to handle future contingencies such as natural disasters or substantial increases in gas and fuel prices. disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect entergy's and its subsidiaries' ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and grow their businesses, and the cost of capital.
entergy's business is capital intensive and dependent upon its ability to access capital at reasonable rates and other terms. at times there are also spikes in the price for natural gas and other commodities that increase the liquidity requirements of the utility operating companies and entergy wholesale commodities. in addition, entergy's and the utility operating companies' liquidity needs could significantly increase in the event of a hurricane or other weather-related or unforeseen disaster similar to that experienced in entergy's service territory with hurricane katrina and hurricane rita in 2005, hurricane gustav and hurricane ike in 2008, and hurricane isaac in
2012. the occurrence of one or more contingencies, including a delay in regulatory recovery of fuel or purchased power costs or storm restoration costs, higher than expected pension contributions, an acceleration of payments or decreased credit lines, less cash flow from operations than expected, or other unknown events, such as future storms, could cause the financing needs of entergy and its subsidiaries to increase. in addition, accessing the debt capital markets more frequently in these situations may result in an increase in leverage. material leverage increases could negatively affect the credit ratings of entergy and the utility operating companies, which in turn could negatively affect access to the capital markets.
the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively affect entergy and its subsidiaries' ability to maintain and to expand their businesses. events beyond entergy's control, such as the volatility and disruption in global capital and credit markets in 2008 and
2009, may
289
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy create uncertainty that could increase its cost of capital or impair its ability to access the capital markets, including the ability to draw on its bank credit facilities. entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the degree of success they will have in renewing or replacing their credit facilities as they come up for renewal.
moreover, the size, terms, and covenants of any new credit facilities may not be comparable to, and may be more restrictive than, existing facilities. if entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable, they may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities and/or bear an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could impact their ability to grow their businesses, decrease earnings, significantly reduce financial flexibility and/or limit entergy corporation's ability to sustain its current common stock dividend level.

ability to access capital and/or could require entergy corporation or its subsidiaries to post collateral, accelerate certain payments, or repay certain indebtedness.
there are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for each of entergy corporation and the registrant subsidiaries, including each registrant's regulatory framework, ability to recover costs and earn returns, diversification and financial strength and liquidity. if one or more rating agencies downgrade entergy corporation's, any of the utility operating companies', or system energy's ratings, particularly below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and cash or letter of credit collateral demands may be triggered by the terms of a number of commodity contracts, leases, and other agreements.
most of entergy corporation's and its subsidiaries' large customers, suppliers, and counterparties require sufficient creditworthiness to enter into transactions. if entergy corporation's or its subsidiaries' ratings decline, particularly below investment grade, or if certain counterparties believe entergy corporation or the utility operating companies are losing creditworthiness and demand adequate assurance under fuel, gas, and purchased power contracts, the counterparties may require posting of collateral in cash or letters of credit, prepayment for fuel, gas or purchased power or accelerated payment, or counterparties may decline business with entergy corporation or its subsidiaries. at december 31, 2015, based on power prices at that time, entergy had liquidity exposure of $142 million under the guarantees in place supporting entergy wholesale commodities transactions and $14 million of posted cash collateral. in the event of a decrease in entergy corporation's credit rating to below investment grade, based on power prices as of december 31, 2015, entergy would have been required to provide approximately $52 million of additional cash or letters of credit under some of the agreements. in the event of a decrease in the credit ratings of entergy's utility operating companies to below investment grade, those companies collectively could be required to provide up to $50 million of additional cash or letters of credit to miso. as of december 31, 2015, the liquidity exposure associated with entergy wholesale commodities assurance requirements, including return of previously received collateral from counterparties, would increase by $98 million for a $1 per mmbtu increase in gas prices in both the short- and long-term markets.
entergy and its subsidiaries' ability to successfully complete strategic transactions, including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, restructuring or other strategic transactions, is subject to significant risks, including the risk that required regulatory or governmental approvals may not be obtained, risks relating to unknown or undisclosed problems or liabilities, and the risk that for these or other reasons, entergy and its subsidiaries may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that they anticipate from such transactions.
from time to time, entergy and its subsidiaries have pursued and may continue to pursue strategic transactions including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, restructuring or other strategic transactions. in particular, as discussed in the "capital expenditure plans and other uses of capital - union power station purchase agreement" section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy corporation and subsidiaries, certain of entergy's subsidiaries have entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the union power station, consisting
290
table of contents of four natural gas-fired, combined-cycle gas turbine power blocks, each rated at 495 mw (summer rating), from union power partners, l.p. this transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other material conditions or contingencies. the failure to complete this transaction or any future strategic transaction successfully or on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on entergy's financial condition, results of operations and the market's perception of entergy's ability to execute its strategy. further, this transaction, and any completed or future strategic transactions, involve substantial risks, including the following:
•  acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels;
•  acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate;
•  entergy and/or its subsidiaries may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to them, that exceed their estimates, or for which their rights to indemnification from the seller are limited;
entergy and/or its subsidiaries may be unable to obtain the necessary regulatory or governmental approvals
•  to close a transaction, such approvals may be granted subject to terms that are unacceptable to them, or entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve anticipated regulatory treatment of any such transaction or acquired business or assets; and
•  entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that they anticipate from the transaction, or such benefits may be delayed or may not occur at all.
the construction of, and capital improvements to, power generation facilities involve substantial risks. should construction or capital improvement efforts be unsuccessful, the financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of entergy and the utility operating companies could be materially affected.
entergy's and the utility operating companies' ability to complete construction of power generation facilities in a timely manner and within budget is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. these variables include, but are not limited to, project management expertise and escalating costs for materials, labor, and environmental compliance. delays in obtaining permits, shortages in materials and qualified labor, suppliers and contractors not performing as required under their contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, poor quality initial cost estimates from contractors, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, changes in commodity prices affecting revenue, fuel costs, or materials costs, downward changes in the economy, changes in law or regulation, including environmental compliance requirements, and other events beyond the control of the utility operating companies or the entergy wholesale commodities business may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost, and performance of these projects. if these projects are significantly delayed or become subject to cost overruns or cancellation, entergy and the utility operating companies could incur additional costs and termination payments, or face increased risk of potential write-off of the investment in the project. in addition, the utility operating companies could be exposed to higher costs and market volatility, which could affect cash flow and cost recovery, should their respective regulators decline to approve the construction of new generation needed to meet the reliability needs of customers at the lowest reasonable cost. for further information regarding capital expenditure plans and other uses of capital in connection with the potential construction of additional generation supply sources within the utility operating companies' service territory, and as to the entergy wholesale commodities business, see the " capital expenditure plans and other uses of capital " section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy and each of the registrant subsidiaries.
the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business may incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters.
the businesses in which the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation by local, state, and federal authorities. these laws and regulations affect the manner in which the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business conduct their operations and make capital expenditures. these laws and regulations also affect how the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business manage air emissions, discharges to water, wetlands impacts, solid and hazardous waste storage and disposal, cooling
291
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy and service water intake, the protection of threatened and endangered species, hazardous materials transportation, and similar matters. federal, state, and local authorities continually revise these laws and regulations, and the laws and regulations are subject to judicial interpretation and to the permitting and enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. developing and implementing plans for facility compliance with these requirements can lead to capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures. violations of these requirements can subject the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties' claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards.
in addition, the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business potentially are subject to liability under these laws for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned or operated by the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generate. the utility operating companies are currently involved in proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been released and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to environmental compliance.
emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury, particulates, greenhouse gases, and other regulated air emissions from generating plants are potentially subject to increased regulation, controls and mitigation expenses. in addition, existing air regulations and programs promulgated by the epa often are challenged legally, sometimes resulting in large-scale changes to anticipated regulatory regimes and the resulting need to shift course, both operationally and economically, depending on the nature of the changes. risks relating to global climate change, initiatives to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions, and water availability issues are discussed below.
entergy and its subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals.
if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or if entergy and its subsidiaries fail to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, the operation of its facilities could be stopped or become subject to additional costs. for further information regarding environmental regulation and environmental matters, see the "

the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business may incur substantial costs related to reliability standards.
entergy's business is subject to extensive and mandatory reliability standards. such standards, which are established by the north american electric reliability corporation (nerc), the serc reliability corporation (serc), and other regional enforcement entities, are approved by the ferc and frequently are reviewed, amended, and supplemented. failure to comply with such standards could result in the imposition of fines or civil penalties, and potential exposure to third party claims for alleged violations of such standards. the standards, as well as the laws and regulations that govern them, are subject to judicial interpretation and to the enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. in addition to exposure to civil penalties and fines, the utility operating companies have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to compliance with new and existing reliability standards, including costs associated with the utility operating companies' transmission system and generation assets. the changes to the reliability standards applicable to the electric power industry are ongoing, and entergy cannot predict the ultimate effect that the reliability standards will have on its utility and entergy wholesale commodities.

the effects of weather and economic conditions, and the related impact on electricity and gas usage, may materially affect the utility operating companies
'
results of operations.
292
table of contents temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase summer cooling electricity demand and revenues, and temperatures below moderate levels in the winter tend to increase winter heating electricity and gas demand and revenues. as a corollary, moderate temperatures tend to decrease usage of energy and resulting revenues. seasonal pricing differentials, coupled with higher consumption levels, typically cause the utility operating companies to report higher revenues in the third quarter of the fiscal year than in the other quarters. extreme weather conditions or storms, however, may stress the utility operating companies' generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on their ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. these extreme conditions could have a material effect on the utility operating companies' financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.
entergy's electricity sales volumes are affected by a number of factors, including the state of the national and regional economies, weather, customer bill sizes (large bills tend to induce conservation), trends in energy efficiency, and the willingness and ability of large industrial customers to develop co-generation facilities that greatly reduce their demand from entergy. some of these factors are inherently cyclical or temporary in nature, such as the weather or economic conditions, and rarely have a long-lasting impact on entergy's operating results.
others, such as the increasing adoption of energy efficient appliances and building codes, are having a more permanent impact of reducing sales growth rates from historical norms. newer technologies such as distributed generation have not yet had a substantive impact on entergy's electricity sales, but further advances have the potential to do so in the future. entergy's industrial sales, in particular, benefit from steady economic growth and favorable commodity prices and are also sensitive to changes in conditions in the markets in which its customers operate. any negative change in any of these factors has the potential to result in slower sales growth or sales declines and increased bad debt expense, which could materially affect entergy's and the utility operating companies' results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
the effects of climate change and environmental and regulatory obligations intended to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions or to place a price on greenhouse gas emissions could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of entergy, the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business.
in an effort to address climate change concerns, federal, state, and local authorities are calling for additional laws and regulations aimed at known or suspected causes of climate change. for example, in response to the united states supreme court's 2007 decision holding that the epa has authority to regulate emissions of co2 and other
"greenhouse gases" under the clean air act, the epa, various environmental interest groups, and other organizations are focusing considerable attention on co2 emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. in 2010, epa promulgated its first regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions from certain vehicles and from new and significantly modified stationary sources of emissions, including electric generating units. during 2012 and 2014, epa proposed co2 emission standards for new and existing sources; epa finalized these standards in 2015. as examples of state action, in the northeast, the regional greenhouse gas initiative (rggi)
establishes a cap on co2 emissions from electric power plants and requires generators to purchase emission permits to cover their co2 emissions, and a similar program has been developed in california.
developing and implementing plans for compliance with greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirements can lead to additional capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures and could significantly affect the economic position of existing facilities and proposed projects; moreover, long-term planning to meet environmental requirements can be negatively impacted and costs may increase to the extent laws and regulations change prior to full implementation. these requirements could, in turn, lead to changes in the planning or operations of balancing authorities or organized markets in areas where the utility operating companies, system energy, or entergy wholesale commodities do business. violations of such requirements may subject entergy wholesale commodities and the utility operating companies to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties' claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. to the extent entergy believes any of these costs are recoverable in rates, however, additional material rate increases for customers could be
293
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy resisted by entergy's regulators and, in extreme cases, entergy's regulators might deny or defer timely recovery of these costs. future changes in environmental regulation governing the emission of co2 and other greenhouse gases could make some of entergy's electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, and could increase the difficulty that entergy and its subsidiaries have with obtaining or maintaining required environmental regulatory approvals, which could also materially affect the financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of entergy and its subsidiaries. in addition, lawsuits have occurred or are reasonably expected against emitters of greenhouse gases alleging that these companies are liable for personal injuries and property damage caused by climate change. these lawsuits may seek injunctive relief, monetary compensation, and punitive damages.
in addition to the regulatory and financial risks associated with climate change discussed above, potential physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level, wind and storm surge damages, wetland and barrier island erosion, risks of flooding and changes in weather conditions, (such as increases in precipitation, drought, or changes in average temperatures), and potential increased impacts of extreme weather conditions or storms. entergy subsidiaries own assets in, and serve, communities that are at risk from sea level rise, changes in weather conditions, storms, and loss of the protection offered by coastal wetlands. a significant portion of the nation's oil and gas infrastructure is located in these areas and susceptible to storm damage that could be aggravated by wetland and barrier island erosion, which could give rise to fuel supply interruptions and price spikes. entergy and its subsidiaries also face the risk that climate change could impact the availability and quality of water supply necessary for operations.
these and other physical changes could result in changes in customer demand, increased costs associated with repairing and maintaining generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on the entergy system's ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. also, to the extent that climate change adversely impacts the economic health of a region or results in energy conservation or demand side management programs, it may adversely impact customer demand and revenues. such physical or operational risks could have a material effect on entergy's, entergy wholesale commodities', system energy's, and the utility operating companies' financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.
continued and future availability and quality of water for cooling, process, and sanitary uses could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business.
water is a vital natural resource that is also critical to the utility operating companies'
, system energy's, and entergy wholesale commodities' business operations. entergy's facilities use water for cooling, boiler make-up, sanitary uses, potable supply, and many other uses. two of entergy's utility operating companies own and/or operate hydroelectric facilities. accordingly, water availability and quality are critical to entergy's business operations. impacts to water availability or quality could negatively impact both operations and revenues.
entergy secures water through various mechanisms (ground water wells, surface waters intakes, municipal supply, etc.) and operates under the provisions and conditions set forth by the provider and/or regulatory authorities.
entergy also obtains and operates in substantial compliance with water discharge permits issued under various provisions of the clean water act and/or state water pollution control provisions. regulations and authorizations for both water intake and use and for waste discharge can become more stringent in times of water shortages, low flows in rivers, low lake levels, low groundwater aquifer volumes, and similar conditions. the increased use of water by industry, agriculture, and the population at large, population growth, and the potential impacts of climate change on water resources may cause water use restrictions that affect entergy and its subsidiaries.
entergy and its subsidiaries may not be adequately hedged against changes in commodity prices, which could materially affect entergy's and its subsidiaries' results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
to manage near-term financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, entergy and its subsidiaries, including the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business, may enter into contracts
294
table of contents to hedge portions of their purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements, and inventories of natural gas, uranium and its conversion and enrichment, coal, refined products, and other commodities, within established risk management guidelines. as part of this strategy, entergy and its subsidiaries may utilize fixed- and variable-price forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-
the-counter markets or on exchanges. however, entergy and its subsidiaries normally cover only a portion of the exposure of their assets and positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. in addition, entergy also elects to leave certain volumes during certain years unhedged. to the extent entergy and its subsidiaries have unhedged positions, fluctuating commodity prices can materially affect entergy's and its subsidiaries' results of operations and financial position.
although entergy and its subsidiaries devote a considerable effort to these risk management strategies, they cannot eliminate all the risks associated with these activities. as a result of these and other factors, entergy and its subsidiaries cannot predict with precision the impact that risk management decisions may have on their business, results of operations, or financial position.
entergy has guaranteed or indemnified the performance of a portion of the obligations relating to hedging and risk management activities. reductions in entergy's or its subsidiaries' credit quality or changes in the market prices of energy commodities could increase the cash or letter of credit collateral required to be posted in connection with hedging and risk management activities, which could materially affect entergy's or its subsidiaries' liquidity and financial position.
the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their obligations, which may materially affect the utility operating companies and entergy wholesale commodities.
the hedging and risk management practices of the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe entergy and its subsidiaries money, energy, or other commodities will not perform their obligations. currently, some hedging agreements contain provisions that require the counterparties to provide credit support to secure all or part of their obligations to entergy or its subsidiaries. if the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, entergy or its subsidiaries may enforce and recover the proceeds from the credit support provided and acquire alternative hedging arrangements, which credit support may not always be adequate to cover the related obligations. in such event, entergy and its subsidiaries might incur losses in addition to amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. in addition, the credit commitments of entergy's lenders under its bank facilities may not be honored for a variety of reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting such lenders, which could materially affect the adequacy of its liquidity sources.
the wall street transparency and accountability act of 2010 and rules and regulations promulgated under the act may adversely affect the ability of the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business to utilize certain commodity derivatives for hedging and mitigating commercial risk.
the wall street transparency and accountability act of 2010, which was enacted on july 21, 2010 as part of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (act), and the rules and regulations promulgated under the act impose governmental regulation on the over-the-counter derivative market, including the commodity swaps used by the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business to hedge and mitigate commercial risk. under the act, certain swaps are subject to mandatory clearing and exchange trading requirements.
swap dealers and major market participants in the swap market are subject to capital, margin, registration, reporting, recordkeeping, and business conduct requirements with respect to their swap activities. entergy is not a swap dealer or a major swap participant, and does not expect to qualify as either in the future. non-swap dealers and non-major swap participants, such as entergy, are subject to reporting, recordkeeping, and business conduct requirements (i.e., anti-manipulation, anti-disruptive trading practices, and whistleblower provisions) with respect to their swap activities. position limits may also apply to certain swaps activities. position limit rules promulgated by the commodity futures trading commission were vacated by the us district court for the district of columbia. the
295
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy commodity futures trading commission has subsequently proposed new position limit rules. if the commodity futures trading commission's issues final position limit rules, those rules may apply to certain of entergy's swaps activities.
the act required the applicable regulators, which in the case of commodity swaps will be the commodity futures trading commission, to engage in substantial rulemaking in order to implement the provisions of the act and such rulemaking has been largely completed. both the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business currently utilize commodity swaps to hedge and mitigate commodity price risk. it is not known whether the act and regulations promulgated under the act will have an adverse effect upon the market for the commodity swaps used by the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business. however, to the extent that the act and regulations promulgated under the act have the effect of increasing the price of such commodity swaps or limiting or reducing the availability of such commodity swaps, whether through the imposition of additional capital, margin, or compliance costs upon market participants, the imposition of position limits, or otherwise, the financial performance of the utility operating companies and/or the entergy wholesale commodities business may be adversely affected. to the extent that the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business may be required to post margin in connection with existing or future commodity swaps in addition to any margin currently posted by such entities, such entities may need to secure additional sources of capital to meet such liquidity needs or cease utilizing such commodity swaps.
market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require additional funding and result in increased benefit plan costs.
the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust under entergy's pension and postretirement benefit plans. a decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements relating to entergy's benefit plan liabilities and also result in higher benefit costs. as the value of the assets decreases, the "expected return on assets" component of benefit costs decreases, resulting in higher benefits costs. additionally, asset losses are incorporated into benefit costs over time, thus increasing benefits costs.
volatility in the capital markets has affected the market value of these assets, which may affect entergy's planned levels of contributions in the future. additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under entergy's pension and postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding and recognition of higher liability carrying costs. the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans can also increase as a result of changes in, among other factors, retirement rates, life expectancy assumptions, or federal regulations. for further information regarding entergy's pension and other postretirement benefit plans, refer to the "
critical accounting estimates
- qualified pension and other postretirement benefits " section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy and each of its registrant subsidiaries and note 11 to the financial statements.
the litigation environment in the states in which certain entergy subsidiaries operate poses a significant risk to those businesses.
entergy and its subsidiaries are involved in the ordinary course of business in a number of lawsuits involving employment, commercial, asbestos, hazardous material and ratepayer matters, and injuries and damages issues, among other matters. the states in which the utility operating companies operate, in particular louisiana, mississippi, and texas, have proven to be unusually litigious environments. judges and juries in these states have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and business tort cases. entergy and its subsidiaries use legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against them, but the litigation environment in these states poses a significant business risk.
domestic or international terrorist attacks, including cyber attacks, and failures or breaches of entergy's and its subsidiaries' technology systems may adversely affect entergy's results of operations.
296
table of contents as power generators and distributors, entergy and its subsidiaries face heightened risk of an act or threat of terrorism, including physical and cyber attacks, either as a direct act against one of entergy's generation facilities, transmission operations centers, or distribution infrastructure used to manage and transport power to customers. an actual act could affect entergy's ability to operate, including its ability to operate the information technology systems and network infrastructure on which it relies to conduct its business. the utility operating companies also face heightened risk of an act or threat by cyber criminals, intent on accessing personal information for the purpose of committing identity theft.
entergy and its subsidiaries operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure in accordance with prescriptive standards.
despite the implementation of multiple layers of security by entergy and its subsidiaries, technology systems remain vulnerable to potential threats that could lead to unauthorized access or loss of availability to critical systems essential to the reliable operation of entergy's electric system. if entergy's or its subsidiaries'
technology systems were compromised and unable to recover timely to a normal state of operations, entergy or its subsidiaries may be unable to perform critical business functions that are essential to the company's well-being and the health, safety, and security needs of its customers. in addition, an attack on its information technology infrastructure may result in a loss of its confidential, sensitive, and proprietary information, including personal information of its customers, employees, vendors, and others in entergy's care.
if any such attacks, failures or breaches were to occur, entergy's and the utility operating companies' business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. the risk of such attacks, failures, or breaches may cause entergy and the utility operating companies to incur increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for its nuclear power plants and other facilities, such as additional physical facility security and additional security personnel, and for systems to protect its information technology and network infrastructure systems. such events may also expose entergy to an increased risk of judgments and fines.
changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact entergy's, the utility operating companies', and system energy's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
entergy and its subsidiaries make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various transactions and results of operations to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. these tax obligations include income, franchise, real estate, sales and use, and employment-related taxes. these judgments include provisions for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. entergy and its subsidiaries also estimate their ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. changes in federal, state, or local tax laws, adverse tax audit results or adverse tax rulings on positions taken by entergy and its subsidiaries could negatively affect entergy's, the utility operating companies', and system energy's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. for further information regarding entergy's income taxes, refer to note 3 to the financial statements.
(entergy new orleans)
the effect of higher purchased gas cost charges to customers may adversely affect entergy new orleans's results of operations and liquidity.
gas rates charged to retail gas customers are comprised primarily of purchased gas cost charges, which provide no return or profit to entergy new orleans, and distribution charges, which provide a return or profit to the utility.
distribution charges are affected by the amount of gas sold to customers. purchased gas cost charges, which comprise most of a customer's bill and may be adjusted monthly, represent gas commodity costs that entergy new orleans recovers from its customers. entergy new orleans's cash flows can be affected by differences between the time period when gas is purchased and the time when ultimate recovery from customers occurs. when purchased gas cost charges increase substantially reflecting higher gas procurement costs incurred by entergy new orleans, customer
297
table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy usage may decrease, especially in weaker economic times, resulting in lower distribution charges for entergy new orleans, which could adversely affect results of operations.
(system energy)
system energy owns and operates a single nuclear generating facility, and it is dependent on affiliated companies for all of its revenues.
system energy's operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% ownership/leasehold interest in grand gulf. charges under the unit power sales agreement are paid by the utility operating companies as consideration for their respective entitlements to receive capacity and energy. the useful economic life of grand gulf is finite and is limited by the terms of its operating license, which is currently due to expire on november 1, 2024. system energy filed in october 2011 an application with the nrc for an extension of grand gulf's operating license to 2044. system energy's financial condition depends both on the receipt of payments from the utility operating companies under the unit power sales agreement and on the continued commercial operation of grand gulf.
for information regarding the unit power sales agreement, the sale and leaseback transactions and certain other agreements relating to the entergy system companies' support of system energy (including the capital funds agreement), see the "
grand gulf-related agreements

(entergy corporation)
as a holding company, entergy corporation depends on cash distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock.
entergy corporation is a holding company with no material revenue generating operations of its own or material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. accordingly, all of its operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. entergy corporation's ability to satisfy its financial obligations, including the payment of interest and principal on its outstanding debt, and to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the payment to it of dividends or distributions by its subsidiaries. the payments of dividends or distributions to entergy corporation by its subsidiaries in turn depend on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained earnings, and on any applicable legal, regulatory, or contractual limitations on subsidiaries' ability to pay such dividends or distributions. provisions in the organizational documents, indentures for debt issuances, and other agreements of certain of entergy corporation's subsidiaries restrict the payment of cash dividends to entergy corporation. for further information regarding dividend or distribution restrictions to entergy corporation, see the "
retained earnings and dividend restrictions

table of contents entergy arkansas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis results of operations net income
2015 compared to 2014
net income decreased $47.1 million primarily due to higher other operation and maintenance expenses, partially offset by higher net revenue.
2014 compared to 2013
net income decreased $40.6 million primarily due to higher other operation and maintenance expenses, lower other income, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, and a higher effective income tax rate, partially offset by higher net revenue.
net revenue
2015 compared to 2014
net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2)
purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory credits. following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2015 to 2014.

2015 net revenue                   $1,362.2
the volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 110 gwh, or 1%, in billed electricity usage, including the effect of more favorable weather on residential and commercial sales and an increase in industrial usage. the increase in industrial usage is primarily due to increased demand by existing customers primarily in the petroleum refining and primary metals industries.
the retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in the energy efficiency rider, as approved by the apsc, effective july 2014 and july 2015. energy efficiency revenues are largely offset by costs included in other operation and maintenance expenses and have minimal effect on net income.
the asset retirement obligation affects net revenue because entergy arkansas records a regulatory charge or credit for the difference between asset retirement obligation-related expenses and trust earnings plus asset retirement obligation related costs collected in revenue. the variance is primarily caused by an increase in regulatory credits because of an increase in accretion expense.

2014 net revenue                   $1,335.9
the retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in the energy efficiency rider, as approved by the apsc, effective july 2013 and july 2014, and the effect of the apsc's order in the 2013 rate case, including an annual base rate increase effective january 2014, offset by a miso rider to provide customers credits in rates for transmission revenue received through miso. energy efficiency revenues are largely offset by costs included in other operation and maintenance expenses and have minimal effect on net income. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case.
the reserve equalization variance is primarily due to the absence of reserve equalization expenses as compared to
2013 resulting from entergy arkansas's exit from the system agreement.
the transmission revenue variance is primarily due to changes as a result of participation in the miso rto in 2014.
the asset retirement obligation affects net revenue because entergy arkansas records a regulatory debit or credit for the difference between asset retirement obligation-related expenses and trust earnings plus asset retirement obligation related costs collected in revenue. the variance is primarily caused by an increase in regulatory credits because of a decrease in decommissioning trust earnings.
the miso deferral variance is due to the deferral in april 2013, as approved by the apsc, of costs incurred from march 2010 through december 2012 related to the transition and implementation of joining the miso rto.
the volume/weather variance is primarily due to a decrease in sales volume during the unbilled sales period, partially offset by an increase of 190 gwh, or 1%, in billed electricity usage primarily in the residential sector.
the net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to lower margins on co-owner contracts due to contract changes.

table of contents entergy arkansas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis extended beyond the originally-planned duration of the refueling outage. in february 2014 the apsc approved entergy arkansas's request to exclude from the calculation of its revised energy cost rate $65.9 million of deferred fuel and purchased energy costs incurred in 2013 as a result of the ano stator incident. the apsc authorized entergy arkansas to retain the $65.9 million in its deferred fuel balance with recovery to be reviewed in a later period after more information regarding various claims associated with the ano stator incident is available.
entergy arkansas is pursuing its options for recovering damages that resulted from the stator drop, including its insurance coverage and legal action. entergy is a member of nuclear electric insurance limited (neil), a mutual insurance company that provides property damage coverage to the members' nuclear generating plants, including ano.
neil has notified entergy that it believes that a $50 million course of construction sublimit applies to any loss associated with the lifting apparatus failure and stator drop at ano. entergy has responded that it disagrees with neil's position and is evaluating its options for enforcing its rights under the policy. during 2014, entergy arkansas collected $50 million from neil and is pursuing additional recoveries due under the policy. in july 2013, entergy arkansas filed a complaint in the circuit court in pope county, arkansas against the owner of the heavy-
lifting apparatus that collapsed, an engineering firm, a contractor, and certain individuals asserting claims of breach of contract, negligence, and gross negligence in connection with their responsibility for the stator drop.
shortly after the stator incident, the nrc deployed an augmented inspection team to review the plant's response. in july 2013 a second team of nrc inspectors visited ano to evaluate certain items that were identified as requiring follow-up inspection to determine whether performance deficiencies existed. in march 2014 the nrc issued an inspection report on the follow-up inspection that discussed two preliminary findings, one that was preliminarily determined to be "red with high safety significance" for unit 1 and one that was preliminarily determined to be
"yellow with substantial safety significance" for unit 2, with the nrc indicating further that these preliminary findings may warrant additional regulatory oversight. this report also noted that one additional item related to flood barrier effectiveness was still under review.
in may 2014 the nrc met with entergy during a regulatory conference to discuss the preliminary red and yellow findings and entergy's response to the findings. during the regulatory conference, entergy presented information on the facts and assumptions the nrc used to assess the potential findings. the nrc used the information provided by entergy at the regulatory conference to finalize its decision regarding the inspection team's findings. in a letter dated june 23, 2014, the nrc classified both findings as "yellow with substantial safety significance." in an assessment follow-up letter for ano dated july 29, 2014, the nrc stated that given the two yellow findings, it determined that the performance at ano is in the "degraded cornerstone column," or column 3, of the nrc's reactor oversight process action matrix beginning the first quarter 2014. corrective actions in response to the nrc's findings have been taken and remain ongoing at ano.
in september 2014 the nrc issued an inspection report on the flood barrier effectiveness issue that was still under review at the time of the march 2014 inspection report. while entergy believes that the flood barrier issues that led to the finding have been addressed at ano, nrc processes still required that the nrc assess the safety significance of the deficiencies. in its september 2014 inspection report, the nrc discussed a preliminary finding of "yellow with substantial safety significance" for the unit 1 and unit 2 auxiliary and emergency diesel fuel storage buildings. the nrc indicated that these preliminary findings may warrant additional regulatory oversight.
entergy requested a public regulatory conference regarding the inspection, and the conference was held in october
2014. during the regulatory conference, entergy presented information related to the facts and assumptions used by the nrc in arriving at its preliminary finding of "yellow with substantial safety significance." in january 2015
the nrc issued its final risk significance determination for the flood barrier violation originally cited in the september 2014 report. the nrc's final risk significance determination was classified as "yellow with substantial safety significance."
in march 2015 the nrc issued a letter notifying entergy of its decision to move ano into the "multiple/repetitive degraded cornerstone column" (column 4) of the nrc's reactor oversight process action matrix. placement into column
4 requires significant additional nrc inspection activities at the ano site, including a review of the site's root cause evaluation associated with the flood barrier and stator issues, an assessment of the effectiveness of the site's

union power station purchase agreement in december 2014, entergy arkansas, entergy gulf states louisiana, and entergy texas entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the union power station, a 1,980 mw (summer rating) power generation facility located near el dorado, arkansas, from union power partners, l.p. the union power station consists of four natural gas-fired, combined-cycle gas turbine power blocks, each rated at 495 mw (summer rating). pursuant to the agreement, entergy gulf states louisiana would acquire two of the power blocks and a 50% undivided ownership interest in certain assets related to the facility, and entergy arkansas and entergy texas would each acquire one power block and a 25%
undivided ownership interest in such related assets. the base purchase price is expected to be approximately $948
million (approximately $237 million for each power block) subject to adjustments. the purchase is contingent upon, among other things, obtaining necessary approvals, including cost recovery, from various federal and state regulatory and permitting agencies. under the original terms of the asset purchase agreement, these included regulatory approvals from the apsc, lpsc, puct, and ferc, as well as clearance under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust law.
in december 2014, entergy texas filed its application for certificate of convenience and necessity (ccn) with the puct seeking one of the two necessary puct approvals of the acquisition. based on the opposition to the acquisition of the power block, entergy texas determined it was appropriate to seek to dismiss the ccn filing. in july 2015, entergy texas withdrew its rate case and, together with other parties, filed a motion with the puct to dismiss entergy texas's ccn application. in july 2015, the puct granted the motion to dismiss the ccn case. the power block originally allocated to entergy texas will be acquired by entergy new orleans. the acquisition by entergy new orleans replaces the power purchase agreement with entergy gulf states louisiana that the city council approved in june 2015. in august 2015, entergy new orleans filed an application with the city council seeking authorization to proceed with the acquisition of the power block and seeking approval of the recovery of the associated costs. in november 2015 the city council issued written resolutions and an order approving an agreement in principle between entergy new orleans and city council advisors providing that the purchase of power block 1 and related assets by entergy new orleans is prudent and in the public interest.
in january 2015, entergy gulf states louisiana filed its application with the lpsc for approval of the acquisition and cost recovery. supplemental testimony was submitted in july 2015 explaining the reallocation of one of the power blocks to entergy new orleans and clarifying that entergy gulf states louisiana would own 100% of the capacity and associated energy of two power blocks. in september 2015, entergy gulf states louisiana agreed to settlement terms with all parties for entergy gulf states louisiana's purchase of the two power blocks. in october
2015 the lpsc voted unanimously to approve the uncontested settlement which finds, among other things, that acquisition of power blocks 3 and 4 is in the public interest and, therefore, prudent. the business combination of entergy gulf states

state and local rate regulation and fuel-cost recovery retail rates
2013 base rate filing in march 2013, entergy arkansas filed with the apsc for a general change in rates, charges, and tariffs. the filing assumed entergy arkansas's transition to miso in december 2013, and requested a rate increase of $174 million , including $49 million of revenue being transferred from collection in riders to base rates. the filing also proposed a new transmission rider and a capacity cost recovery rider. the filing requested a 10.4% return on common equity. in september 2013, entergy arkansas filed testimony reflecting an updated rate increase request of $145
million , with no change to its requested return on common equity of 10.4% . hearings in the proceeding began in october 2013, and in december 2013 the apsc issued an order. the order authorized a base rate increase of $81
million and included an authorized return on common equity of 9.3% . the order allowed entergy arkansas to amortize its human capital management costs over a three-and-a-half year period, but also ordered entergy arkansas to file a detailed report of the arkansas-specific costs, savings, and final payroll changes upon conclusion of the human capital management

order, revised rates were effective for all bills rendered after december 31, 2013 and were implemented in the first billing cycle of october 2014.
2015 base rate filing in april 2015, entergy arkansas filed with the apsc for a general change in rates, charges, and tariffs. the filing notified the apsc of entergy arkansas's intent to implement a forward test year formula rate plan pursuant to arkansas legislation passed in 2015, and requested a retail rate increase of $268.4 million, with a net increase in revenue of $167 million. the filing requested a 10.2% return on common equity. in may 2015 the apsc issued an order suspending the proposed rates and tariffs filed by entergy arkansas and establishing a procedural schedule to complete its investigation of entergy arkansas's application. in september 2015, apsc staff and intervenors filed direct testimony, with the apsc staff recommending a revenue requirement of $217.9 million and a 9.65% return on common equity. entergy arkansas filed rebuttal testimony in october 2015. in december 2015, entergy arkansas, the apsc staff, and certain of the intervenors in the rate case filed with the apsc a joint motion for approval of a settlement of the case that proposes a retail rate increase of approximately $225 million with a net increase in revenue of approximately $133 million; an authorized return on common equity of 9.75%; and a formula rate plan tariff that provides a 50 basis point band around the 9.75% allowed return on common equity.
a hearing was held in january 2016. in february 2016 the apsc approved the settlement with one exception that would reduce the retail rate increase proposed in the settlement by $5 million. the parties were directed to inform the apsc by filing no later than february 26, 2016 whether they accept the apsc's proposed settlement agreement modification or request a full hearing on the issues. entergy arkansas plans to make its first formula rate plan filing in july 2016 for rates effective with the first billing cycle of january 2017.
a significant portion of the rate increase is related to entergy arkansas's acquisition of union power station power block 2 for an expected base purchase price of $237 million, subject to adjustment. the acquisition is expected to be completed promptly following the receipt of ferc approval. if the acquisition closes on or before march 24, 2016, recovery of the costs to acquire power block 2 of the union power station will be through entergy arkansas's new base rates that will commence with the first billing cycle of april 2016. if the transaction closes after that date, the parties have agreed to concurrent cost recovery through entergy arkansas's capacity acquisition rider.
production cost allocation rider the apsc approved a production cost allocation rider for recovery from customers of the retail portion of the costs allocated to entergy arkansas as a result of the system agreement proceedings. these costs cause an increase in entergy arkansas's deferred fuel cost balance because entergy arkansas pays the costs over seven months but collects them from customers over twelve months. see note 2 to the financial statements and entergy corporation and subsidiaries "
management's financial discussion and analysis -
system agreement " for discussions of the system agreement proceedings.
in may 2014, entergy arkansas filed its annual redetermination of the production cost allocation rider to recover the $3 million unrecovered retail balance as of december 31, 2013 and the $67.8 million system agreement bandwidth remedy payment made in may 2014 as a result of the compliance filing pursuant to the ferc's february 2014 orders related to the bandwidth payments/receipts for the june - december 2005 period. in june 2014 the apsc suspended the annual redetermination of the production cost allocation rider and scheduled a hearing in september

2014. upon a joint motion of the parties, the apsc canceled the september 2014 hearing and in january 2015 the apsc issued an order approving entergy arkansas's request for recovery of the $3 million under-recovered amount based on the true-up of the production cost allocation rider and the $67.8 million may 2014 system agreement bandwidth remedy payment subject to refund with interest, with recovery of these payments concluding with the last billing cycle in december 2015. the apsc also found that entergy arkansas is entitled to carrying charges pursuant to the current terms of the production cost allocation rider. entergy arkansas made its compliance filing pursuant to the order in january 2015 and the apsc issued its approval order, also in january 2015. the redetermined rate went into effect the first billing cycle of february 2015.
in may 2015, entergy arkansas filed its annual redetermination of the production cost allocation rider, which included a $38 million payment made by entergy arkansas as a result of the ferc's february 2014 order related to the comprehensive bandwidth recalculation for calendar year 2006, 2007, and 2008 production costs. the redetermined rate for the 2015 production cost allocation rider update was added to the redetermined rate from the 2014
production cost allocation rider update and the combined rate was effective with the first billing cycle of july
2015. this combined rate was effective through december 2015. the collection of the remainder of the redetermined rate for the 2015 production cost allocation rider update will continue through june 2016.
energy cost recovery rider entergy arkansas's retail rates include an energy cost recovery rider to recover fuel and purchased energy costs in monthly customer bills. the rider utilizes the prior calendar-year energy costs and projected energy sales for the twelve-month period commencing on april 1 of each year to develop an energy cost rate, which is redetermined annually and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over- or under-recovery, including carrying charges, of the energy costs for the prior calendar year. the energy cost recovery rider tariff also allows an interim rate request depending upon the level of over- or under-recovery of fuel and purchased energy costs.
in october 2005 the apsc initiated an investigation into entergy arkansas's interim energy cost recovery rate. the investigation focused on entergy arkansas's 1) gas contracting, portfolio, and hedging practices; 2) wholesale purchases during the period; 3) management of the coal inventory at its coal generation plants; and 4) response to the contractual failure of the railroads to provide coal deliveries. in march 2006 the apsc extended its investigation to cover the costs included in entergy arkansas's march 2006 annual energy cost rate filing, and a hearing was held in the apsc investigation in october 2006.
in january 2007 the apsc issued an order in its review of the energy cost rate. the apsc found that entergy arkansas failed to maintain an adequate coal inventory level going into the summer of 2005 and that entergy arkansas should be responsible for any incremental energy costs that resulted from two outages caused by employee and contractor error. the coal plant generation curtailments were caused by railroad delivery problems and entergy arkansas resolved litigation with the railroad regarding the delivery problems. the apsc staff was directed to perform an analysis with entergy arkansas's assistance to determine the additional fuel and purchased energy costs associated with these findings and file the analysis within sixty days of the order. after a final determination of the costs is made by the apsc, entergy arkansas will be directed to refund that amount with interest to its customers as a credit on the energy cost recovery rider. entergy arkansas requested rehearing of the order.
in february 2010 the apsc denied entergy arkansas's request for rehearing, and held a hearing in september 2010 to determine the amount of damages, if any, that should be assessed against entergy arkansas. a decision is pending.
entergy arkansas expects the amount of damages, if any, to have an immaterial effect on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
the apsc also established a separate docket to consider the resolved railroad litigation, and in february 2010 it established a procedural schedule that concluded with testimony through september 2010. the testimony was filed, and the apsc will decide the case based on the record in the proceeding.

table of contents entergy arkansas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis in january 2014, entergy arkansas filed a motion with the apsc relating to its redetermination of its energy cost rate that was filed in march 2014. in that motion, entergy arkansas requested that the apsc authorize entergy arkansas to exclude $65.9 million of deferred fuel and purchased energy costs incurred in 2013 from the redetermination of its 2014 energy cost rate. the $65.9 million is an estimate of the incremental fuel and replacement energy costs that entergy arkansas incurred as a result of the ano stator incident. entergy arkansas requested that the apsc authorize entergy arkansas to retain that amount in its deferred fuel balance, with recovery to be reviewed in a later period after more information is available regarding various claims associated with the ano stator incident. the apsc approved entergy arkansas's request in february 2014. see the "
ano damage, outage, and nrc reviews
" section above for further discussion of the ano stator incident.
storm cost recovery entergy arkansas december 2012 winter storm in december 2012 a severe winter storm consisting of ice, snow, and high winds caused significant damage to entergy arkansas's distribution lines, equipment, poles, and other facilities. total restoration costs for the repair and/or replacement of entergy arkansas's electrical facilities in areas damaged from the winter storm were $63
million, including costs recorded as regulatory assets of approximately $22 million. in the entergy arkansas 2013
rate case, the apsc approved inclusion of the construction spending in rate base and approved an increase in the normal storm cost accrual.
opportunity sales proceeding in june 2009, the lpsc filed a complaint requesting that the ferc determine that certain of entergy arkansas's sales of electric energy to third parties: (a) violated the provisions of the system agreement that allocate the energy generated by entergy system resources, (b) imprudently denied the entergy system and its ultimate consumers the benefits of low-cost entergy system generating capacity, and (c) violated the provision of the system agreement that prohibits sales to third parties by individual companies absent an offer of a right-of-first-refusal to other utility operating companies. the lpsc's complaint challenges sales made beginning in 2002 and requests refunds. in july 2009, the utility operating companies filed a response to the complaint requesting that the ferc dismiss the complaint on the merits without hearing because the lpsc has failed to meet its burden of showing any violation of the system agreement and failed to produce any evidence of imprudent action by the entergy system. in their response, the utility operating companies explained that the system agreement clearly contemplates that the utility operating companies may make sales to third parties for their own account, subject to the requirement that those sales be included in the load (or load shape) for the applicable utility operating company. the response further explained that the ferc already had determined that entergy arkansas's short-term wholesale sales did not trigger the "right-of-first-refusal" provision of the system agreement. while the d.c. circuit recently determined that the
"right-of-first-refusal" issue was not properly before the ferc at the time of its earlier decision on the issue, the lpsc raised no additional claims or facts that would warrant the ferc reaching a different conclusion.
the lpsc filed direct testimony in the proceeding alleging, among other things, (1) that entergy violated the system agreement by permitting entergy arkansas to make non-requirements sales to non-affiliated third parties rather than making such energy available to the other utility operating companies' customers; and (2) that over the period 2000 - 2009, these non-requirements sales caused harm to the utility operating companies' customers and these customers should be compensated for this harm by entergy. in subsequent testimony, the lpsc modified its original damages claim in favor of quantifying damages by re-running intra-system bills. the utility operating companies believe the lpsc's allegations are without merit. a hearing in the matter was held in august 2010.
in december 2010, the alj issued an initial decision. the alj found that the system agreement allowed for entergy arkansas to make the sales to third parties but concluded that the sales should be accounted for in the same manner as joint account sales. the alj concluded that "shareholders" should make refunds of the damages to the
315
table of contents entergy arkansas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis utility operating companies, along with interest. entergy disagreed with several aspects of the alj's initial decision and in january 2011 filed with the ferc exceptions to the decision.
the ferc issued a decision in june 2012 and held that, while the system agreement is ambiguous, it does provide authority for individual utility operating companies to make opportunity sales for their own account and entergy arkansas made and priced these sales in good faith. the ferc found, however, that the system agreement does not provide authority for an individual utility operating company to allocate the energy associated with such opportunity sales as part of its load, but provides a different allocation authority. the ferc further found that the after-the-fact accounting methodology used to allocate the energy used to supply the sales was inconsistent with the system agreement. quantifying the effect of the ferc's decision will require re-running intra-system bills for a ten-year period, and the ferc in its decision established further hearing procedures to determine the calculation of the effects. in july 2012, entergy and the lpsc filed requests for rehearing of the ferc's june 2012
decision, which are pending with the ferc.
as required by the procedural schedule established in the calculation proceeding, entergy filed its direct testimony that included a proposed illustrative re-run, consistent with the directives in ferc's order, of intra-
system bills for 2003, 2004, and 2006, the three years with the highest volume of opportunity sales. entergy's proposed illustrative re-run of intra-system bills shows that the potential cost for entergy arkansas would be up to $12 million for the years 2003, 2004, and 2006, excluding interest, and the potential benefit would be significantly less than that for each of the other utility operating companies. entergy's proposed illustrative re-
run of the intra-system bills also shows an offsetting potential benefit to entergy arkansas for the years 2003,
2004, and 2006 resulting from the effects of the ferc's order on system agreement service schedules mss-1, mss-2, and mss-3, and the potential offsetting cost would be significantly less than that for each of the other utility operating companies. entergy provided to the lpsc an illustrative intra-system bill recalculation as specified by the lpsc for the years 2003, 2004, and 2006, and the lpsc then filed answering testimony in december 2012. in its testimony the lpsc claims that the damages, excluding interest, that should be paid by entergy arkansas to the other utility operating company's customers for 2003, 2004, and 2006 are $42 million to entergy gulf states, inc.,
$7 million to entergy louisiana, $23 million to entergy mississippi, and $4 million to entergy new orleans. the ferc staff and certain intervenors filed direct and answering testimony in february 2013. in april 2013, entergy filed its rebuttal testimony in that proceeding, including a revised illustrative re-run of the intra-system bills for the years 2003, 2004, and 2006. the revised calculation determines the re-pricing of the opportunity sales based on consideration of moveable resources only and the removal of exchange energy received by entergy arkansas, which increases the potential cost for entergy arkansas over the three years 2003, 2004, and 2006 by $2.3 million from the potential costs identified in the utility operating companies' prior filings in september and october
2012. a hearing was held in may 2013 to quantify the effect of repricing the opportunity sales in accordance with the ferc's decision.
in august 2013 the presiding judge issued an initial decision in the calculation proceeding. the initial decision concludes that the methodology proposed by the lpsc, rather than the methodologies proposed by entergy or the ferc staff, should be used to calculate the payments that entergy arkansas is to make to the other utility operating companies. the initial decision also concludes that the other system agreement service schedules should not be adjusted and that payments by entergy arkansas should not be reflected in the rough production cost equalization bandwidth calculations for the applicable years. the initial decision does recognize that the lpsc's methodology would result in an inequitable windfall to the other utility operating companies and, therefore, concludes that any payments by entergy arkansas should be reduced by 20%. the utility operating companies are currently analyzing the effects of the initial decision. the lpsc, apsc, city council, and ferc staff filed briefs on exceptions and/or briefs opposing exceptions. entergy filed a brief on exceptions requesting that ferc reverse the initial decision and a brief opposing certain exceptions taken by the lpsc and ferc staff. the ferc's review of the initial decision is pending. no payments will be made or received by the utility operating companies until the ferc issues an order reviewing the initial decision and entergy submits a subsequent filing to comply with that order.

nuclear matters entergy arkansas owns and operates, through an affiliate, the ano 1 and ano 2 nuclear power plants. entergy arkansas is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating nuclear plants. these include risks from the use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials, regulatory requirement changes, including changes resulting from events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear operations, and technological and financial uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in decommissioning trusts. in the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of either ano 1 or ano 2, entergy arkansas may be required to file with the apsc a rate mechanism to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning.
the nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking of certain materials within the reactor coolant system. the issue is applicable to ano and is managed in accordance with industry standard practices and guidelines that include in-service examinations, replacements, and mitigation strategies.
developments in the industry or identification of issues at the nuclear units could require unanticipated remediation efforts that cannot be quantified in advance.
after the nuclear incident in japan resulting from the march 2011 earthquake and tsunami, the nrc established a task force to conduct a review of processes and regulations relating to nuclear facilities in the united states.
the task force issued a near-term (90-day) report in july 2011 that made initial recommendations, which were subsequently refined and prioritized after input from stakeholders. the task force then issued a second report in september 2011. based upon the task force's recommendations, the nrc issued three orders effective on march 12,
2012. the three orders require u.s. nuclear operators to undertake plant modifications and perform additional analyses that will, among other things, result in increased operating and capital costs associated with operating nuclear plants. the nrc, with input from the industry, is continuing to determine the specific actions required by the orders. entergy arkansas's estimated capital expenditures for 2016 through 2018 for complying with the nrc orders are included in the planned construction and other capital investments estimates given in "

environmental risks entergy arkansas's facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. management believes that entergy arkansas is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.

in 2014, entergy arkansas recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liabilities for ano 1 and ano 2
as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study. the revised estimates resulted in a $47.6 million increase in the decommissioning cost liabilities, along with a corresponding increase in the related asset retirement cost assets that will be depreciated over the remaining lives of the units.
unbilled revenue as discussed in note 1 to the financial statements, entergy arkansas records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month's estimate is reversed. the difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. the estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation.
qualified pension and other postretirement benefits entergy arkansas's qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. see the " qualified pension and other postretirement benefits
" in the "

each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant.
costs and funding total qualified pension cost for entergy arkansas in 2015 was $62.7 million. entergy arkansas anticipates 2016
qualified pension cost to be $37.6 million. in 2016, entergy arkansas refined its approach to estimating the service cost and interest cost components of qualified pension costs, which had the effect of lowering qualified pension costs by $13.3 million. entergy arkansas contributed $92.4 million to its pension plan in 2015 and estimates 2016-2018 pension contributions will approximate $226.1 million, including $82.8 million in 2016, although the 2016 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the january 1, 2016
valuations are completed, which is expected by april 1, 2016.
total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit cost for entergy arkansas in 2015 was $3.2 million.
entergy arkansas expects 2016 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income of approximately $5.9
million. in 2016, entergy arkansas refined its approach to estimating the service cost and interest cost components of other postretirement costs, which had the effect of lowering qualified other postretirement costs by $2.5
million. entergy arkansas contributed $14.7 million to its other postretirement plans in 2015 and expects 2016-2018
contributions to approximate $5.3 million, including $4.2 million in 2016.
the retirement and mortality rate assumptions are reviewed every three-to-five years as part of an actuarial study that compares these assumptions to the actual experience of the pension and other postretirement plans. the 2014
actuarial study reviewed plan experience from 2010 through 2013. as a result of the 2014 actuarial study and the issuance of new mortality tables in october 2014 by the society of actuaries, changes were made to reflect modified demographic pattern expectations as well as longer life expectancies. these changes are reflected in the december
31, 2014 financial disclosures. adoption of the new mortality assumptions for 2015 resulted in an increase at december 31, 2014 of $106.9 million in the qualified pension benefit obligation and $16 million in the accumulated postretirement obligation. the new mortality assumptions increased anticipated 2015 qualified pension cost by approximately $15.4 million and other postretirement cost by approximately $2.2 million. pension funding guidelines, as established by the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended and the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, are not expected to incorporate the october 2014 society of actuaries new mortality assumptions until after 2015, possibly 2016.

table of contents entergy louisiana, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana business combination entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana filed an application with the lpsc in september 2014 seeking authorization to undertake the transactions that would result in the combination of entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana into a single public utility. in the application, entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana identified potential benefits, including enhanced economic and customer diversity, enhanced geographic and supply diversity, and greater administrative efficiency. in the initial proceedings with the lpsc, entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana estimated that the business combination could produce up to $128
million in measurable customer benefits during the first ten years following the transaction's close including proposed guaranteed customer credits of $97 million in the first nine years. in april 2015 the lpsc staff and intervenors filed testimony in the lpsc business combination proceeding. the testimony recommended an extensive set of conditions that would be required in order to recommend that the lpsc find that the business combination was in the public interest. the lpsc staff's primary concern appeared to be potential shifting in fuel costs between entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana customers. in may 2015, entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana filed rebuttal testimony. after the testimony was filed with the lpsc, the parties engaged in settlement discussions that ultimately led to the execution of an uncontested stipulated settlement ("stipulated settlement"), which was filed with the lpsc in july 2015. through the stipulated settlement, the parties agreed to terms upon which to recommend that the lpsc find that the business combination was in the public interest. the stipulated settlement, which was either joined, or unopposed, by all parties to the lpsc proceeding, represents a compromise of stakeholder positions and was the result of an extensive period of analysis, discovery, and negotiation. the stipulated settlement provides $107 million in guaranteed customer benefits during the first nine years following the transaction's close. additionally, the combined company will honor the 2013 entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana rate case settlements, including the commitments that (1) there will be no rate increase for legacy entergy gulf states louisiana customers for the 2014 test year, and (2) through the 2016 test year formula rate plan, entergy louisiana (as a combined entity) will not raise rates by more than $30 million , net of the $10 million rate increase included in the entergy louisiana legacy formula rate plan. the stipulated settlement also describes the process for implementing a fuel-tracking mechanism that is designed to address potential effects arising from the shifting of fuel costs between legacy entergy louisiana and legacy entergy gulf states louisiana customers as a result of the combination of those companies' fuel adjustment clauses.
specifically, the fuel tracker would reallocate such cost shifts as between legacy customers of the companies on an after-the-fact basis, and the calculation of the fuel tracker will be submitted annually in a compliance filing.
the stipulated settlement also provides that entergy gulf states louisiana and entergy louisiana are permitted to defer certain external costs that were incurred to achieve the business combination's customer benefits. the deferred amount, which shall not exceed $25 million , will be subject to a prudence review and amortized over a
10-year period. in 2015 deferrals of $16 million for these external costs was recorded. a hearing on the stipulated settlement in the lpsc proceeding was held in july 2015. in august 2015 the lpsc approved the business combination.
in april 2015 the ferc approved applications requesting authorization for the business combination. in august 2015
the nrc approved the applications for the river bend and waterford 3 license transfers as part of the steps to complete the business combination.
on october 1, 2015, the businesses formerly conducted by entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana were combined into a single public utility. with the completion of the business combination, entergy louisiana holds substantially all of the assets, and has assumed the liabilities, of entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana. the combination was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control. the effect of the business combination has been retrospectively applied to entergy louisiana's financial statements that are presented in this report. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the business combination and related customer credits.

table of contents entergy louisiana, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis results of operations net income
2015 compared to 2014
net income increased slightly, by $0.6 million, primarily due to higher net revenue and a lower effective income tax rate, offset by higher other operation and maintenance expenses, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, lower other income, and higher interest expense.
2014 compared to 2013
net income increased $31.9 million primarily due to higher net revenue and higher other income, partially offset by higher other operation and maintenance expenses, a higher effective income tax rate, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, and higher interest expense.
net revenue
2015 compared to 2014
net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2)

2015 net revenue                                         $2,408.8
the retail electric price variance is primarily due to formula rate plan increases, as approved by the lpsc, effective december 2014 and january 2015. entergy louisiana's formula rate plan increases are discussed in note 2
to the financial statements.
the volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 841 gwh, or 2%, in billed electricity usage, as a result of increased industrial usage primarily due to increased demand for existing large refinery customers, new customers, and expansion projects primarily in the chemicals industry, partially offset by a decrease in demand in the chemicals industry as a result of a seasonal outage for an existing customer.
the waterford 3 replacement steam generator provision is due to a regulatory charge of approximately $32 million recorded in 2015 related to the uncertainty associated with the resolution of the waterford 3 replacement steam generator project. see note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the waterford 3 replacement steam generator prudence review proceeding.
the miso deferral variance is due to the deferral in 2014 of non-fuel miso-related charges, as approved by the lpsc. the deferral of non-fuel miso-related charges is partially offset in other operation and maintenance

2014 net revenue                   $2,246.1
the volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 1,842 gwh, or 4%, in billed electricity usage primarily due to higher industrial usage, primarily in the chemicals industry, and the effect of more favorable weather primarily on residential sales.
the asset retirement obligation affects net revenue because entergy louisiana records a regulatory debit or credit for the difference between asset retirement obligation-related expenses and trust earnings plus asset retirement obligation-related costs collected in revenue. the variance is primarily caused by an increase in regulatory credits because of a decrease in decommissioning trust earnings and an increase in regulatory credits to realign the asset retirement obligation regulatory asset with regulatory treatment.
the miso deferral variance is due to the deferral in 2014 of non-fuel miso-related charges, as approved by the lpsc. the deferral of non-fuel miso-related charges is partially offset in other operation and maintenance expenses. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the recovery of non-fuel miso-related charges.
the retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in affiliated purchased power capacity costs that are recovered through base rates set in the annual formula rate plan mechanism and a formula rate plan increase effective december 2014. entergy louisiana's formula rate plan is discussed in note 2 to the financial statements.
other income statement variances
2015 compared to 2014
nuclear refueling outage expenses decreased primarily due to the amortization of lower expenses associated with the refueling outage at waterford 3.

depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service, including the ninemile unit 6 project, which was placed in service in december 2014.
other income decreased primarily due to a decrease in the allowance for equity funds used during construction due to a higher construction work in progress balance in 2014, which included the ninemile unit 6 project and $7.6

st. charles power station in august 2015, entergy louisiana filed with the lpsc an application seeking certification that the public necessity and convenience would be served by the construction of the st. charles power station, a nominal 980
megawatt combined-cycle generating unit, on land adjacent to the existing little gypsy plant in st. charles parish, louisiana. discovery has begun in the proceeding. testimony has been filed by lpsc staff and intervenors, with lpsc staff concluding that the construction of the project serves the public convenience and necessity. three intervenors contend that entergy louisiana has not established that construction of the project is in the public interest, claiming that the rfp excluded consideration of certain resources that could be more cost effective, that the rfp provided undue preference to the self-build option, and that a 30-year capacity commitment is not warranted by current supply conditions. the rfp independent monitor also filed testimony and a report affirming that the st.
charles power station was selected through an objective and fair rfp that showed no undue preference to any proposal. an evidentiary hearing is scheduled for april 2016 and, subject to regulatory approval by the lpsc, full notice to proceed is expected to be issued in summer 2016. commercial operation is estimated to occur by summer
2019.
union power station purchase agreement in december 2014, entergy arkansas, entergy gulf states louisiana, and entergy texas entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the union power station, a 1,980 mw (summer rating) power generation facility located near el dorado, arkansas, from union power partners, l.p. the union power station consists of four natural gas-fired, combined-cycle gas turbine power blocks, each rated at 495 mw (summer rating). pursuant to the agreement, entergy gulf states louisiana would acquire two of the power blocks and a 50% undivided ownership interest in certain assets related to the facility, and entergy arkansas and entergy texas would each acquire one power block and a 25%
undivided ownership interest in such related assets. the base purchase price is expected to be approximately $948
million (approximately $237 million for each power block) subject to adjustments. the purchase is contingent upon, among other things, obtaining necessary approvals, including cost recovery, from various federal and state regulatory and permitting agencies. under the original terms of the asset purchase agreement, these included regulatory approvals from the apsc, lpsc, puct, and ferc, as well as clearance under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust law.
in december 2014, entergy texas filed its application for certificate of convenience and necessity (ccn) with the puct seeking one of the two necessary puct approvals of the acquisition. based on the opposition to the acquisition of the power block, entergy texas determined it was appropriate to seek to dismiss the ccn filing. in july 2015, entergy texas withdrew its rate case and, together with other parties, filed a motion with the puct to dismiss

in january 2015, entergy gulf states louisiana filed its application with the lpsc for approval of the acquisition and cost recovery. supplemental testimony was submitted in july 2015 explaining the reallocation of one of the power blocks to entergy new orleans and clarifying that entergy gulf states louisiana would own 100% of the capacity and associated energy of two power blocks. in september 2015, entergy gulf states louisiana agreed to settlement terms with all parties for entergy gulf states louisiana's purchase of the two power blocks. in october
2015 the lpsc voted unanimously to approve the uncontested settlement which finds, among other things, that acquisition of power blocks 3 and 4 is in the public interest and, therefore, prudent. the business combination of entergy gulf states louisiana and entergy louisiana received regulatory approval and closed in october 2015 making entergy louisiana the named purchaser of power blocks 3 and 4 of the union power station.
in january 2015, entergy arkansas filed its application with the apsc for approval of the acquisition and cost recovery. a hearing was held in september 2015. in november 2015 the apsc issued an order conditionally approving the acquisition and requesting that entergy arkansas file compliance testimony reporting on two minor conditions.
in january 2016 the apsc issued an order finding that entergy arkansas's december 2015 compliance filing was substantially compliant with its november 2015 order.
in february 2015, entergy arkansas, entergy gulf states louisiana, and entergy texas filed a notification and report form pursuant to the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act with the united states department of justice (doj) and federal trade commission with respect to their planned acquisition of the union power station.
union power partners, l.p. (upp), the seller, also filed a notification and report form in february 2015.

hurricane isaac in august 2012, hurricane isaac caused extensive damage to entergy louisiana's service area. the storm resulted in widespread power outages, significant damage primarily to distribution infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power outages. in january 2013, entergy louisiana drew $252.5 million from its funded storm reserve escrow account. in april 2013, entergy louisiana filed an application with the lpsc relating to hurricane isaac system restoration costs. in may 2013, entergy louisiana and the louisiana utilities restoration corporation (lurc), an instrumentality of the state of louisiana, filed with the lpsc an application requesting that the lpsc grant financing orders authorizing the financing of entergy louisiana's storm costs, storm reserves, and issuance costs pursuant to act 55 of the louisiana regular session of 2007 (louisiana act 55). the lpsc staff filed direct testimony in september 2013 concluding that hurricane isaac system restoration costs incurred by entergy louisiana were reasonable and prudent, subject to proposed minor adjustments which totaled approximately 1% of the company's costs. following an evidentiary hearing and recommendations by the alj, the lpsc voted in june 2014 to approve a series of orders which (i) quantify the amount of hurricane isaac system restoration costs prudently incurred
($290.8 million); (ii) determine the level of storm reserves to be re-established ($290 million); (iii) authorize entergy louisiana to utilize louisiana act 55 financing for hurricane isaac system restoration costs; and (iv)
grant other requested relief associated with storm reserves and act 55 financing of hurricane isaac system restoration costs. entergy louisiana committed to pass on to customers a minimum of $30.8 million of customer benefits through annual customer credits of approximately $6.2 million for five years. approvals for the act 55
financings were obtained from the louisiana utilities restoration corporation (lurc) and the louisiana state bond commission.
in july 2014, entergy louisiana issued two series totaling $300 million of 3.78% series first mortgage bonds due april 2025. entergy louisiana used the proceeds to re-establish and replenish its storm damage escrow reserves and for general corporate purposes.
in august 2014 the louisiana local government environmental facilities and community development authority (lcda)
issued $314.85 million in bonds under act 55 of the louisiana legislature. from the $309.5 million of bond proceeds loaned by the lcda to the lurc, the lurc deposited $16 million in a restricted escrow account as a storm damage reserve for entergy louisiana and transferred $293.5 million directly to entergy louisiana. entergy louisiana used the $293.5 million received from the lurc to acquire 2,935,152.69 class c preferred, non-voting, membership interest units of entergy holdings company llc, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by entergy, that carry a
7.5% annual distribution rate. distributions are payable quarterly commencing on september 15, 2014, and the membership interests have a liquidation price of $100 per unit. the preferred membership interests are callable at the option of entergy holdings company llc after ten years under the terms of the llc agreement. the terms of

table of contents entergy louisiana, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis the membership interests include certain financial covenants to which entergy holdings company llc is subject, including the requirement to maintain a net worth of at least $1.75 billion.
entergy louisiana does not report the bonds on its balance sheet because the bonds are the obligation of the lcda and there is no recourse against entergy louisiana in the event of a bond default. to service the bonds, entergy louisiana collects a system restoration charge on behalf of the lurc, and remits the collections to the bond indenture trustee. entergy louisiana does not report the collections as revenue because it is merely acting as the billing and collection agent for the state.
little gypsy repowering project in april 2007, entergy louisiana announced that it intended to pursue the solid fuel repowering of a 538 mw unit at its little gypsy plant. in march 2009 the lpsc voted in favor of a motion directing entergy louisiana to temporarily suspend the repowering project and, based upon an analysis of the project's economic viability, to make a recommendation regarding whether to proceed with the project. this action was based upon a number of factors including the recent decline in natural gas prices, as well as environmental concerns, the unknown costs of carbon legislation and changes in the capital/financial markets. in april 2009, entergy louisiana complied with the lpsc's directive and recommended that the project be suspended for an extended period of time of three years or more. in may 2009 the lpsc issued an order declaring that entergy louisiana's decision to place the little gypsy project into a longer-term suspension of three years or more is in the public interest and prudent.
in october 2009, entergy louisiana made a filing with the lpsc seeking permission to cancel the little gypsy repowering project and seeking project cost recovery over a five-year period. in june 2010 and august 2010, the lpsc staff and intervenors filed testimony. the lpsc staff (1) agreed that it was prudent to move the project from long-term suspension to cancellation and that the timing of the decision to suspend on a longer-term basis was not imprudent; (2) indicated that, except for $0.8 million in compensation-related costs, the costs incurred should be deemed prudent; (3) recommended recovery from customers over ten years but stated that the lpsc may want to consider 15 years; (4) allowed for recovery of carrying costs and earning a return on project costs, but at a reduced rate approximating the cost of debt, while also acknowledging that the lpsc may consider ordering no return; and (5) indicated that entergy louisiana should be directed to securitize project costs, if legally feasible and in the public interest. in the third quarter 2010, in accordance with accounting standards, entergy louisiana determined that it was probable that the little gypsy repowering project would be abandoned and accordingly reclassified $199.8 million of project costs from construction work in progress to a regulatory asset.
a hearing on the issues, except for cost allocation among customer classes, was held before the alj in november
2010. in january 2011 all parties participated in a mediation on the disputed issues, resulting in a settlement of all disputed issues, including cost recovery and cost allocation. the settlement provides for entergy louisiana to recover $200 million as of march 31, 2011, and carrying costs on that amount on specified terms thereafter. the settlement also provides for entergy louisiana to recover the approved project costs by securitization. in april
2011, entergy louisiana filed an application with the lpsc to authorize the securitization of the investment recovery costs associated with the project and to issue a financing order by which entergy louisiana could accomplish such securitization. in august 2011 the lpsc issued an order approving the settlement and also issued a financing order for the securitization. see note 5 to the financial statements for a discussion of the september

2014 compliance filing are subject to final true-up following completion of the lpsc's determination regarding the prudence of the project. lpsc staff identified five issues, of which two remain. the remaining issues pertain to entergy louisiana's method of collecting the agreed-upon $10 million increase and the level of recovery of investment related to the grand gulf uprate. no procedural schedule has been established, however, to address these remaining issues. the final issue raised by the lpsc staff pertains to the appropriate level of refunds related to the waterford 3 replacement steam generator project. that issue will be resolved in connection with the waterford 3
prudence review proceedings discussed below.
waterford 3 replacement steam generator project following the completion of the waterford 3 replacement steam generator project, the lpsc undertook a prudence review in connection with a filing made by entergy louisiana in april 2013 with regard to the following aspects of the replacement project: 1) project management; 2) cost controls; 3) success in achieving stated objectives; 4) the costs of the replacement project; and 5) the outage length and replacement power costs. in july 2014 the lpsc staff filed testimony recommending potential project and replacement power cost disallowances of up to $71 million, citing a need for further explanation or documentation from entergy louisiana. an intervenor filed testimony recommending disallowance of $141 million of incremental project costs, claiming the steam generator fabricator was imprudent. entergy louisiana provided further documentation and explanation requested by the lpsc staff. an evidentiary hearing was held in december 2014. at the hearing the parties maintained the positions reflected in pre-filed testimony. entergy louisiana believes that the replacement steam generator costs were prudently incurred and applicable legal principles support their recovery in rates. nevertheless, entergy louisiana recorded a write-
off of $16 million of waterford 3's plant balance in december 2014 because of the uncertainty at the time associated with the resolution of the prudence review. in december 2015 the alj issued a proposed recommendation, which was subsequently finalized, concluding that entergy louisiana prudently managed the waterford 3 replacement steam generator project, including the selection, use, and oversight of contractors, and could not reasonably have anticipated the damage to the steam generators. nevertheless, the alj concluded that entergy louisiana was liable for the conduct of its contractor and subcontractor and, therefore, recommended a disallowance of $67 million in capital costs. additionally, the alj concluded that entergy louisiana did not sufficiently justify the incurrence of $2 million in replacement power costs during the replacement outage. although the alj's recommendation has yet to be considered by the lpsc, after considering the progress of the proceeding in light of the alj recommendation, entergy louisiana recorded in the fourth quarter 2015 approximately $77 million in charges, including a $45 million asset write-off and a $32 million regulatory charge, to reflect that a portion of the assets associated with the waterford 3 replacement steam generator project is no longer probable of recovery. entergy louisiana maintains that the alj's recommendation contains significant factual and legal errors.

management's financial discussion and analysis results of operations net income
2015 compared to 2014
net income increased $17.9 million primarily due to the write-off in 2014 of the regulatory assets associated with new nuclear generation development costs as a result of a joint stipulation entered into with the mississippi public utilities staff, subsequently approved by the mpsc, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expenses, higher taxes other than income taxes, higher other operation and maintenance expenses, and lower net revenue. see note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the new nuclear generation development costs and the joint stipulation.
2014 compared to 2013
net income decreased $7.3 million primarily due to the write-off in 2014 of the regulatory asset associated with new nuclear generation development costs as a result of a joint stipulation entered into with the mississippi public utilities staff, subsequently approved by the mpsc, in which entergy mississippi agreed not to pursue recovery of the costs deferred by an mpsc order in the new nuclear generation docket. see note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the new nuclear generation development costs and the joint stipulation. also contributing to the decrease were higher depreciation and amortization expenses and higher taxes other than income taxes. these decreases were significantly offset by higher net revenue and lower other operation and maintenance expenses.
net revenue
2015 compared to 2014
net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2)
purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2015 to 2014.
amount
-in millions
2014 net revenue                   $701.2

2015 net revenue                   $696.3
the volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 86 gwh, or 1%, in billed electricity usage, including the effect of more favorable weather on residential and commercial sales.

management's financial discussion and analysis the retail electric price variance is primarily due to a $16 million net annual increase in revenues, effective february 2015, as a result of the mpsc order in the june 2014 rate case and an increase in the energy efficiency rider, partially offset by a decrease in the storm damage rider. the rate case included the realignment of certain costs from collection in riders to base rates. the increase in the energy efficiency rider and the decrease in the storm damage rider are offset by other operation and maintenance expenses and have a minimal effect on net income.
see note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the rate case, the energy efficiency rider, and the storm damage rider.
the net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to a wholesale customer contract termination in october 2015.
transmission equalization revenue represents amounts received by entergy mississippi from certain other entergy utility operating companies, in accordance with the system agreement, to allocate the costs of collectively planning, constructing, and operating entergy's bulk transmission facilities. the transmission equalization variance is primarily attributable to the realignment, effective february 2015, of these revenues from the determination of base rates to inclusion in a rider. such revenues had a favorable effect on net revenue in 2014, but minimal effect in 2015. entergy mississippi exited the system agreement in november 2015. see " system agreement " in the "

2014 net revenue                   $701.2
the retail electric price variance is primarily due to a formula rate plan increase, as approved by the mpsc, effective september 2013 and an increase in the storm damage rider, as approved by the mpsc, effective october
2013. the increase in the storm damage rider is offset by other operation and maintenance expenses and has no effect on net income. see note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the formula rate plan and storm damage rider.

management's financial discussion and analysis the reserve equalization variance is primarily due to an increase in reserve equalization revenue primarily due to the changes in the entergy system generation mix as a result of entergy arkansas's exit from the system agreement in december 2013.
the transmission equalization variance is primarily due to changes in transmission investment equalization billings under the entergy system agreement compared to the same period in 2013 primarily as a result of entergy arkansas's exit from the system agreement in december 2013.
the volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 86 gwh, or 1%, in billed electricity usage, including the effect of more favorable weather on residential sales as compared to the prior year and an increase in industrial sales. the increase in industrial usage is primarily in the primary metals and pipelines industries.
other income statement variances
2015 compared to 2014
other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to:
•  an increase of $5 million in distribution expenses primarily due to higher vegetation maintenance and higher labor costs in 2015 as compared to 2014;
•  an increase of $4.9 million in energy efficiency costs.  these costs began in fourth quarter 2014 and are recovered through the energy efficiency rider having minimal effect on net income;
•  an increase of $4.8 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses primarily due to a higher scope of work done during plant outages in 2015 as compared to 2014;
•  a $2.6 million loss recognized on the disposition of plant components;
an increase of $1.8 million in costs incurred in 2014 related to baxter wilson (unit 1) repairs, including
•  an offset for expected insurance proceeds and amortization of the repair costs in 2015 that were deferred in
2014 as approved by the mpsc.  see "baxter wilson plant event" below for a discussion of the baxter wilson plant event; and an increase of $1.7 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to an increase in net periodic pension and other postretirement benefits costs as a result of lower discount rates and changes in
•  retirement and mortality assumptions, partially offset by a decrease in the accrual for incentive-based compensation.  see  "critical accounting estimates" below and note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of pension and postretirement benefits costs.
the increase was partially offset by a decrease of $17.6 million in storm damage accruals. see note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of storm cost recovery.
the asset write-off variance is due to the $56.2 million ($36.7 million after-tax) write-off in 2014 of entergy mississippi's regulatory assets associated with new nuclear generation development costs. see note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the new nuclear generation development costs.
taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in ad valorem taxes.
depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service and higher depreciation rates in 2015, as approved by the mpsc.

other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to:
a decrease of $11.6 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to an increase in the discount rates used to determine net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs, other postretirement
•  benefit plan design changes, fewer employees, and a settlement charge recognized in september 2013 related to the payment of lump sum benefits out of the non-qualified pension plan.  see "critical accounting estimates" below and note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of pension and other postretirement benefits costs;
•  a decrease of $7.6 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses primarily due to a lower scope of work done during plant outages in 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013;
•  a decrease of $5.9 million resulting from costs incurred in 2013 related to the now-terminated plan to spin off and merge the utility's transmission business;
a decrease of $5.1 million in implementation costs, severance costs, and curtailment and special termination
•  benefits related to the human capital management strategic imperative in 2014 as compared to 2013.  see the

•  incurred in 2014 compared to the prior year were offset by expected insurance proceeds and the deferral of repair costs, as approved by the mpsc.  see "baxter wilson plant event" below for further discussion.
the decrease was partially offset by:
•  an increase of $10 million in storm damage accruals, as approved by the mpsc, effective october 2013;
•  an increase of $5.1 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 in administration fees related to participation in the miso rto;
•  an increase of $4 million in regulatory, consulting, and legal fees;
•  an increase of $2.3 million in distribution and transmission vegetation maintenance;
•  an increase of $1.3 million due to higher write-offs of uncollectible customer accounts in 2014 as compared to 2013; and
•  several individually insignificant items.
the asset write-off resulted from the $56.2 million ($36.7 million after-tax) write-off in 2014 of the regulatory asset associated with new nuclear generation development costs as a result of a joint stipulation entered into with the mississippi public utilities staff, subsequently approved by the mpsc, in which entergy mississippi agreed not to pursue recovery of the costs deferred by an mpsc order in the new nuclear generation docket. see note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the new nuclear generation development costs and the joint stipulation.
taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in ad valorem taxes in 2014 as compared to prior year and an increase in local franchise taxes due to higher revenues.
depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service.
income taxes the effective income tax rates for 2015, 2014, and 2013 were 40.0%, 42.7%, and 37.7%, respectively. see note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rates.

management's financial discussion and analysis baxter wilson plant event on september 11, 2013, entergy mississippi's baxter wilson (unit 1) power plant experienced a significant unplanned outage event. entergy mississippi completed the repairs to the unit in december 2014. as of december 31, 2014, entergy mississippi incurred $22.3 million of capital spending and $26.6 million of operation and maintenance expenses to return the unit to service. the damage was covered by entergy mississippi's property insurance policy, subject to a $20 million deductible. as of december 31, 2014, entergy mississippi recorded an insurance receivable of $28.2 million for the amount expected to be received from its insurance policy and has received all of its previously-accrued insurance proceeds, with $12.9 million allocated to capital spending and $15.3 million allocated to operation and maintenance expenses. in june 2014, entergy mississippi filed a rate case with the mpsc, which includes recovery of the costs associated with baxter wilson (unit 1) repair activities, net of applicable insurance proceeds. in december 2014 the mpsc issued an order that provided for a deferral of $6 million in other operation and maintenance expenses associated with the baxter wilson outage and that the regulatory asset should accrue carrying costs, with amortization of the regulatory asset to occur over two years beginning in february
2015, and provided that the capital costs will be reflected in rate base. the final accounting of costs to return the unit to service and insurance proceeds will be addressed in entergy mississippi's next formula rate plan filing.

million rate increase for entergy mississippi which, with other adjustments reflected in the stipulation, would have the effect of resetting entergy mississippi's return on common equity to 10.59% when adjusted for performance under the formula rate plan. in august 2013 the mpsc approved the joint stipulation between entergy mississippi and the mississippi public utilities staff authorizing the rate increase effective with september 2013 bills.

•  development in mississippi, it can at that time re-present for consideration by the mpsc only those costs directly associated with the existing early site permit (esp), to the extent that the costs are verifiable and prudent and the esp is still valid and relevant to any such option pursued.  see "new nuclear generation development costs" above for further discussion of the new nuclear generation development costs proceeding and subsequent write-off in 2014 of the regulatory asset related to those costs.
in december 2014 the mpsc issued an order accepting the stipulations in their entirety and approving the revenue adjustments and rate changes effective with february 2015 bills.
in august 2012 the mpsc opened inquiries to review whether the current formulaic methodology used to calculate the return on common equity in both entergy mississippi's formula rate plan and mississippi power company's annual formula rate plan is still appropriate or can be improved to better serve the public interest. the intent of this inquiry and review was for informational purposes only; the evaluation of any recommendations for changes to the existing methodology would take place in a general rate case or in the existing formula rate plan docket. in march
2013 the mississippi public utilities staff filed its consultant's report which noted the return on common equity estimation methods used by entergy mississippi and mississippi power company are commonly used throughout the electric utility industry. the report suggested ways in which the methods used by entergy mississippi and mississippi power company might be improved, but did not recommend specific changes in the return on common equity formulas or calculations at that time. in june 2014 the mpsc expanded the scope of the august 2012 inquiry to study the merits of adopting a uniform formula rate plan that could be applied, where possible in whole or in part, to both entergy mississippi and mississippi power company in order to achieve greater consistency in the plans. the mpsc directed the mississippi public utilities staff to investigate and review entergy mississippi's formula rate plan rider schedule and mississippi power company's performance evaluation plan by considering the merits and deficiencies and possibilities for improvement of each and then to propose a uniform formula rate plan that, where possible, could be applicable to both companies. no procedural schedule has been set. in october 2014 the mississippi public utilities staff conducted a public technical conference to discuss performance benchmarking and its potential application to the electric utilities' formula rate plans.

management's financial discussion and analysis in entergy mississippi's 2014 general rate case, the mississippi public utilities staff conducted a review of entergy mississippi's proposed changes to its formula rate plan and recommended changes in that proceeding that may be duplicative of the review being conducted simultaneously in the above-described formula rate plan docket.
consequently, the mpsc found in the general rate case order that the changes to entergy mississippi's formula rate plan schedule approved in that order are just and reasonable and should remain unchanged by any mpsc action in the above-described formula rate plan docket, but that any provisions of entergy mississippi's formula rate plan schedule not specifically addressed in the general rate case order may be reviewed and changed.
fuel and purchased power cost recovery entergy mississippi's rate schedules include an energy cost recovery rider that is adjusted annually to reflect accumulated over- or under-recoveries. entergy mississippi's fuel cost recoveries are subject to annual audits conducted pursuant to the authority of the mpsc.
entergy mississippi had a deferred fuel balance of $60.4 million as of march 31, 2014. in may 2014, entergy mississippi filed for an interim adjustment under its energy cost recovery rider. the interim adjustment proposed a net energy cost factor designed to collect over a six-month period the under-recovered deferred fuel balance as of march 31, 2014 and also reflected a natural gas price of $4.50 per mmbtu. in may 2014, entergy mississippi and the public utilities staff entered into a joint stipulation in which entergy mississippi agreed to a revised net energy cost factor that reflected the proposed interim adjustment with a reduction in costs recovered through the energy cost recovery rider associated with the suspension of the doe nuclear waste storage fee. in june 2014 the mpsc approved the joint stipulation and allowed entergy mississippi's interim adjustment. in november 2014, entergy mississippi filed its annual redetermination of the annual factor to be applied under the energy cost recovery rider. due to lower gas prices and a lower deferred fuel balance, the redetermined annual factor was a decrease from the revised interim net energy cost factor. in january 2015 the mpsc approved the redetermined annual factor effective january 30, 2015.
entergy mississippi had a deferred fuel over-recovery balance of $58.3 million as of may 31, 2015, along with an under-recovery balance of $12.3 million under the power management rider. pursuant to those tariffs, in july 2015, entergy mississippi filed for interim adjustments under both the energy cost recovery rider and the power management rider to flow through to customers the approximately $46 million net over-recovery over a six-month period. in august 2015, the mpsc approved the interim adjustments effective with september 2015 bills. in november
2015, entergy mississippi filed its annual redetermination of the annual factor to be applied under the energy cost recovery rider. the calculation of the annual factor included a projected over-recovery balance of $48 million projected through january 31, 2016. in january 2016 the mpsc approved the redetermined annual factor effective february 1, 2016. the mpsc further ordered, however, that due to the significant change in natural gas price forecasts since entergy mississippi's filing in november 2015, entergy mississippi shall file a revised fuel factor with the mpsc no later than february 1, 2016. in february 2016, entergy mississippi submitted a revised fuel factor reflecting a natural gas price of $2.45 per mmbtu.
mississippi attorney general complaint the mississippi attorney general filed a complaint in state court in december 2008 against entergy corporation, entergy mississippi, entergy services, and entergy power alleging, among other things, violations of mississippi statutes, fraud, and breach of good faith and fair dealing, and requesting an accounting and restitution. the complaint is wide ranging and relates to tariffs and procedures under which entergy mississippi purchases power not generated in mississippi to meet electricity demand. entergy believes the complaint is unfounded. in december 2008
the defendant entergy companies removed the attorney general's lawsuit to u.s. district court in jackson, mississippi. the mississippi attorney general moved to remand the matter to state court. in august 2012 the district court issued an opinion denying the attorney general's motion for remand, finding that the district court has subject matter jurisdiction under the class action fairness act.
371
table of contents entergy mississippi, inc.
management's financial discussion and analysis the defendant entergy companies answered the complaint and filed a counterclaim for relief based upon the mississippi public utilities act and the federal power act. in may 2009 the defendant entergy companies filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings asserting grounds of federal preemption, the exclusive jurisdiction of the mpsc, and factual errors in the attorney general's complaint. in september 2012 the district court heard oral argument on entergy's motion for judgment on the pleadings.
in january 2014 the u.s. supreme court issued a decision in which it held that cases brought by attorneys general as the sole plaintiff to enforce state laws were not considered "mass actions" under the class action fairness act, so as to establish federal subject matter jurisdiction. one day later the attorney general renewed his motion to remand the entergy case back to state court, citing the u.s. supreme court's decision. the defendant entergy companies responded to that motion reiterating the additional grounds asserted for federal question jurisdiction, and the district court held oral argument on the renewed motion to remand in february 2014. in april 2015 the district court entered an order denying the renewed motion to remand, holding that the district court has federal question subject matter jurisdiction. the attorney general appealed to the u.s. fifth circuit court of appeals the denial of the motion to remand. in july 2015 the fifth circuit issued an order denying the appeal, and the attorney general subsequently filed a petition for rehearing of the request for interlocutory appeal, which was also denied.
the case remains pending in federal district court, awaiting a ruling on the entergy companies' motion for judgment on the pleadings. in december 2015 the district court ordered that the parties submit to the court undisputed and disputed facts that are material to the entergy defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings, as well as supplemental briefs regarding the same. those filings were made in january 2016.
storm damage accrual and storm cost recovery on july 1, 2013, entergy mississippi and the mississippi public utilities staff entered into a joint stipulation, wherein both parties agreed that approximately $32 million in storm restoration costs incurred in 2011 and 2012
were prudently incurred and chargeable to the storm damage provision, while approximately $700,000 in prudently incurred costs were more properly recoverable through the formula rate plan. entergy mississippi and the mississippi public utilities staff also agreed that the storm damage accrual should be increased from $750,000 per month to $1.75 million per month. in september 2013 the mpsc approved the joint stipulation with the increase in the storm damage accrual effective with october 2013 bills. in february 2015, entergy mississippi provided notice to the mississippi public utilities staff that the storm damage accrual would be set to zero effective with the march 2015 billing cycle as a result of entergy mississippi's storm damage accrual balance exceeding $15 million as of january 31, 2015, but will return to its current level when the storm damage accrual balance becomes less than

management's financial discussion and analysis critical accounting estimates the preparation of entergy mississippi's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of entergy mississippi's financial position or results of operations.
unbilled revenue as discussed in note 1 to the financial statements, entergy mississippi records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month's estimate is reversed. the difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. the estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation.
qualified pension and other postretirement benefits entergy mississippi's qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. see the " qualified pension and other postretirement benefits

costs and funding total qualified pension cost for entergy mississippi in 2015 was $16.4 million. entergy mississippi anticipates
2016 qualified pension cost to be $9.5 million. in 2016, entergy mississippi refined its approach to estimating the service cost and interest cost components of qualified pension costs, which had the effect of lowering qualified pension costs by $3.8 million. entergy mississippi contributed $22.5 million to its qualified pension plans in 2015
and estimates 2016-2018 pension contributions will approximate $54 million, including $19.9 million in 2016, although the 2016 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the january 1, 2016
valuations are completed, which is expected by april 1, 2016.
total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income for entergy mississippi in 2015 was $758
thousand. entergy mississippi expects 2016 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income of approximately $1.2 million. in 2016, entergy mississippi refined its approach to estimating the service cost and interest cost components of other postretirement costs, which had the effect of lowering qualified other postretirement costs by $770 thousand. entergy mississippi contributed $661 thousand to its other postretirement plans in 2015 and expects 2016-2018 contributions to approximate $419 thousand, including $140 thousand in 2016.
the retirement and mortality rate assumptions are reviewed every three-to-five years as part of an actuarial study that compares these assumptions to the actual experience of the pension and other postretirement plans. the 2014
actuarial study reviewed plan experience from 2010 through 2013. as a result of the 2014 actuarial study and the issuance of new mortality tables in october 2014 by the society of actuaries, changes were made to reflect modified demographic pattern expectations as well as longer life expectancies. these changes are reflected in the december
31, 2014 financial disclosures. adoption of the new mortality assumptions for 2015 resulted in an increase at december 31, 2014 of $33.5 million in the qualified pension benefit obligation and $4.6 million in the accumulated postretirement obligation. the new mortality assumptions increased anticipated 2015 qualified pension cost by approximately $4.8 million and other postretirement cost by approximately $0.6 million. pension funding guidelines, as established by the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended and the internal revenue code of
1986, as amended, are not expected to incorporate the october 2014 society of actuaries new mortality assumptions until after 2015, possibly 2016.

2015 the lpsc voted unanimously to approve the uncontested settlement which finds, among other things, that acquisition of power blocks 3 and 4 is in the public interest and, therefore, prudent. the business combination of entergy gulf states louisiana and entergy louisiana received regulatory approval and closed in october 2015 making entergy louisiana the named purchaser of power blocks 3 and 4 of the union power station.

as a provision of the settlement agreement approved by the city council in may 2015 providing for the algiers asset transfer, it was agreed that, with limited exceptions, no action may be taken with respect to entergy new orleans's base rates until rates are implemented from a base rate case that must be filed for its electric and gas operations in 2018. this provision eliminated the formula rate plan applicable to algiers operations. the limited exceptions include continued implementation of the remaining two years of the four-year phased-in rate increase for its operations in the algiers area and certain exceptional cost increases or decreases in its base revenue requirement.
an additional provision of the settlement agreement allows for continued recovery of the revenue requirement associated with the capacity and energy from ninemile 6 received by entergy new orleans under a power purchase agreement with entergy louisiana (algiers ppa). the settlement authorizes entergy new orleans to recover the remaining revenue requirement related to the algiers ppa through base rates charged to algiers customers. the settlement also provided for continued implementation of the algiers miso recovery rider.
in addition to the algiers ppa, entergy new orleans has a separate power purchase agreement with entergy louisiana for 20% of the capacity and energy of the ninemile unit 6 generating station (ninemile ppa), which commenced operation in december 2014. initially, recovery of the non-fuel costs associated with the ninemile ppa was authorized through a special ninemile 6 rider billed to only entergy new orleans customers outside of algiers.
in august 2015, entergy new orleans filed an application with the city council seeking authorization to proceed with the acquisition of union power block 1, with an expected base purchase price of approximately $237 million, subject to adjustments, and seeking approval of the recovery of the associated costs. in november 2015 the city council issued written resolutions and an order approving an agreement in principle between entergy new orleans and city council advisors providing that the purchase of union power block 1 and related assets by entergy new orleans is prudent and in the public interest. the city council authorized expansion of the special ninemile 6 rider, discussed above, to cover the non-fuel purchased power from ninemile 6 as well as the revenue requirement associated with the acquisition of union power block 1, upon closing of the transaction. this rider will also include a credit to customers of $4.8 million annually once the deactivation of michoud units 2 and 3 occurs.
a 2008 rate case settlement included $3.1 million per year in electric rates to fund the energy smart energy efficiency programs. in september 2009 the city council approved the energy efficiency programs filed by entergy new orleans. the rate settlement provides an incentive for entergy new orleans to meet or exceed energy savings targets set by the city council and provides a mechanism for entergy new orleans to recover lost contribution to fixed costs associated with the energy savings generated from the energy efficiency programs. in october 2013 the city council approved the extension of the current energy smart program through december 2014. the city council approved the use of $3.5 million of rough production cost equalization funds for program costs. in addition, entergy new orleans will be allowed to recover its lost contribution to fixed costs and to earn an incentive for meeting program goals. in january 2015 the city council approved extending the energy smart program through march
2015 and using $1.2 million of rough production cost equalization funds to cover program costs for the extended period. additionally, the city council approved funding for the energy smart 2 programs from april 2015 through march 2017 using the remainder of the approximately $12.8 million of 2014 rough production cost equalization funds, and with any remaining costs being recovered through the fuel adjustment clause. this funding methodology was modified in november 2015 when the city council directed entergy new orleans to use a combination of guaranteed customer savings related to a prior agreement with the city council and rough production cost equalization funds to cover program costs prior to recovering any costs through the fuel adjustment clause.
fuel and purchased power cost recovery entergy new orleans's electric rate schedules include a fuel adjustment tariff designed to reflect no more than targeted fuel and purchased power costs, adjusted by a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense arising from the

entergy new orleans's gas rate schedules include a purchased gas adjustment to reflect estimated gas costs for the billing month, adjusted by a surcharge or credit similar to that included in the electric fuel adjustment clause, including carrying charges.
storm cost recovery in october 2006, the city council approved a rate filing settlement agreement that, among other things, authorized a $75 million storm reserve for damage from future storms, which will be created over a ten-year period through a storm reserve rider that began in march 2007. these storm reserve funds are held in a restricted escrow account until needed in response to a storm.
in august 2012, hurricane isaac caused extensive damage to entergy new orleans's service area. the storm resulted in widespread power outages, significant damage primarily to distribution infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power outages. total restoration costs for the repair and/or replacement of entergy new orleans's electric facilities damaged by hurricane isaac were $47.3 million . entergy new orleans withdrew $17.4 million from the storm reserve escrow account to partially offset these costs. in february 2014, entergy new orleans made a filing with the city council seeking certification of the hurricane isaac costs. in january 2015 the city council issued a resolution approving the terms of a joint agreement in principle filed by entergy new orleans, entergy louisiana, and the city council advisors determining, among other things, that entergy new orleans's prudently-
incurred storm recovery costs were $49.3 million , of which $31.7 million , net of reimbursements from the storm reserve escrow account, remains recoverable from entergy new orleans's electric customers. the resolution also directs entergy new orleans to file an application to securitize the unrecovered council-approved storm recovery costs of $31.7 million pursuant to the louisiana electric utility storm recovery securitization act (louisiana act
64). in addition, the resolution found that it is reasonable for entergy new orleans to include in the principal amount of its potential securitization the costs to fund and replenish entergy new orleans's storm reserve in an amount that achieves the council-approved funding level of $75 million . in january 2015, in compliance with that directive, entergy new orleans filed with the city council an application requesting that the city council grant a financing order authorizing the financing of entergy new orleans's storm costs, storm reserves, and issuance costs pursuant to louisiana act 64. in april 2015 the city council's utility advisors filed direct testimony recommending that the proposed securitization be approved subject to certain limited modifications, and entergy new orleans filed rebuttal testimony later in april 2015. in may 2015 the parties entered into an agreement in principle and the city council issued a financing order authorizing entergy new orleans to issue storm recovery bonds in the aggregate amount of $98.7 million , including $31.8 million for recovery of entergy new orleans's hurricane isaac storm recovery costs, including carrying costs, $63.9 million to fund and replenish entergy new orleans's storm reserve, and approximately $3 million for estimated up-front financing costs associated with the securitization.
see note 5 to the financial statements for discussion of the issuance of the securitization bonds in july 2015.

critical accounting estimates the preparation of entergy new orleans's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of entergy new orleans's financial position or results of operations.
unbilled revenue as discussed in note 1 to the financial statements, entergy new orleans records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month's estimate is reversed. the difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. the estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation.
qualified pension and other postretirement benefits entergy new orleans's qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. see the " qualified pension and other postretirement benefits
" in the "
critical accounting estimates
" section of entergy corporation and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis for further discussion. because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, entergy's estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant.
costs and funding total qualified pension cost for entergy new orleans in 2015 was $9 million. entergy new orleans anticipates 2016
qualified pension cost to be $5.6 million. in 2016, entergy new orleans refined its approach to estimating the service cost and interest cost components of qualified pension costs, which had the effect of lowering qualified pension costs by $1.7 million. entergy new orleans contributed $10.9 million to its pension plans in 2015 and estimates 2016-2018 pension contributions will approximate $27.8 million, including $10.7 million in 2016, although the 2016 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the january 1, 2016 valuations are completed, which is expected by april 1, 2016.
total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income for entergy new orleans in 2015 was $1.6
million. entergy new orleans expects 2016 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income of approximately $2.8 million. in 2016, entergy new orleans refined its approach to estimating the service cost and interest cost components of other postretirement costs, which had the effect of lowering qualified other postretirement costs by $548 thousand. entergy new orleans contributed $3.7 million to its other postretirement plans in 2015 and expects 2016-2018 contributions to approximate $7.7 million, including $3.7 million in 2016.
the retirement and mortality rate assumptions are reviewed every three-to-five years as part of an actuarial study that compares these assumptions to the actual experience of the pension and other postretirement plans. the 2014
actuarial study reviewed plan experience from 2010 through 2013. as a result of the 2014 actuarial study and the issuance of new mortality tables in october 2014 by the society of actuaries, changes were made to reflect modified demographic pattern expectations as well as longer life expectancies. these changes are reflected in the december
31, 2014 financial disclosures. adoption of the new mortality assumptions for 2015 resulted in an increase at december 31, 2014 of $15 million in the qualified pension benefit obligation and $3.6 million in the accumulated postretirement obligation. the new mortality assumptions increased anticipated 2015 qualified pension cost by approximately $2.2 million and other postretirement cost by approximately $0.4 million. pension funding guidelines, as established by the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended and the internal revenue code of
1986, as amended, are not expected to incorporate the october 2014 society of actuaries new mortality assumptions until after 2015, possibly 2016.

405
table of contents entergy texas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis results of operations net income
2015 compared to 2014
net income decreased $5.2 million primarily due to the asset write-off of its receivable associated with the spindletop gas storage facility and higher other operation and maintenance expenses, partially offset by higher net revenue and a lower effective tax rate.
2014 compared to 2013
net income increased $16.9 million primarily due to higher net revenue and lower other operation and maintenance expenses, partially offset by a higher effective income tax rate, higher taxes other than income taxes, and higher depreciation and amortization expenses.
net revenue
2015 compared to 2014
net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2)
purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2015 to 2014.
amount
-in millions
2014 net revenue                  $611.7
volume/weather                      17.1
retail electric price               11.4

2015 net revenue                  $637.2
the volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase in residential and commercial sales as a result of a 2%
increase in the average number of customers, partially offset by a decrease in sales to industrial customers and the effect of less favorable weather on residential sales. the decrease in industrial sales is primarily due to extended seasonal outages for existing large refinery customers, partially offset by new customers in the transportation industry.
the retail electric price variance is primarily due to an annual base rate increase of $18.5 million, effective april 2014, as a result of the puct's order in the september 2013 rate case, the implementation of the distribution cost recovery rider, as approved by the puct, and an increase in the energy efficiency rider, as approved by the puct, each effective january 2015. energy efficiency revenues are largely offset by costs included in other operation and maintenance expenses and have a minimal effect on net income. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case.
406
table of contents entergy texas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis the transmission revenue variance is primarily due to an increase in the amount of transmission revenues allocated by miso.
the purchased power capacity variance is primarily due to increased expenses due to contract changes and price changes for ongoing purchased power capacity.
2014 compared to 2013
net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2)

2014 net revenue                  $611.7
the purchased power capacity variance is primarily due to a decrease in expenses due to contract changes.
the retail electric price variance is primarily due to an annual base rate increase of $18.5 million, effective april 2014, as a result of the puct's order in the september 2013 rate case. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the puct rate order.
the volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 884 gwh, or 5%, in billed electricity usage, including the effect of more favorable weather on residential sales and increased industrial usage primarily in the petroleum industry as a result of expansions.
the transmission revenue variance is primarily due to changes as a result of the participation in the miso rto in
2014.
the reserve equalization variance is primarily due to an increase in reserve equalization expense as compared to the same period in 2013 primarily due to the changes in the entergy system generation mix compared to the same period in 2013 as a result of the entergy arkansas's exit from the system agreement in december 2013.
the net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to a wholesale customer contract termination in december 2013.
407
table of contents entergy texas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis other income statement variances
2015 compared to 2014
other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to:
•  an increase of $7.5 million in transmission expenses primarily due to an increase in the amount of transmission costs allocated by miso;
•  a net increase of $6.4 million in energy efficiency costs for fixed costs collected from customers. these costs are recovered through the energy efficiency rider and have a minimal effect on net income; and the write-off in the third quarter 2015 of $4.3 million of rate case expenses and acquisition costs related
•  to the proposed union power station acquisition upon entergy texas's withdrawal of its 2015 rate case and dismissal of its certificate of convenience and necessity filing.  see note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of these proceedings.
the asset write-off variance is due to the $23.5 million ($15.3 million net-of-tax) write-off recorded in 2015 of the receivable associated with the spindletop gas storage facility. see note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the write-off.
2014 compared to 2013
other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to:
a decrease of $14.9 million in compensation and benefit costs primarily due to an increase in the discount rates used to determine net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs, other postretirement
•  benefit plan design changes, fewer employees, and a settlement charge in 2013 related to the payment of lump sum benefits out of the non-qualified pension plan.  see "critical accounting estimates"belowand note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of pension and other postretirement benefits costs;
•  a decrease of $7.4 million resulting from costs incurred in 2013 related to the now-terminated plan to spin off and merge the utility's transmission business; and a decrease of $7.1 million resulting from implementation costs, severance costs, and curtailment and special
•  termination benefits in 2013 related to the human capital management strategic imperative.  see the "human capital management strategic imperative" section of entergy corporation and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis for further discussion.
the decrease was partially offset by an increase of $5.9 million primarily due to administration fees in 2014
related to participation in the miso rto.
taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to a reduction in the provision recorded for sales and use taxes in 2013, an increase in local franchise taxes, and an increase in ad valorem taxes.
depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service.
income taxes the effective income tax rates for 2015, 2014, and 2013 were 34.9%, 39.9%, and 34.2%, respectively. see note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rates.

actuarial study reviewed plan experience from 2010 through 2013. as a result of the 2014 actuarial study and the issuance of new mortality tables in october 2014 by the society of actuaries, changes were made to reflect modified demographic pattern expectations as well as longer life expectancies. these changes are reflected in the december
31, 2014 financial disclosures. adoption of the new mortality assumptions for 2015 resulted in an increase at december 31, 2014 of $30.8 million in the qualified pension benefit obligation and $8.2 million in the accumulated postretirement obligation. the new mortality assumptions increased anticipated 2015 qualified pension cost by approximately $4.3 million and other postretirement cost by approximately $1 million. pension funding guidelines, as established by the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended and the internal revenue code of
1986, as amended, are not expected to incorporate the october 2014 society of actuaries new mortality assumptions until after 2015, possibly 2016.

management's financial discussion and analysis system energy's principal asset currently consists of an ownership interest and a leasehold interest in grand gulf.
the capacity and energy from its 90% interest is sold under the unit power sales agreement to its only four customers, entergy arkansas, entergy louisiana, entergy mississippi, and entergy new orleans. system energy's operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its
90% interest in grand gulf pursuant to the unit power sales agreement. payments under the unit power sales agreement are system energy's only source of operating revenues.
results of operations net income
2015 compared to 2014
net income increased $15 million primarily due to a higher effective income tax rate in 2014, partially offset by lower operating revenue resulting from lower rate base as compared to the prior year.
2014 compared to 2013
net income decreased $17.3 million primarily due to a higher effective income tax rate and lower operating revenues resulting from lower rate base as compared with the same period in the prior year, partially offset by higher other regulatory credits. system energy records a regulatory debit or credit for the difference between asset retirement obligation-related expenses and trust earnings plus asset retirement obligation-related costs collected in revenue.
the increase in regulatory credits for 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily caused by increases in depreciation and accretion expenses and regulatory credits recorded in 2014 to realign the asset retirement obligation regulatory asset with regulatory treatment.
income taxes the effective income tax rates for 2015, 2014, and 2013 were 32.3%, 46.4%, and 37.7%, respectively. see note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rates.

period operating activities net cash flow provided by operating activities increased $74.3 million in 2015 primarily due to an increase in income tax refunds of $104 million in 2015 and a decrease of $40.2 million in spending on nuclear refueling outages in 2015. the increase was partially offset by an increase in interest paid on the grand gulf sale-leaseback obligation as a result of the renewal in december 2013. system energy received income tax refunds in 2015 and 2014
in accordance with the entergy corporation and subsidiary companies intercompany income tax allocation agreement.
the income tax refunds in 2015 resulted primarily from the adoption of a new accounting method for income tax purposes in which system energy will treat its nuclear decommissioning costs as production costs of electricity includable in cost of goods sold. see note 3 to the financial statements for further discussion of the adoption of the new accounting method. see note 10 to the financial statements for details on the grand gulf sale-leaseback obligation.
net cash flow provided by operating activities increased $148.6 million in 2014 primarily due to income tax refunds of $10.1 million in 2014 compared to income tax payments of $211.2 million in 2013. the increase was partially offset by spending on the grand gulf refueling outage in 2014 and an increase of $12.9 million in pension contributions in 2014. system energy made income tax payments in 2013 in accordance with the entergy corporation and subsidiary companies intercompany income tax allocation agreement. the income tax payments in 2013 resulted primarily from the reversal of temporary differences for which system energy had previously claimed a tax deduction. see "
critical accounting estimates
" below and note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.
investing activities net cash flow used in investing activities decreased $66.4 million in 2015 primarily due to fluctuations in nuclear fuel activity because of variations from year to year in the timing and pricing of fuel reload requirements in the utility business, material and services deliveries, and the timing of cash payments during the nuclear fuel cycle.
the decrease was partially offset by money pool activity and an increase in nuclear expenditures primarily due to compliance with nrc post-fukushima requirements.
increases in system energy's receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow and system energy's receivable from the money pool increased by $37.6 million in 2015 compared to decreasing by $6.9 million in 2014. the money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the utility subsidiaries' need for external short-term borrowings.

•  the redemption of $70 million of 6.29% series f notes by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity in september 2013; and net borrowings of $20.4 million on the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity's credit facility in
•  2014 compared to net repayments of $40 million on the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity's credit facility in 2013.
the decrease was partially offset by the issuance of $85 million of 3.78% series i notes by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity in october 2013 and an increase of $31.6 million in common stock dividends paid in
2014.

management's financial discussion and analysis capital structure system energy's capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. the decrease in the debt to capital ratio for system energy as of december 31, 2015 is primarily due to the redemptions of long-
term debt, as discussed above.
december 31,2015          december 31,2014
debt to capital              42.3  %                   45.7  %

net debt to net capital      30.5  %                   36.9  %
net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. debt consists of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. capital consists of debt and common equity. net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. system energy uses the debt to capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating system energy's financial condition. system energy uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating system energy's financial condition because net debt indicates system energy's outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand.
uses of capital system energy requires capital resources for:
•  construction and other capital investments;
•  debt maturities or retirements;
•  working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel costs; and
•  dividend and interest payments.

management's financial discussion and analysis in addition to the contractual obligations given above, system energy expects to contribute approximately $20.2
million to its pension plans and approximately $20 thousand to other postretirement plans in 2016, although the
2016 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the january 1, 2016 valuations are completed, which is expected by april 1, 2016. see "
critical accounting estimates
- qualified pension and other postretirement benefits " below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding.
also in addition to the contractual obligations, system energy has $344.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes and payments for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. see note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.
in addition to routine spending to maintain operations, the planned capital investment estimate includes specific investments and initiatives such as nrc post-fukushima requirements and plant improvements.
as a wholly-owned subsidiary, system energy dividends its earnings to entergy corporation at a percentage determined monthly. currently, all of system energy's retained earnings are available for distribution.
sources of capital system energy's sources to meet its capital requirements include:
•  internally generated funds;
•  cash on hand;
•  debt issuances; and
•  bank financing under new or existing facilities.
system energy may refinance, redeem, or otherwise retire debt prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable.
all debt and common stock issuances by system energy require prior regulatory approval. debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indentures and other agreements. system energy has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs.
system energy's receivables from the money pool were as follows as of december 31 for each of the following years.

nuclear matters system energy owns and operates grand gulf. system energy is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating a nuclear plant. these include risks from the use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and low-
level radioactive materials, regulatory requirement changes, including changes resulting from events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear operations, and technological and financial uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in decommissioning trusts. in the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of grand gulf, system energy may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. grand gulf's operating license is currently due to expire in november 2024. in october 2011, system energy filed an application with the nrc for an extension of grand gulf's operating license to 2044, which application is pending.
in june 2012 the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit vacated the nrc's 2010 update to its waste confidence decision, which had found generically that a permanent geologic repository to store spent nuclear fuel would be available when necessary and that spent nuclear fuel could be stored at nuclear reactor sites in the interim without significant environmental effects, and remanded the case for further proceedings. the court concluded that the nrc had not satisfied the requirements of the national environmental policy act (nepa) when it considered environmental effects in reaching these conclusions. the waste confidence decision has been relied upon by nrc license renewal applicants to address some of the issues that the nepa requires the nrc to address before it issues a renewed license. certain nuclear opponents filed requests with the nrc asking it to address the issues raised by the court's decision in the license renewal proceedings for a number of nuclear plants including grand gulf. in august 2012 the nrc issued an order stating that it will not issue final licenses dependent upon the waste confidence decision until the d.c. circuit's remand is addressed, but also stating that licensing reviews and proceedings should continue to move forward. in september 2014 the nrc published a new final waste confidence rule, named continued storage of spent nuclear fuel, that for licensing purposes adopts non-site specific findings concerning the environmental impacts of the continued storage of spent nuclear fuel at reactor sites - for 60
years, 100 years and indefinitely - after the reactor's licensed period of operations. the nrc also issued an order lifting its suspension of licensing proceedings after the final rule's effective date in october 2014. after the final rule became effective, new york, connecticut, and vermont filed a challenge to the rule in the u.s. court of appeals. the final rule remains in effect while that challenge is pending unless the court orders otherwise.
the nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking of certain materials within the reactor coolant system. the issue is applicable to grand gulf and is managed in accordance with industry standard practices and guidelines that include in-service examinations, replacements, and mitigation strategies.
developments in the industry or identification of issues at the nuclear units could require unanticipated remediation efforts that cannot be quantified in advance.
after the nuclear incident in japan resulting from the march 2011 earthquake and tsunami, the nrc established a task force to conduct a review of processes and regulations relating to nuclear facilities in the united states.
the task force issued a near-term (90-day) report in july 2011 that made initial recommendations, which were subsequently refined and prioritized after input from stakeholders. the task force then issued a second report in september 2011. based upon the task force's recommendations, the nrc issued three orders effective in march 2012.
the three
431
table of contents system energy resources, inc.
management's financial discussion and analysis orders require u.s. nuclear operators to undertake plant modifications and perform additional analyses that will, among other things, result in increased operating and capital costs associated with operating nuclear plants. the nrc, with input from the industry, is continuing to determine the specific actions required by the orders. system energy's estimated capital expenditures for 2016 through 2018 for complying with the nrc orders are included in the planned construction and other capital investments estimates given in "

environmental risks system energy's facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. management believes that system energy is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of system energy's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of system energy's financial position or results of operations.
nuclear decommissioning costs see "

critical accounting estimates
" section of entergy corporation and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs.
in the fourth quarter 2015, system energy recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liability for grand gulf as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study. the revised estimate resulted in a $2.5 million reduction in its decommissioning cost liability, along with a corresponding reduction in the related asset retirement cost asset that will be depreciated over the remaining life of the unit.
in the fourth quarter 2014, system energy recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liability for grand gulf as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study. the revised estimate resulted in a $99.9 million increase in its decommissioning liability, along with a corresponding increase in the related asset retirement cost asset that will be depreciated over the remaining life of the unit.
qualified pension and other postretirement benefits system energy's qualified pension and other postretirement reported costs, as described in note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. see the " qualified pension and other postretirement benefits
" in the "
critical accounting estimates
" section of entergy corporation and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis for further discussion. because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, entergy's estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant.
costs and funding total qualified pension cost for system energy in 2015 was $16.6 million. system energy anticipates 2016 qualified pension cost to be $10.8 million. in 2016, system refined its approach to estimating the service cost and interest cost components of qualified pension costs, which had the effect of lowering qualified pension costs by $2.8
million. system energy contributed $20.8 million to its pension plans in 2015 and estimates 2016-2018 pension contributions will approximate $51.5 million, including $20.2 million in 2016, although the 2016 required pension contributions will be known with more certainty when the january 1, 2016 valuations are completed, which is expected by april 1, 2016.
total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for system energy in 2015 were $481 thousand.
system energy expects 2016 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit income to approximate $224
thousand. in 2016, system energy refined its approach to estimating the service cost and interest cost components of other postretirement costs, which had the effect of lowering qualified other postretirement costs by $555
thousand. system energy contributed $260 thousand to its other postretirement plans in 2015 and expects 2016-2018
contributions to approximate $60 thousand, including $20 thousand in 2016.
the retirement and mortality rate assumptions are reviewed every three-to-five years as part of an actuarial study that compares these assumptions to the actual experience of the pension and other postretirement plans. the 2014
actuarial study reviewed plan experience from 2010 through 2013. as a result of the 2014 actuarial study and the issuance of new mortality tables in october 2014 by the society of actuaries, changes were made to reflect modified demographic pattern expectations as well as longer life expectancies. these changes are reflected in the december
31, 2014 financial disclosures. adoption of the new mortality assumptions for 2015 resulted in an increase at december 31, 2014 of $17.7 million in the qualified pension benefit obligation and $3.1 million in the accumulated postretirement obligation. the new mortality assumptions increased anticipated 2015 qualified pension cost by approximately $2.7 million and other postretirement cost by approximately $0.4 million. pension funding guidelines, as established by

table of contents internal control over financial reporting
(entergy corporation, entergy arkansas, entergy louisiana, entergy mississippi, entergy new orleans, entergy texas, and system energy)
the managements of entergy corporation, entergy arkansas, entergy louisiana, entergy mississippi, entergy new orleans, entergy texas, and system energy (individually "registrant" and collectively the "registrants") are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the registrants. each registrant's internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of each registrant's financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
each registrant's management assessed the effectiveness of each registrant's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2015 . in making this assessment, each registrant's management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso) in internal control -
integrated framework. the 2013 coso framework was utilized for management's assessment.
based on each management's assessment and the criteria set forth by the 2013 coso framework, each registrant's management believes that each registrant maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2015 .
the report of deloitte & touche llp, entergy corporation's independent registered public accounting firm, regarding entergy corporation's internal control over financial reporting is included herein. the report of deloitte & touche llp is not applicable to entergy arkansas, entergy louisiana, entergy mississippi, entergy new orleans, entergy texas, and system energy because these registrants are non-accelerated filers.
changes in internal controls over financial reporting under the supervision and with the participation of each registrant's management, including its respective peo and pfo, each registrant evaluated changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31, 2015 and found no change that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.

table of contents attestation report of registered public accounting firm report of independent registered public accounting firm to the board of directors and shareholders of entergy corporation and subsidiaries new orleans, louisiana we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of entergy corporation and subsidiaries (the
"corporation") as of december 31, 2015, based on criteria established in internal control -integrated framework
(2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. the corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in item 9a, internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the corporation's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
in our opinion, the corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in internal control -integrated framework
(2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.
we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the consolidated financial statements of the corporation as of and for the year ended december 31, 2015
and our report dated february 25, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

table of contents cd&a highlights executive compensation programs and practices entergy corporation regularly reviews its executive compensation programs to align them with commonly viewed best practices in the market. following are some highlights of entergy corporation's executive compensation practices:
what entergy corporation does
•  requires a "double trigger" for severance payments or equity acceleration in the event of a change in control
•  maintains a "clawback" policy that goes beyond sarbanes-oxley requirements
•  caps the maximum payout at 200% of target under the long-term performance unit program and under the annual incentive plan for members of the office of the chief executive
•  requires minimum vesting periods for equity based awards
•  targets the long-term compensation mix to give more weight to performance units than to time-based restricted stock and stock options combined
•  settles 100% of long-term performance unit payouts in shares of entergy stock
•  requires executives to hold substantially all equity compensation received from entergy corporation until stock ownership guidelines are met
•  prohibits directors and officers from pledging or entering into hedging or other derivative transactions with respect to their entergy corporation shares
•  mitigates undue risk taking in compensation programs
•  subjects executive officer equity grants to non-compete and non-solicitation covenants what entergy corporation doesn't do
•  no 280(g) tax "gross up" payments in the event of a change in control
•  no tax "gross up" payments on any executive perquisites, other than relocation benefits available to all eligible employees, and club dues for some of the named executive officers
•  no option repricing or cash buy-outs for underwater options under the equity plans
•  no agreements providing for severance payments to executive officers that exceed 2.99 times annual base salary and annual incentive awards without shareholder approval
•  no unusual or excessive perquisites
•  new officers are excluded from participation in the system executive retirement plan
•  no grants of supplemental service credit for newly-hired officers under any of entergy corporation's non-qualified retirement plans entergy corporation's pay for performance philosophy entergy corporation's executive compensation programs are based on a philosophy of pay-for-performance that is embodied in the design of its annual and long-term incentive plans. in keeping with this philosophy approximately
85% of the annual target compensation of entergy corporation's chief executive officer is "at risk," equity or performance-based compensation.
2015 incentive pay outcomes entergy corporation believes that the 2015 pay outcomes for entergy corporation's named executive officers demonstrated the application of its pay for performance philosophy.
annual incentive plan awards awards under entergy corporation's executive annual incentive plan or annual incentive plan are tied to entergy corporation's financial performance through the entergy achievement multiplier (eam), which is the
456
table of contents performance metric used to determine the maximum funding available for awards under the plan. the 2015 eam was determined based in equal part on the success in achieving entergy corporation's operational earnings per share
(eps) and operational operating cash flow (ocf) goals set at the beginning of the year. these goals were approved by the personnel committee at the beginning of the year based on entergy corporation's financial plan and the board's overall goals for entergy corporation and were consistent with its published earnings guidance.
for 2015, the personnel committee, based on a recommendation of the finance committee, determined that management exceeded its operational eps goal of $5.50 per share by $0.50 and exceeded its operational ocf goal of $2.755
billion by $591 million. based on the targets and ranges previously established by the committee, these results would have led to a calculated eam of 184%. however, the committee determined that it was appropriate to adjust the reported results downward, for purposes of evaluating management's degree of success in achieving its financial objectives for 2015, to reflect (i) amounts that had been included in both the financial plan and targets related to the anticipated effect of an adverse litigation outcome that did not materialize in the year, and (ii) certain beneficial effects on operational eps and ocf resulting from impairments that occurred with respect to certain of the wholesale nuclear generating plants in 2015. following these adjustments, the committee determined the entergy achievement multiplier for 2015 to be 156%.
for members of entergy corporation's office of the chief executive, individual awards under the annual incentive plan are determined by the personnel committee. in determining individual executive officer awards, the personnel committee exercised its discretion to reduce awards to all members of the office of the chief executive because it determined that despite entergy corporation's strong financial performance in relation to the goals set at the beginning of the year and management's success executing on entergy corporation's strategies in 2015, management had not fully met the board's expectations with respect to certain aspects of operational performance. in determining the extent of this adjustment for individual officers, the committee took into account the officer's key accountabilities and accomplishments and individual performance executing on entergy corporation's strategies.
this resulted in payouts that ranged from 115% of target to 153% of target for the named executive officers who are members of entergy corporation's office of the chief executive.
after the entergy achievement multiplier was established to determine overall funding for the annual incentive plan, entergy corporation's chief executive officer allocated incentive award funding to individual business units based on business unit results. individual awards were determined for the named executive officers who are not members of the oce by their immediate supervisor based on the individual officer's key accountabilities, accomplishments, and performance. this resulted in payouts that ranged from 153% of target to 200% of target for the named executive officers who are not members of entergy corporation's office of the chief executive.
long-term performance unit program payouts performance under the long-term performance unit program is measured over a three year period by assessing entergy corporation's total shareholder return in relation to the total shareholder return of the companies included in the philadelphia utility index. payouts are based solely on relative performance. although entergy corporation had strong relative total shareholder return for 2014, its total shareholder return did not compare favorably to its peers in the philadelphia utility index for 2013 and 2015. as a result, for the three year performance period ending in 2015, entergy corporation's total shareholder return was at the bottom of the third quartile of the companies in the index, resulting in a payout of 25% of target for the executive officers. payouts were made 100%
in shares of entergy corporation stock that are required to be held by executives until they satisfy the executive stock ownership guidelines.
what entergy corporation pays and why entergy corporation's pay for performance philosophy entergy corporation's executive compensation programs are based on a philosophy of pay for performance that is embodied in the design of its annual and long-term incentive plans. entergy corporation believes the executive pay programs described in this section and in the accompanying tables have played a material role in its ability to drive
457
table of contents strong financial and operational results and to attract and retain a highly experienced and successful management team. the annual incentive plan incentivizes and rewards the achievement of operational financial metrics that are deemed by the personnel committee to be consistent with the overall goals and strategic direction that the board has approved for entergy corporation. the long-term incentive programs further align the interests of entergy corporation executives and its shareholders by directly tying the value of the equity awards granted to executives under these programs to the performance of entergy corporation's stock price and its total shareholder return. by incentivizing officers to achieve important financial and operational objectives and create long-term shareholder value, these programs play a key role in creating sustainable value for the benefit of all of entergy corporation's stakeholders including its shareholders, customers, employees and communities.
how entergy corporation sets target pay to develop a competitive compensation program, the personnel committee annually reviews compensation data from two sources:
survey data the committee uses published and private compensation survey data to develop marketplace compensation levels for entergy corporation's executive officers. the data, which are compiled by pay governance, llc, the committee's independent compensation consultant, compare the current compensation opportunities provided to each of the executive officers against the compensation opportunities provided to executives holding similar positions at companies with corporate revenues similar to entergy corporation's. for non-industry specific positions such as a chief financial officer, the committee reviews general industry data for total cash compensation (base salary and annual incentive) since the market for talent is broader than the utility sector. for management positions that are industry-specific, such as group president, utility operations, the committee reviews data from utility companies for total cash compensation. however, for long-term incentives, all positions are reviewed relative to utility market data. the survey data reviewed by the committee cover hundreds of companies across a broad range of industries and approximately 60 investor-owned utility companies. in evaluating compensation levels against the survey data, the committee considers only the aggregated survey data. the identities of the companies participating in the compensation survey data are not disclosed to, or considered by, the committee in its decision-making process and, thus, are not considered material by the committee.
the committee uses this survey data to develop compensation opportunities that are designed to deliver total target compensation at approximately the 50 th percentile of the surveyed companies in the aggregate. the survey data are the primary data used for purposes of assessing target compensation. as a result, mr. denault, entergy corporation's chief executive officer, is compensated at a higher level than the other named executive officers, reflecting market practices that compensate chief executive officers at greater potential compensation levels with more pay "at risk" than other named executive officers, due to the greater responsibilities and accountability required of a chief executive officer. in most cases, the committee considers its objectives to have been met if the chief executive officer and the eight (8) other executive officers who constitute what entergy corporation refers to as the office of the chief executive each has a target compensation opportunity that falls within the range of 85% - 115% of the 50th percentile of the survey data. promoted officers or officers who are new to their roles may be transitioned into the targeted market range over time. actual compensation received by an individual officer may be above or below the targeted range based on an individual officer's skills, performance, experience, and responsibilities, entergy corporation performance, and internal pay equity. for 2015, the total target compensation of each of the named executive officers fell within the targeted range.
proxy analysis although the survey data described above are the primary data used in determining compensation, the committee reviews data derived from the proxy statements of companies included in the philadelphia utility index as an additional point of comparison. the proxy data are used to compare the compensation levels of the named executive officers with the compensation levels of the corresponding top five highest paid executive officers of the
458
table of contents companies included in the philadelphia utility index, as reported in their proxy statements, based on pay rank and without regard to roles and responsibilities, except with respect to the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, for whom comparable roles are used. the personnel committee uses this analysis to evaluate the overall reasonableness of entergy corporation's compensation programs. the following companies were included in the philadelphia utility index at the time the proxy data from the 2015 filings were compiled:

term incentives. incentives are designed to drive overall corporate performance, specific business unit strategies, and individual performance using performance and operational measures the committee believes correlate to shareholder value and align with entergy corporation's strategic vision and operating priorities. the committee establishes the performance measures and ranges of performance for the variable compensation elements. an individual's award is based primarily on corporate performance, market-based compensation levels, and individual performance.

460
table of contents officers, their salaries are established by their immediate supervisors using the same criteria. the committee also considers internal pay equity; however, the committee has not established any predetermined formula against which the base salary of one named executive officer is measured against another officer or employee.
in 2015, all of the named executive officers received merit increases in their base salaries ranging from 2.3% to
5.4%. the increases in base salary were made in light of current economic conditions and the projected growth in executive salaries in 2015 based on the market data previously discussed in this cd&a under "what entergy corporation pays and why - how entergy corporation sets target pay," as well as an internal pay equity comparison.
the following table sets forth the 2014 and 2015 base salaries for the named executive officers. changes in base salaries for 2015 were effective in april.

annual incentive plan entergy corporation includes performance-based incentives in the named executive officers' compensation packages because it believes performance-based incentives encourage the named executive officers to pursue objectives consistent with the overall goals and strategic direction that the board has approved for entergy corporation.
under the annual incentive plan, entergy corporation uses a performance metric known as the entergy achievement multiplier to determine the maximum funding available under the plan, expressed as a percentage of target. for
2015, the target annual incentive plan opportunities for each of the named executive officers, expressed as a percentage of the officer's base salary were:
•  125% for mr. denault;
•  70% for mr. bunting, mr. marsh, and mr. west;
•  60% for mr. may;
•  50% for mr. mcdonald; and
•  40% for mr. fisackerly, ms. rainer, and mr. rice.
the target opportunities established for these officers were comparable to the target opportunities historically set for these positions and levels of responsibility, except for the target opportunity for mr. denault's, which was increased by the personnel committee from 120% to 125% of base salary for 2015 to align it with target opportunities of other chief executive officers, based on the compensation survey data compiled by pay governance.
target opportunities for the named executive officers who are members of the office of chief executive are established by the personnel committee. these named executive officers may earn a maximum payout ranging from 0% to
200% of their target opportunity, calculated as described in the table below. the target awards for the other named executive officers were set by their supervisor (subject to ultimate approval of entergy corporation's chief executive officer) who was allocated funds for such awards by the chief executive officer based on business unit results.
target award opportunities are set based on an executive officer's position and executive management level within the entergy organization. executive management levels at entergy range from level 1 through level 4. at
461
table of contents december 31,2015, mr. denault held a level 1 position, messrs. bunting, marsh, and west held positions in level 2, mr. may held a level 3 position and the remaining named executive officers held positions in level 4. accordingly, their respective incentive award opportunities differ from one another based on their management level and the external market data developed by the committee's independent compensation consultant.
each year the personnel committee reviews the performance measures used to determine the entergy achievement multiplier. in december 2014, the personnel committee decided to retain for 2015 the performance measures used for determining the 2014 entergy achievement multiplier. these measures were operational earnings per share (eps) and operational operating cash flow (ocf), with each measure weighted equally. the committee considered a variety of other potential measures, but determined that operational eps and ocf continued to be the best metrics to use because, among other things, they are objective measures that entergy corporation investors consider to be important in evaluating entergy corporation's financial performance and because the goals in that regard are broadly communicated both internally and externally. this provides both discipline and transparency that the committee believes are important objectives of any well designed incentive compensation plan.
the personnel committee also engages in a rigorous process each year to establish the targets for the annual incentive plan with a goal of establishing target achievement levels that are consistent with entergy corporation's strategy and business objectives for the upcoming year, as reflected in its financial plan, and sufficient to drive results that represent a high level of achievement for entergy corporation, taking into consideration the applicable business environment and specific challenges facing it. these targets are approved based on a comprehensive review by the full board of entergy corporation's financial plan, including changes in commodity market conditions and other key drivers of anticipated changes in performance from the preceding year. the committee further confirms that the targets it approves are aligned with the earnings guidance that will be communicated to the financial markets, which assures that the internal targets set for purposes of the incentive compensation plans are aligned with the external expectations set and communicated to entergy corporation's shareholders.
in january 2015, after full board review of management's 2015 financial plan for entergy corporation and engaging in the process discussed above, the committee determined the annual incentive plan targets to be used for purposes of determining annual incentive plan awards for 2015. in keeping with its past practice, the committee also determined that for purposes of measuring performance against such targets, the committee would exclude the effect on reported results of any major storms that may occur during the year. this exclusion was viewed by the committee as appropriate because although entergy corporation includes estimates for minor storm events in its financial plan, it does not include estimates for a major storm event, such as a hurricane.
in determining the targets to set for 2015, the committee reviewed anticipated drivers for operational eps and ocf for 2015 as set forth in entergy corporation's financial plan. operational eps was expected to decline somewhat from 2014 due primarily to lower expected earnings from the ewc business as a result of substantially lower wholesale power prices and the absence of revenue from the vermont yankee, which shut down at the end of 2014, partially offset by expected utility sales growth and a lower anticipated tax rate in 2015. operational ocf also was expected to decline from 2014 due to, among other things, higher tax payments, the absence of securitization proceeds received in 2014 from hurricane isaac securitizations, and the cash effect of an anticipated adverse litigation outcome. based on this review, the personnel committee set the operational eps and ocf targets for 2015, which targets aligned with entergy corporation's financial plan and its financial guidance for 2015 that was subsequently communicated to investors.

in january 2016, the finance and personnel committees jointly reviewed entergy corporation's financial results against the performance objectives reflected in the table above. management discussed with the committees entergy corporation's operational eps and ocf results for 2015, including primary factors explaining how those results compared to the 2015 business plan and annual incentive plan targets. operational eps for 2015 exceeded the target of $5.50 per share by $0.50, while operational ocf exceeded the target of $2.755 billion by approximately $592
million, leading to a calculated eam of 184%. however, the committee determined that it was appropriate to adjust the reported results downward, for purposes of evaluating management's degree of success in achieving its financial objectives for 2015, to reflect (i) amounts that had been included in both the financial plan and targets related to the anticipated effect of an adverse litigation outcome that did not materialize in the year, and (ii) certain beneficial effects on operational eps and ocf resulting from impairments that occurred with respect to certain of entergy corporation's wholesale nuclear generating plants in 2015. the committee considered it appropriate to exclude these beneficial effects from the reported results in keeping with the classification of the related impairments as a special item in 2015, which meant that they were excluded from operational results. following these adjustments, the committee determined the entergy achievement multiplier for 2015 to be 156%. the committee also reviewed the special items that had been excluded from as-reported eps and ocf to determine operational eps and ocf, which included asset impairments and related write-offs at ewc related to the 2015 decision to close two nuclear generating plants, a gain on the sale by ewc of a natural gas-fired generating plant, and certain costs associated with nuclear plant closings.
for members of entergy corporation's office of chief executive, individual awards under the annual incentive plan are determined by the personnel committee. in determining individual executive officer awards under the annual incentive plan, the committee considered individual performance and, in particular, whether there were additional factors beyond those captured by the eam measures that should be taken into account in determining whether to exercise negative discretion to reduce awards below the levels determined by the eam. the committee determined that in general, despite entergy corporation's strong financial performance in relation to plan and management's success executing on its strategies in 2015, a negative adjustment was appropriate with respect to all of the members of the office of the chief executive as a result of management's failure to fully meet the board's expectations with respect to certain aspects of entergy corporation's operational performance. in determining the extent of this adjustment for individual officers, the committee took into account the officer's key accountabilities and accomplishments and individual performance executing on entergy corporation's strategies. this resulted in payouts that ranged from 115% of target to 153% of target for named executive officers who are members of entergy corporation's office of the chief executive.
after the entergy achievement multiplier was established to determine overall funding for the annual incentive plan, entergy corporation's chief executive officer allocated incentive award funding to individual business units based on business unit results. individual awards were determined for the named executive officers who are
463
table of contents not members of the office of chief executive by their immediate supervisor based on the individual officer's key accountabilities, accomplishments, and performance. this resulted in payouts that ranged from 153% of target to
200% of target for the named executive officers who are not members of entergy's office of chief executive.
based on the foregoing evaluation of management performance, the personnel committee approved the following annual incentive plan payouts to each named executive officer for 2015:

long-term incentive compensation entergy corporation's goal for its long-term incentive compensation is to focus the executive officers on building shareholder value and to increase the executive officers' ownership of entergy corporation common stock in order to more closely align their interest with those of entergy corporation's shareholders. in its long-term incentive compensation program, entergy corporation uses a mix of performance units, restricted stock, and stock options.
performance units reward the named executive officers on the basis of total shareholder return, which is a measure of stock price appreciation and dividend payments, in relation to the companies in the philadelphia utility index.
restricted stock ties the executive officers' long-term financial interest to the long-term financial interests of entergy corporation's shareholders. stock options provide a direct incentive to increase the value of entergy corporation's common stock. in general, entergy corporation seeks to allocate the total value of long-term incentive compensation 60% to performance units and 40% to a combination of stock options and restricted stock, equally divided in value, based on the value the compensation model seeks to deliver. awards for individual named executive officers may vary from this target as a result of individual performance, promotions, and internal pay equity.
all of the performance units, shares of restricted stock, and stock options granted to the named executive officers in 2015 were awarded under the 2011 equity ownership plan and long-term cash incentive plan ("2011 equity ownership plan"), except for mr. marsh's restricted stock unit grant described below which was granted pursuant to the 2015
equity ownership plan (together with the 2011 equity ownership plan, the "equity ownership plans"). the equity ownership plans require both a change in control and an involuntary job loss or substantial diminution of duties (a
"double trigger") for the acceleration of these awards upon a change in control.
performance unit program entergy corporation issues performance unit awards to the named executive officers under its long-term performance unit program. each performance unit represents the value of one share of entergy corporation common stock at the end of the three-year performance period, plus dividends accrued during the performance period. the personnel committee sets payout opportunities for the program at the outset of each performance period, and the program is structured to reward named executive officers only if performance goals approved by the personnel committee are met. the personnel committee has no discretion to make awards if minimum performance goals are not achieved.
464
table of contents the performance units granted under the long-term performance unit program and accrued dividends on any shares earned during the performance period are settled in shares of entergy corporation common stock rather than cash.
all shares paid out under the long-term performance unit program are required to be retained by the officers until applicable executive stock ownership requirements are met.
the long-term performance unit program specifies a minimum, target, and maximum achievement level, the achievement of which will determine the number of performance units that may be earned by each participant. entergy corporation measures performance by assessing its total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder return of the companies in the philadelphia utility index, referred to as entergy corporation's peer companies. the personnel committee identified the philadelphia utility index as the appropriate industry peer group for this purpose because the companies included in this index, in the aggregate, approximate entergy corporation in terms of business and scale. the personnel committee chose relative total shareholder return as a measure of performance because it reflects the creation of shareholder value relative to other electric utilities over the performance period. it also takes into account dividends paid by the companies in this index and normalizes certain events that affect the industry as a whole. minimum, target, and maximum performance levels are determined by reference to the ranking of entergy corporation's total shareholder return against the total shareholder return of the companies in the philadelphia utility index.
performance unit program grants . at any given time, a participant in the long-term performance unit program may be participating in up to three performance periods. currently, eligible participants are participating in the
2014-2016, the 2015-2017, and the 2016-2018 performance periods. subject to achievement of the applicable performance levels as described below, the personnel committee established the following target performance unit payout opportunities for each of the 2013-2015, 2014-2016, and 2015-2017 performance periods.

payouts between minimum and target and between target and maximum are calculated by interpolating between the performance of the company in the bottom position of the third quartile and the median or between the median and the performance of the company at the bottom position of the top quartile of the peer companies, respectively. for top quartile performance, a maximum payout of 200% of target is earned.

table of contents for the 2015 - 2017 performance cycle, there also is no payout for performance that falls within the lowest quartile of performance of the peer companies and for top quartile performance a maximum payout of 200% of target is earned. however, payouts between minimum and target and between target and maximum are calculated by interpolating between the performance of the company at the top of the fourth quartile of performance of the peer companies and the median or between the median and the performance of the company at the bottom position of the top quartile of performance of the peer companies, respectively.
payout for the 2013-2015 performance period. in january 2016, the committee reviewed entergy corporation's total shareholder return for the 2013-2015 performance period in order to determine the payout to participants for the
2013-2015 performance period. the committee compared entergy corporation's total shareholder return against the total shareholder return of the companies that comprise the philadelphia utility index, with the performance measures and range of potential payouts for the 2013-2015 performance similar to the range of payouts discussed above. as recommended by the finance committee, the personnel committee determined that entergy corporation's relative total shareholder return fell at the bottom of the third quartile of the philadelphia utility index for the 2013-2015 performance period, resulting in payouts to the named executive officers of 25% of target. payouts under the performance unit program are made in shares of entergy common stock. for the 2013-2015 performance period, the following numbers of shares of entergy corporation common stock were issued:
mr. denault - 10,644 shares, mr. marsh - 2,132 shares, mr. bunting and mr. west - 2,177 shares;
mr. may - 849 shares; and mr. fisackerly, mr. mcdonald, ms. rainer, and mr. rice - 544 shares stock options and restricted stock entergy corporation grants stock options and restricted stock as part of its long-term incentive program to its executive officers. as previously discussed, the personnel committee considers several factors in determining the number of stock options and shares of restricted stock it will grant to the named executive officers, including individual performance, internal equity, prevailing market practice, targeted long-term value created by the use of stock options and restricted stock, and the potential dilutive effect of stock option and restricted stock grants.
the committee's assessment of individual performance of each named executive officer is the most important factor in determining the number of shares of restricted stock and stock options awarded, except with respect to the chief executive officer for whom comparative market data is the most important factor. the committee, in consultation with entergy corporation's chief executive officer, reviews each other named executive officer's performance, role and responsibilities, strengths, and developmental opportunities. stock option and restricted stock awards for entergy corporation's chief executive officer are determined solely by the personnel committee on the basis of the same considerations. mr. denault's 2015 awards are comparable to historical awards granted to entergy corporation's chief executive officer and reflect the increased stock price at the time of grant. for all equity awards, the committee also considers entergy corporation's significant achievements for the prior year.

restricted stock units restricted stock units granted under the 2015 equity ownership plan represent phantom shares of entergy corporation common stock (i.e., non-stock interests that have an economic value equivalent to a share of entergy corporation common stock). entergy corporation occasionally grants restricted units for retention purposes, to offset forfeited compensation from a previous employer or for other limited purposes. if all conditions of the grant are satisfied, restrictions on the restricted units lift at the end of the restricted period and the restricted stock units are settled in shares of entergy corporation common stock. restricted stock units are generally time-based awards for which restrictions lift, subject to continued employment, generally over a two- to five-year period.
in august 2015, the personnel committee granted mr. marsh 21,100 restricted stock units. mr. marsh's award was made in recognition of mr. marsh's senior leadership role and direction as entergy corporation's executive vice president and chief financial officer and to encourage retention of his leadership in light of his marketability as a chief financial officer. the committee noted, based on the advice of its independent consultant, that such grants are an effective means for retention. mr. marsh's restricted stock units will vest in one installment on august 3,
2020 subject to earlier vesting upon death or disability or during a change in control period (as defined in the
2015 equity ownership plan) upon termination of employment by mr. marsh with good reason or a termination of employment by entergy without cause.

table of contents benefits and perquisites entergy's named executive officers are eligible to participate in or receive the following benefits:
plan type                  description entergy corporation-sponsored:
-defined benefit pension plan, a tax qualified final average pay that covers a broad agroup of employees;
retirement plans           -pension equalization plan, a non-qualified restoration plan; and
-system executive retirement plan, a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan.
see the 2015 pension benefits table for additional information regarding the operation of the plans described above.
savings plan               entergy corporation-sponsored 401(k) savings plan that covers a broad group of employees.
medical, dental, and vision coverage, life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, business travel accident insurance, and long-term disability insurance.
health & welfare benefits  eligibility, coverage levels, potential employee contributions, and other plan design features are the same for the named executive officers as for the broad employee population.
corporate aircraft usage, annual physical exams and event tickets.  named executive officers who are not members of the office of chief executive were provided in 2015
2015 perquisites           with club dues and tax gross up payment on some perquisites.  for additional information regarding perquisites, see the "all other compensation" column in the
2015 summary compensation.
the named executive officers are eligible to defer up to 100% of their base salary deferred compensation      and annual incentive plan awards into the entergy corporation-sponsored executive deferred compensation plan eligible individuals who become disabled under the terms of the plan are eligible executive disability plan  for 65% of the difference between their base salary and $276,923 (i.e. the base salary that produces the maximum $15,000 monthly disability payment under the general long-term disability plan).
entergy corporation provides these benefits to its named executive officers as part of providing a competitive executive compensation program and because it believes that these benefits are important retention and recruitment tools since many, if not all, of the companies with which entergy corporation competes for executive talent provide similar arrangements to their senior executive officers.
agreements and post-termination plans post-termination agreements and other compensation arrangements the committee believes that retention and transitional compensation arrangements are an important part of overall compensation. the committee believes that these arrangements help to secure the continued employment and dedication of the named executive officers, notwithstanding any concern that they might have at the time of a change in control regarding their own continued employment. in addition, the committee believes that these arrangements are important as recruitment and retention devices, as all or nearly all of the companies with which entergy corporation competes for executive talent have similar arrangements in place for their senior employees.
to achieve these objectives, entergy corporation has established a system executive continuity plan under which each of the named executive officers is entitled to receive "change in control" payments and benefits if such officer's employment is involuntarily terminated in connection with a change in control of entergy corporation.
severance payments under the system executive continuity plan are based on a multiple of the sum of an executive
468
table of contents officer's annual base salary plus his or her average annual incentive plan award for the two fiscal years immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the termination of employment occurs. under no circumstances can this multiple exceed 2.99 times the sum of (a) the executive officer's annual base salary as in effect at any time within one year prior to the commencement of a change in control period or if higher, immediately prior to a circumstance constituting good reason plus (b) his or her annual incentive, calculated using the average annual target opportunity derived under the annual incentive plan for the two calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which the officer's termination occurs, or if higher the annual incentive award actually received under the annual incentive plan for the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the termination of employment occurs. entergy corporation strives to ensure that the benefits and payment levels under the system executive continuity plan are consistent with market practices. entergy corporation's executive officers, including the named executive officers, will not receive any tax gross up payments on any severance benefits received under this plan. for more information regarding the system executive continuity plan, see "2015 potential payments upon termination of change in control - system executive continuity plan."
in certain cases, the committee may approve the execution of a retention agreement with an individual executive officer. these decisions are made on a case by case basis to reflect specific retention needs or other factors, including market practice. if a retention agreement is entered into with an individual officer, the committee considers the economic value associated with that agreement in making overall compensation decisions for that officer. entergy corporation has voluntarily adopted a policy that any employment or severance agreements providing severance benefits in excess of 2.99 times the sum of an officer's annual base salary and annual incentive award
(other than the value of the vesting or payment of an outstanding equity-based award or the pro rata vesting or payment of an outstanding long-term incentive award) must be approved by entergy corporation shareholders.
entergy corporation currently has a retention agreement with mr. denault. in general, mr. denault's retention agreement provides for certain payments and benefits in the event of his termination of employment by entergy other than for cause, by mr. denault for good reason or on account of his death or disability. as a result of mr. denault reaching age 55, certain severance payment provisions in his retention agreement no longer apply. mr. denault will not receive tax gross up payments on any payments or benefits he may receive under his agreement. mr. denault's retention agreement was entered into in 2006 when he was entergy corporation's chief financial officer and was designed to reflect the competition for chief financial officer talent in the marketplace at that time and the personnel committee's assessment of the critical role this position played in executing entergy corporation's long-
term financial and other strategic objectives. based on the market data provided by its former independent compensation consultant, the committee believes the benefits and payment levels under mr. denault's retention agreement are consistent with market practices. for additional information regarding the system executive continuity plan and mr. denault's retention agreement described above, see "2015 potential payments upon termination or change in control."
compensation policies and practices entergy corporation strives to ensure that its compensation philosophy and practices are in line with the best practices of companies in the utility industry as well as other companies in the s&p 500. some of these practices include the following:
clawback provisions entergy corporation has adopted a clawback policy that covers all individuals subject to section 16 of the exchange act, including all of the members of the office of the chief executive. under the policy, the committee will require reimbursement of incentives paid to these executive officers where:
(i) the payment was predicated upon the achievement of certain financial results with respect to the applicable performance period that were subsequently determined to be the subject of a material restatement
•  other than a restatement due to changes in accounting policy; or (ii) a material miscalculation of a performance award occurs, whether or not the financial statements were restated and, in either such case, a lower payment would have been made to the executive officer based upon the restated financial results or correct calculation; or
469
table of contents in the board of directors' view, the executive officer engaged in fraud that caused or partially caused the
•  need for a restatement or caused a material miscalculation of a performance award, in each case, whether or not the financial statements were restated.
the amount the committee requires to be reimbursed is equal to the excess of the gross incentive payment made over the gross payment that would have been made if the original payment had been determined based on the restated financial results or correct calculation. further, following a material restatement of the financial statements, entergy corporation will seek to recover any compensation received by its chief executive officer and chief financial officer that is required to be reimbursed under section 304 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002.
stock ownership guidelines and share retention requirements for many years, entergy corporation has had stock ownership guidelines for executives, including the named executive officers. these guidelines are designed to align the executives' long-term financial interests with those of shareholders. annually, the personnel committee monitors the executive officers' compliance with these guidelines.

trading controls and anti-pledging and anti-hedging policies executive officers, including the named executive officers, are required to receive the permission of entergy corporation's general counsel prior to entering into any transaction involving its securities, including gifts, other than the exercise of employee stock options. trading is generally permitted only during open trading windows occurring immediately following the release of earnings. employees, who are subject to trading restrictions, including the named executive officers, may enter into trading plans under rule 10b5-1 of the exchange act, but these trading plans may be entered into only during an open trading window and must be approved by entergy corporation. the named executive officer bears full responsibility if he or she violates this policy by permitting shares to be bought or sold without pre-approval or when trading is restricted.
entergy corporation also prohibits its directors and executive officers, including the named executive officers, from pledging any entergy corporation securities or entering into margin accounts involving entergy corporation securities. it prohibits these transactions because of the potential that sales of entergy corporation securities could occur outside trading periods and without the required approval of the general counsel.
entergy corporation has also adopted an anti-hedging policy that prohibits officers, directors, and employees from entering into hedging or monetization transactions involving its common stock. prohibited transactions include, without limitation, zero-cost collars, forward sale contracts, purchase or sale of options, puts, calls, straddles, or equity swaps, or other derivatives that are directly linked to entergy corporation's stock or transactions involving "short-sales" of its stock. the board adopted this policy to require officers, directors, and employees to continue to own

roles and responsibilities role of the personnel committee the personnel committee has overall responsibility for approving the compensation program for the named executive officers and makes all final compensation decisions regarding entergy corporation's named executive officers. the committee works with entergy corporation's executive management to ensure that its compensation policies and practices are consistent with entergy corporation's values and support the successful recruitment, development, and retention of executive talent so entergy corporation can achieve its business objectives and optimize its long-term financial returns. each year, entergy corporation's senior vice president, human resources and chief diversity officer presents the proposed compensation model for the following year, including the compensation elements, mix of elements and measures for each element, and consults with entergy corporation's chief executive officer on recommended compensation for senior executives. the committee evaluates executive pay each year to ensure that the compensation policies and practices are consistent with entergy corporation's philosophy. the personnel committee is responsible for, among its other duties, the following actions related to the named executive officers:
•  developing and implementing compensation policies and programs for hiring, evaluating, and setting compensation for the executive officers, including any employment agreement with an executive officer;
•  evaluating the performance of entergy corporation's chairman and chief executive officer; and
•  reporting, at least annually, to the board on succession planning, including succession planning for the chief executive officer.
role of the chief executive officer the personnel committee solicits recommendations from entergy corporation's chief executive officer with respect to compensation decisions for the named executive officers who are members of entergy corporation's office of chief executive. entergy corporation's chief executive officer provides the personnel committee with an assessment of the performance of each of these named executive officers and recommends compensation levels to be awarded to each of them. in addition, the committee may request that the chief executive officer provide management feedback and recommendations on changes in the design of compensation programs, such as special retention plans or changes in the structure of bonus programs. however, the chief executive officer does not play any role with respect to any matter affecting his own compensation, nor does he have any role determining or recommending the amount, or form of, director compensation. the personnel committee also relies on the recommendations of entergy corporation's senior human resources executive management with respect to compensation decisions, policies, and practices.
the chief executive officer may attend meetings of the personnel committee only at the invitation of the chair of the personnel committee and cannot call a meeting of the committee. since he is not a member of the committee, he has no vote on matters submitted to the committee. during 2015, mr. denault attended all of the personnel committee meetings.
role of the compensation consultant entergy corporation's personnel committee has the sole authority for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of its outside compensation consultant. in 2015, entergy corporation's personnel committee retained pay governance llc as its independent compensation consultant to assist it in, among other things, evaluating different compensation programs and developing market data to assess entergy corporation's compensation programs. during
2015, pay governance assisted the committee with its responsibilities related to entergy corporation's compensation programs for its executives. the committee directed pay governance to: (i) regularly attend meetings of the committee; (ii) conduct studies of competitive compensation practices; (iii) identify market surveys and proxy peer
471
table of contents group; (iv) review base salary, annual incentives, and long-term incentive compensation opportunities relative to competitive practices; and (v) develop conclusions and recommendations related to the executive compensation plan for consideration by the committee. a senior consultant from pay governance attended all personnel committee meetings to which he was invited in 2015.
compensation consultant independence to maintain the independence of the personnel committee's compensation consultant, the board has adopted a policy that any consultant (including its affiliates) retained by the board of directors or any committee of the board of directors to provide advice or recommendations on the amount or form of executive or director compensation should not be retained by entergy corporation or any of its affiliates to provide other services in an aggregate amount that exceeds $120,000 in any year. in 2015, pay governance, the personnel committee's independent compensation consultant, did not provide any services to entergy corporation other than its services to the personnel committee and the corporate governance committee. annually, the committee reviews the relationship with its compensation consultant including services provided, quality of those services, and fees associated with services in its evaluation of the executive compensation consultant's independence. the committee also assesses pay governance's independence under nyse rules and has concluded that no conflict of interests exists that would prevent pay governance from independently advising the personnel committee.
tax and accounting considerations section 162(m) of the irs code limits the tax deductibility by a publicly held corporation of compensation in excess of $1 million paid to the chief executive officer or any of its other named executive officers who may be section 162(m) covered employees, unless that compensation is "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of section 162(m). the personnel committee considers deductibility under section 162(m) as it structures the compensation packages that are provided to its named executive officers. likewise, the personnel committee considers financial accounting consequences as it structures the compensation packages that are provided to the named executive officers. however, the personnel committee and the board believe that it is in the best interest of entergy corporation that the personnel committee retains the flexibility and discretion to make compensation awards, whether or not deductible. this flexibility is necessary to foster achievement of performance goals established by the personnel committee, as well as other corporate goals that the committee deems important to entergy corporation's success, such as encouraging employee retention and rewarding achievement of key goals.
personnel committee report the personnel committee report included in the entergy corporation proxy statement is incorporated by reference, but will not be deemed to be "filed" in this annual report on form 10-k. none of the subsidiaries has a compensation committee or other board committee performing equivalent functions. the board of directors of each of the subsidiaries is comprised of individuals who are officers or employees of entergy corporation or one of the subsidiaries. these boards do not make determinations regarding the compensation paid to executive officers of the subsidiaries.

the amounts in column (c) represent the actual base salary paid to the named executive officer.  the 2015
(2)  changes in base salaries noted in the compensation discussion and analysis were effective in april 2015.
the named executive officers are paid on a bi-weekly basis and during 2015 there was an extra pay period at entergy arkansas and entergy mississippi.
(3)  the amounts in column (d) in 2013 for mr. fisackerly, mr. may, mr. mcdonald, ms. rainer, and mr. rice represent a cash bonus paid in recognition of their work supporting the move to miso.
the amounts in column (e) represent the aggregate grant date fair value of restricted stock and performance units granted under the 2011 equity ownership plan and restricted stock units granted under the 2015 equity ownership plan, each calculated in accordance with fasb asc topic 718, without taking into account estimated forfeitures.  the grant date fair value of the restricted stock and the restricted stock units is based on the closing price of entergy corporation common stock on the date of grant.  the grant date fair value of performance units is based on the probable outcome of the applicable performance
(4)  conditions, measured using a monte carlo simulation valuation model.  the simulation model applies a risk-free interest rate and an expected volatility assumption.  the risk-free rate is assumed to equal the yield on a three-year treasury bond on the grant date.  volatility is based on historical volatility for the 36-month period preceding the grant date.  if the highest achievement level is attained, the maximum amounts that will be received with respect to the performance units granted in 2015 are as follows:  mr.
bunting, $1,177,690; mr. denault, $5,951,380; mr. fisackerly, $260,710; mr. marsh, $1,177,690; mr. may,

the amounts in columns (c), (d), and (e) represent minimum, target, and maximum payment levels under the
(1)  annual incentive plan.  the actual amounts awarded are reported in column (g) of the summary compensation table.
the amounts in columns (f), (g), and (h) represent the minimum, target, and maximum payment levels under the long-term performance unit program.  performance under the program is measured by entergy corporation's total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder returns of the companies included
(2)  in the philadelphia utility index.  there is no payout under the program if entergy corporation's total shareholder return falls within the lowest quartile of the peer companies in the philadelphia utility index.  subject to achievement of performance targets, each unit will be converted into one share of entergy corporation's common stock on the last day of the performance period (december 31, 2017.)  accrued dividends on the shares earned will also be paid in entergy corporation common stock.
except as otherwise noted in footnote 6, the amounts in column (i) represent shares of restricted stock
(3)  granted under the 2011 equity ownership plan.  shares of restricted stock vest one-third on each of the first through third anniversaries of the grant, have voting rights, and accrue dividends during the vesting period.
the amounts in column (j) represent options to purchase shares of entergy corporation's common stock.  the
(4)  options vest one-third on each of the first through third anniversaries of the grant date and have a ten-year term from the date of grant. the options were granted under the 2011 equity ownership plan.
(5)  the amounts in column (l) are valued based on the aggregate grant date fair value of the award calculated in accordance with fasb asc topic 718 and, in the case of the performance units, are based on the probable

table of contents outcome of the applicable performance conditions. see notes 4 and 5 to the summary compensation table for a discussion of the relevant assumptions used in calculating the grant date fair value.
(6)  in august 2015, mr. marsh was awarded 21,100 restricted stock units under the 2015 equity ownership plan.

(1)  service under the non-qualified system executive retirement plan is granted from date of hire.  qualified plan benefit service is granted from the later of date of hire or plan participation date.
during 2006, mr. denault entered into an agreement granting him an additional 15 years of service and
(2)  permission to retire under the non-qualified system executive retirement plan in the event his employment is terminated by entergy other than for cause (as defined in the retention agreement), by mr. denault for good

table of contents reason (as defined in the retention agreement), or on account of his death or disability. his retention agreement also provides that if he terminates employment for any other reason, he shall be entitled to the additional 15
years of service under the non-qualified system executive retirement plan if his employer grants him permission to retire. the additional 15 years increases the present value of his benefit by $3,083,700.
qualified retirement benefits defined benefit pension plan the qualified retirement plan in which the named executive officers participate is a funded, tax-qualified, noncontributory defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits to most of the non-bargaining unit employees of entergy system companies. all named executive officers are participants in this plan. benefits under the tax-
qualified pension plan are calculated as an annuity payable at age 65 and generally equal to 1.5% of a participant's final average monthly earnings (fame) multiplied by years of service (not to exceed 40). "earnings"
for purposes of calculating fame generally includes the employee's base salary and eligible annual incentive award and excludes all other bonuses. fame is calculated using the employee's average monthly earnings for the 60
consecutive months in which the employee's earnings were highest during the 120 month period immediately preceding the employee's retirement and includes up to 5 annual bonuses paid during the 60 month period. benefits under the tax-qualified plan are payable monthly after attainment of at least age 55 and after separation from an entergy system company, subject to a reduction for early commencement, as described below. the amount of annual earnings that may be considered in calculating benefits under the tax-qualified pension plan is limited by federal law.
participants are 100% vested in their benefit upon completing 5 years of vesting service or upon attainment of age
65 while an active participant in the plan. contributions to the pension plan are made entirely by the entergy system company employer and are paid into a trust fund from which the benefits of participants will be paid.
normal retirement under the plan is age 65. employees who terminate employment prior to age 55 may receive a reduced deferred vested retirement benefit commencing as early as age 55 that is based on the normal retirement benefit (reduced by 7% per year for the first 5 years commencement precedes age 65, and reduced by 6% for each additional year commencement precedes age 65). employees who are at least age 55 with 10 years of vesting service upon termination of employment are entitled to a subsidized early retirement benefit beginning as early as age 55.
the subsidized early retirement benefit is equal to the normal retirement benefit reduced by 2% per year for each year that early retirement precedes age 65.
mr. denault, mr. bunting, and mr. mcdonald are eligible for subsidized early retirement benefits.
401(k) savings plan the savings plan is a tax-qualified 401(k) retirement savings plan, wherein total combined before-tax and after-tax contributions may not exceed 30% of a participant's base salary up to certain contribution limits defined by law.
in addition, under the savings plan, the employer of savings plan participants, who participate in the final average pay defined benefit pension plan, matches an amount equal to seventy cents for each dollar contributed by participating employees, including the named executive officers, with respect to the first six percent of their eligible earnings under the plan for that pay period.
non-qualified retirement benefits the named executive officers are eligible to participate in certain non-qualified retirement benefit plans that provide retirement income, including the pension equalization plan and the system executive retirement plan. each of these plans is an unfunded non-qualified defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits to key management employees. in these plans, as described below, an executive is typically enrolled in one or more plans but only paid the amount due under the plan that provides the highest benefit. in general, upon disability, participants in the pension equalization plan and the system executive retirement plan remain eligible for continued service credits until the earlier of recovery, separation from service due to disability, or retirement eligibility.
generally, spouses of participants who die before commencement of benefits may be eligible for a portion of the participant's accrued benefit.
484
table of contents all of the named executive officers participate in both the pension equalization plan and the system executive retirement plan.
the pension equalization plan the pension equalization plan is a non-qualified unfunded restoration retirement plan that provides for the payment to participants from entergy corporation's general assets of a single lump sum cash distribution upon separation from service generally equal to the actuarial present value of the difference between the amount that would have been payable as an annuity under the tax-qualified pension plan, but for internal revenue code limitations on pension benefits and earnings that may be considered in calculating tax-qualified pension benefits, and the amount actually payable as an annuity under the tax-qualified pension plan. the pension equalization plan also takes into account as eligible earnings certain incentive awards paid under the annual incentive plan and includes supplemental credited service granted to a participant in calculating his or her benefit. participants receive their pension equalization plan benefit in the form of a single sum cash distribution. the benefits under this plan are offset by benefits payable from the qualified retirement plan and may be offset by prior employer benefits. the pension equalization plan benefit attributable to supplemental credited service is not vested until age 65. subject to the prior written consent of the entergy system company employer (which consent is deemed given if the participant's employment is terminated within twenty-four months following a change in control by the employer without "cause" or by the participant for "good reason," each as defined in the plan), an employee with supplemental credited service who terminates employment prior to age 65 may be vested in his or her benefit, with payment of the lump sum benefit generally at separation from service unless delayed six months under code section
409a. benefits payable prior to age 65 are subject to the same reductions as qualified plan benefits.
effective july 1, 2014, participants in the pension equalization plan are no longer provided with supplemental credited service unless the grant of supplemental credited service was approved and accepted in writing by the plan administrator prior to july 1, 2014. in addition, the pension equalization plan was amended effective july 1, 2014
to provide that employees who participate in the entergy corporation's cash balance pension plan adopted june 30,
2014 are not eligible to participate in the pension equalization plan and instead are eligible to participate in a new cash balance restoration plan.
the system executive retirement plan the system executive retirement plan is a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan that provides for a single sum payment at age 65. like the pension equalization plan, the system executive retirement plan is designed to provide for the payment to participants from entergy corporation's general assets of a single-sum cash distribution upon the participant's separation from service. the single-sum benefit is generally equal to the actuarial present value of a specified percentage of the participant's "final average monthly compensation" (which is generally 1/36th of the sum of the participant's annual rate of base salary and annual incentive plan award for the 3 highest years during the last 10 years preceding termination of employment), after first being reduced by the value of the participant's tax-qualified retirement plan benefit and typically any prior employer pension benefit available to the participant.
while the system executive retirement plan has a replacement ratio schedule from one year of service to the maximum of 30 years of service, the table below offers a sample ratio at 20 and 30 years of service.

table of contents from service unless delayed six months under code section 409a. benefits payable prior to age 65 are subject to the same reductions as qualified plan benefits. further, in the event of a change in control, participants whose employment is terminated without "cause" or by the employee for "good reason," as each is defined in the plan are also eligible for a subsidized lump sum benefit payment, even if they do not currently meet the age or service requirements for early retirement under that plan or have company permission to separate from employment. such lump sum benefit is payable generally at separation from service unless delayed six months under code section 409a.
2015 non-qualified deferred compensation the executive deferred compensation plan, the 2007 equity ownership plan and long-term cash incentive plan, and the
2011 equity ownership plan allow for the deferral of compensation for the named executive officers. as of december
31, 2015, none of the named executive officers had deferred compensation balances under the equity ownership plans or the executive deferred compensation plan.
as of december 31, 2015, mr. may had a deferred account balance under a frozen defined contribution restoration plan. the amount is deemed invested, as chosen by the participant, in certain t. rowe price investment funds that are also available to the participant under the savings plan. mr. may has elected to receive the deferred account balance after he retires. the defined contribution restoration plan, until it was frozen in 2005, credited eligible employees' deferral accounts with employer contributions to the extent contributions under the qualified savings plan in which the employee participated were subject to limitations imposed by the internal revenue code.

2015 potential payments upon termination or change in control entergy corporation has plans and other arrangements that provide compensation to a named executive officer if his or her employment terminates under specified conditions, including following a change in control of entergy corporation. in addition, entergy corporation has entered into a retention agreement with mr. denault that provides for payments upon certain employment termination events. there are no plans or agreements that would provide for payments to any of the named executive officers solely upon a change in control.
the tables below reflect the amount of compensation each of the named executive officers would have received if his or her employment with an entergy system company had been terminated under various scenarios as of december 31,
2015. for purposes of these tables, entergy corporation assumed that its stock price was $68.36, the closing market price on that date.

(2)  also be eligible for certain additional retirement benefits.  otherwise, if mr. denault's employment was terminated for cause or he was to retire from entergy corporation before age 65 without the permission of his entergy system employer, he would not receive a benefit under the system executive retirement plan.
for a description of these benefits, see "2015 pension benefits."
in addition to the payments and benefits in the table, mr. bunting and mr. mcdonald each would have been eligible to retire and entitled to receive his vested pension benefits.  for a description of the pension benefits available, see "2015 pension benefits."  in the event of a termination by entergy corporation without cause or by the executive for good reason in connection with a change in control, mr. bunting and
(3)  mr. mcdonald each would be eligible for subsidized early retirement benefits under the system executive retirement plan even if he does not have permission from his entergy system employer to separate from employment.  if mr. bunting's and mr. mcdonald's employment were terminated for cause or they were to retire from entergy corporation before age 65 without the permission of their entergy system employer, they would not receive a benefit under the system executive retirement plan.

table of contents calculated using early retirement reduction factors. for a description of the pension benefits, see "2015 pension benefits." if a named executive officer's, other than messrs. denault, bunting, and mcdonald, employment were terminated for cause or each were to resign from entergy corporation before age 65 without the permission of his or her entergy system employer, each would not receive a benefit under the system executive retirement plan.
severance payments in the event of a termination (not due to death or disability) by the executive for good reason or by entergy corporation not for cause during the period beginning upon the occurrence of a "potential change in control" (as defined in the system executive continuity plan) and ending on the 2nd anniversary of a change in control, each named executive officer would be entitled to receive pursuant to the system executive continuity plan a lump sum severance payment equal to for messrs. denault, bunting, marsh, and
(5)  west 2.99 times the product of, for mr. may 2 times the product of, and messrs. fisackerly, mcdonald, rice, and ms. rainer the product of 1 time the sum of (a) his or her annual base salary as in effect at any time within one year prior to the commencement of a change in control period or, if higher, immediately prior to a circumstance constituting good reason plus (b) his or her annual incentive, calculated using the average annual target opportunity derived under the annual incentive for 2013 and
2014 (the two calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which his or her termination occurs).  for purposes of this table, we assume the following target opportunity and base salary:

performance units in the event of a termination due to death or disability, by mr. denault for good reason, or by entergy corporation not for cause (in all cases, regardless of whether there is a change in control), mr. denault would have forfeited his performance units for all open performance periods and would have been entitled to receive a single-lump sum calculated using the average annual number of performance units he would have been entitled to receive under the performance unit program with respect to the two most recent
(6)  performance periods preceding the calendar year in which his termination occurs, assuming all performance goals were achieved at target.  for purposes of the table, the value of mr. denault's payment was calculated by taking an average of the target performance units from the 2011-2013 performance unit program (26,000 units) and the 2012-2014 performance unit program (26,900 units).  this average number of units (26,450 units) multiplied by the closing price of entergy corporation stock on december 31, 2015
($68.36) would equal a payment of $1,808,122 for the forfeited performance units.
in the event of a qualifying termination related to a change in control, each named executive officer would have forfeited his or her performance units for the 2014-2016 and 2015-2017 performance periods and would have been entitled to receive, pursuant to the 2011 equity ownership plan, a single-lump sum payment that would not be based on any outstanding performance periods. for both the 2014-2016 and 2015-2017
(7)  performance periods, the payment would have been calculated using the average annual number of performance units he or she would have been entitled to receive under each performance unit program with respect to the two most recent performance periods preceding (but not including) the calendar year in which his or her termination occurs, assuming all performance goals were achieved at target multiplied by the closing price of entergy corporation stock on december 31, 2015.  for purposes of the table, the value of mr.
denault's

table of contents severance payment was calculated by taking an average of the target performance units from the 2011-2013
performance unit program (26,000 units) and the 2012-2014 performance unit program (26,900 units). this average number of units (26,450 units) multiplied by the closing price of entergy corporation stock on december 31, 2015
($68.36) would equal a severance payment of $1,808,122 for the forfeited performance units.
the value of the severance payment for mr. bunting, mr. marsh, and mr. west was calculated by taking an average of the target performance units from the 2011-2013 performance unit program (5,900 units) and the 2012-2014
performance unit program (5,400 units). this average number of units (5,650 units) multiplied by the closing price of entergy corporation stock on december 31, 2015 ($68.36) would equal a severance payment of $386,234 for the forfeited performance units.
the value of the severance payment for mr. may was calculated by taking an average of the target performance units from the 2011-2013 performance unit program (2,500 units) and the 2012-2014 performance unit program (2,400 units).
this average number of units (2,450 units) multiplied by the closing price of entergy corporation stock on december
31, 2015 ($68.36) would equal a severance payment of $167,482 for the forfeited performance units.
the value of the severance payment for mr. fisackerly, mr. mcdonald, ms. rainer, and mr. rice was calculated by taking an average of the target performance units from the 2011-2013 performance unit program (1,200 units) and the
2012-2014 performance unit program (1,500 units). this average number of units (1,350 units) multiplied by the closing price of entergy corporation stock on december 31, 2015 ($68.36) would equal a severance payment of $92,286
for the forfeited performance units.
in the event of death or disability, other than mr. denault, or retirement in the case of mr. denault, mr. bunting, or mr. mcdonald, each named executive officer would not have forfeited his or her performance units for all open performance periods, but rather such performance unit awards would have been pro-rated based on his or her number of months of participation in each open performance unit program performance cycle, in accordance with his or her grant agreement under the performance unit program. the amount of the award is based on actual performance achieved, with a stock price set as of the end of the performance period, and payable in the form of a lump sum after the completion of the performance period. for purposes of the table, the value of the awards was calculated as follows:
mr. denault's:
2014 - 2016 plan - 26,667 (24/36*40,000) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $68.36
2015 - 2017 plan - 11,033 (12/36*33,100) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $68.36
messrs. bunting's, marsh's, and mr. west's:
2014 - 2016 plan - 6,267 (24/36*9,400) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $68.36
2015 - 2017 plan - 2,183 (12/36*6,550) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $68.36
mr. may's:
2014 - 2016 plan - 2,067 (24/36*3,100) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $68.36
2015 - 2017 plan - 683 (12/36*2,050) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $68.36
mr. fisackerly's, mr. mcdonald's, ms. rainer's, and mr. rice's:
2014 - 2016 plan - 1,467 (24/36*2,200) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $68.36
2015 - 2017 plan - 483 (12/36*1,450) performance units at target, assuming a stock price of $68.36
unvested stock options in the event of death or disability or qualifying termination related to a change in control or retirement
(8)  in the case of mr. denault, mr. bunting, or mr. mcdonald, all of the unvested stock options of each named executive officer would immediately vest pursuant to the 2011 equity ownership plan.  in addition, each would be
491
table of contents entitled to exercise his or her stock options for the remainder of the ten-year period extending from the grant date of the options. for purposes of this table, it is assumed that the named executive officers exercised their options immediately upon vesting and received proceeds equal to the difference between the closing price of entergy corporation common stock on december 31, 2015, and the applicable exercise price of each option share.
unvested restricted stock in the event of death or disability (pursuant to the 2011 equity ownership plan), each named executive officer would immediately vest in a pro-rated portion of his or her unvested restricted stock that was otherwise scheduled to become vested on the immediately following twelve (12)-month grant date anniversary date (as well as dividends declared on the pro-rated portion of such restricted stock) pursuant to the
(9)  2011 equity ownership plan.  the pro-rated vested portion would be determined based on the number of days between the most recent preceding twelve (12)-month grant date anniversary date and the date of his or her death or disability. in the event of his or her qualifying termination related to a change in control, the named executive officers would immediately vest in all of their unvested restricted stock (as well as dividends declared on such restricted stock).
welfare benefits upon retirement, mr. denault, mr. bunting, and mr. mcdonald would be eligible for retiree medical and
(10)  dental benefits, the same as all other retirees.  pursuant to the system executive continuity plan, in the event of a termination related to a change in control, messrs. denault, bunting, and mcdonald would not be eligible to receive entergy corporation subsidized cobra benefits.
pursuant to the system executive continuity plan, in the event of a termination related to a change in
(11)  control, mr. marsh, mr. may, and mr. west would be eligible to receive entergy corporation-subsidized cobra benefits for 18 months and mr. fisackerly, ms. rainer, and mr. rice would be eligible to receive entergy corporation-subsidized cobra benefits for 12 months.
restricted stock units mr. marsh's 21,100 restricted stock units vest 100% in 2020.  pursuant to his restricted stock unit agreement, any unvested restricted stock units will vest immediately in the event of his termination of
(12)  employment due to mr. marsh's total disability or death.  in the event of a change in control, the units will vest upon termination of mr. marsh's employment by entergy corporation without cause or by mr. marsh with good reason during a change in control period (as defined in the 2015 equity ownership plan).
otherwise, if mr. marsh voluntarily resigns or is terminated, he would forfeit these units.
mr. west's 21,000 restricted stock units vest 100% in 2018.  pursuant to his restricted stock unit agreement, any unvested restricted stock units will vest immediately in the event of a termination for a
(13)  reason other than cause, total disability or death.  in the event of a change in control, the units will vest upon termination of mr. west's employment by entergy corporation without cause or by mr. west with good reason during a change in control period (as defined in the 2011 equity ownership plan).  if mr.
west voluntarily resigns or is terminated for cause, he would forfeit these units.

•  materially less favorable than those enjoyed by him or her under any of entergy corporation's pension, savings, life insurance, medical, health and accident, disability, or vacation plans at the time of the retention agreement (other than changes similarly affecting all senior executives); or
•  any purported termination of his employment not taken in accordance with his retention agreement.
system executive continuity plan termination related to a change in control the named executive officers will be entitled to the benefits described in the tables above under the system executive continuity plan in the event of a termination related to a change in control if a change in control occurs and their employment is terminated by an entergy system company other than for cause or if they terminate their employment for good reason, in each case within a period beginning on the occurrence of a potential change in control and ending 24 months following the effective date of a change in control.
a change in control includes the following events:
•  the purchase of 30% or more of either entergy corporation common stock or the combined voting power of its voting securities;
•  the merger or consolidation of entergy corporation (unless its board members constitute at least a majority of the board members of the surviving entity);
•  the liquidation, dissolution, or sale of all or substantially all of entergy corporation's assets; or a change in the composition of entergy corporation's board such that, during any two-year period, the individuals serving at the beginning of the period no longer constitute a majority of the board at the end
•  of the period.
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
a potential change in control includes the following events:
•  entergy corporation or an affiliate enters into an agreement the consummation of which would constitute a change in control;
•  entergy corporation board adopts resolutions determining that, for purposes of the system executive continuity plan, a potential change in control has occurred;
•  an entergy system company or other person or entity publicly announces an intention to take actions that would constitute a change in control; or
493
table of contents any person or entity becomes the beneficial owner (directly or indirectly) of outstanding shares of common
•  stock of entergy corporation constituting 20% of the voting power or value of entergy corporation's outstanding common stock.
a named executive officer's employment may be terminated for cause under the system executive continuity plan if he or she:
•  willfully and continuously fails to substantially perform his or her duties after receiving a 30-day written demand for performance from the board;
•  engages in conduct that is materially injurious to entergy corporation or any of its subsidiaries;
•  is convicted or pleads guilty or nolo contendere to a felony or other crime that materially and adversely affects his or her ability to perform his or her duties or entergy corporation's reputation;
•  materially violates any agreement with entergy corporation or any of its subsidiaries; or
•  discloses any of entergy corporation confidential information without authorization.
a named executive officer may terminate his or her employment with an entergy system company for good reason under the system executive continuity plan if, without his or her consent:
•  the nature or status of his or her duties and responsibilities is substantially altered or reduced compared to the period prior to the change in control;
•  his or her salary is reduced by 5% or more;
•  he or she is required to be based outside of the continental united states at somewhere other than his or her primary work location prior to the change in control;
•  any of his or her compensation plans are discontinued without an equitable replacement;
•  his or her benefits or number of vacation days are substantially reduced; or
•  his or her employer purports to terminate his or her employment other than in accordance with the system executive continuity plan.
in addition to participation in the system executive continuity plan, benefits already accrued under the system executive retirement plan, pension equalization plan, and supplemental retirement plan, if any, will become fully vested if the executive is involuntarily terminated without cause or the executive terminates his or her employment for good reason within two years after the occurrence of a change in control. any awards granted under the equity ownership plans will become fully vested if the executive is involuntarily terminated without cause or terminates employment for good reason within two years after the occurrence of a change in control. in 2010, entergy corporation eliminated tax gross up payments for any severance benefits paid under the system executive continuity plan.
under certain circumstances described below, the payments and benefits received by a named executive officer pursuant to the system executive continuity plan may be forfeited and, in certain cases, subject to repayment.
benefits are no longer payable under the system executive continuity plan, and unvested performance units under the performance unit program are subject to forfeiture, if the executive:
•  accepts employment with entergy corporation or any of its subsidiaries;
•  elects to receive the benefits of another severance or separation program;
•  removes, copies, or fails to return any property belonging to entergy corporation or any of its subsidiaries;
•  discloses non-public data or information concerning entergy corporation or any of its subsidiaries; or
494

•  violates his or her non-competition provision, which generally runs for two years but extends to three years if permissible under applicable law.
furthermore, if the executive discloses non-public data or information concerning entergy corporation or any of its subsidiaries or violates his or her non-competition provision, he or she will be required to repay any benefits previously received under the system executive continuity plan.
termination for cause if a named executive officer's employment is terminated for "cause" (as defined in the system executive continuity plan and described above under "termination related to a change in control"), he or she is generally entitled to the same compensation and separation benefits described below under "voluntary resignation," except that all options are no longer exercisable.
voluntary resignation if a named executive officer voluntarily resigns from his or her entergy system company employer, he or she is entitled to all accrued benefits and compensation as of the separation date, including qualified pension benefits
(if any) and other post-employment benefits on terms consistent with those generally available to our other salaried employees. in the case of voluntary resignation, the officer would forfeit all unvested stock options, shares of restricted stock and restricted units as well as any perquisites to which he or she is entitled as an officer. in addition, the officer would forfeit, except as described below, his or her right to receive incentive payments under any outstanding performance periods under the long-term performance unit program or the annual incentive plan. if the officer resigns after the completion of an annual incentive plan or long-term performance unit program performance period, he or she could receive a payout under the long-term performance unit program based on the outcome of the performance cycle and could, at the company's discretion, receive an annual incentive payment under the annual incentive plan. any vested stock options held by the officer as of the separation date will expire the earlier of ten years from date of grant or 90 days from the last day of active employment.
retirement under our retirement plans, a named executive officer's eligibility for retirement benefits is based on a combination of age and years of service. normal retirement is defined as age 65. early retirement is defined under the qualified retirement plan as minimum age 55 with 10 years of service and in the case of the system executive retirement plan and the supplemental credited service under the pension equalization plan, the consent of the entergy system company employer.
upon a named executive officer's retirement, he or she is generally entitled to all accrued benefits and compensation as of the separation date, including qualified pension benefits and other post-employment benefits consistent with those generally available to salaried employees. the annual incentive payment under the annual incentive plan is pro-rated based on the actual number of days employed during the performance year in which the retirement date occurs. similarly, payments under the long-term performance unit program for those retiring with a minimum 12 months of participation are pro-rated based on the actual full months of participation, in each outstanding performance cycle, in which the retirement date occurs. in each case, payments are delivered at the conclusion of each annual or performance cycle, consistent with the timing of payments to active participants in the annual incentive plan and the long-term performance unit program, respectively. unvested stock options issued under our equity ownership plans vest on the retirement date and expire ten years from the grant date of the options. any restricted stock and restricted stock units (other than those issued under the long-term performance unit program) held by the executive upon his or her retirement are forfeited, and perquisites are not available following the separation date.
disability if a named executive officer's employment is terminated due to disability, he or she generally is entitled to the same compensation and separation benefits described above under "retirement," except that restricted stock and restricted stock units may be subject to specific disability benefits (as noted, where applicable, in the tables above).
495
table of contents death if a named executive officer dies while actively employed by an entergy system company employer, he or she generally is entitled to the same compensation and separation benefits described above under "retirement."

table of contents entergy audit committee guidelines for pre-approval of independent auditor services the audit committee has adopted the following guidelines regarding the engagement of entergy's independent auditor to perform services for entergy:
the independent auditor will provide the audit committee, for approval, an annual engagement letter
1.  outlining the scope of services proposed to be performed during the fiscal year, including audit services and other permissible non-audit services (e.g. audit-related services, tax services, and all other services).
for other permissible services not included in the engagement letter, entergy management will submit a description of the proposed service, including a budget estimate, to the audit committee for pre-approval.
2.  management and the independent auditor must agree that the requested service is consistent with the sec's rules on auditor independence prior to submission to the audit committee.  the audit committee, at its discretion, will pre-approve permissible services and has established the following additional guidelines for permissible non-audit services provided by the independent auditor:
•  aggregate non-audit service fees are targeted at fifty percent or less of the approved audit service fee.
•  all other services should only be provided by the independent auditor if it is the only qualified provider of that service or if the audit committee specifically requests the service.
3.  the audit committee will be informed quarterly as to the status of pre-approved services actually provided by the independent auditor.
to ensure prompt handling of unexpected matters, the audit committee delegates to the audit committee chair
4.  or its designee the authority to approve permissible services and fees.  the audit committee chair or designee will report action taken to the audit committee at the next scheduled audit committee meeting.
5.  the vice president and general auditor will be responsible for tracking all independent auditor fees and will report quarterly to the audit committee.

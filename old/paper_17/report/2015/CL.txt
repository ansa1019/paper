item 1a.    risk factors in addition to the risks described elsewhere in this report, set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities.  these risks are not the only ones we face. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. if any of these risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted, which might cause the value of our securities to decline.
we face risks associated with significant international operations, including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.
we operate on a global basis with approximately 75% of our net sales originating in markets outside the u.s. while geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world, it also means that we are subject to the full range of risks associated with significant international operations, including, but not limited to:
▪   changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the u.s. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows from non-u.s. markets or increase our supply costs, as measured in u.s. dollars, in those markets,
▪   exchange controls and other limits on our ability to import raw materials or finished product or to repatriate earnings from overseas,
▪   political or economic instability, social or labor unrest or changing macroeconomic conditions in our markets, including as a result of volatile commodity prices, including the price of oil,
▪   lack of well-established or reliable legal systems in certain countries where we operate,
▪   foreign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources, and
▪   other foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements, including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of onerous trade restrictions, price controls, labor laws, profit controls or other government controls.
these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
4
in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements, we engage in a combination of selling price increases, where permitted, sourcing strategies, cost-containment measures and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions. however, these measures may not succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations.
significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business.
we face vigorous competition worldwide, including from strong local competitors and from other large, multinational companies, some of which may have greater resources than we do. we face this competition in several aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, the pricing of products, promotional activities, new product introductions and expansion into new geographies. such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising. our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to enforce and defend our patent, trademark and trade dress rights against infringement and legal challenges by competitors.
we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully respond to them, which could harm our business. in addition, the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges, including management time, out-of-pocket expenses and price reductions, may affect our performance in the relevant period. a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
our business is subject to legal and regulatory risks in the u.s. and abroad.
our business is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements in the u.s. and abroad. such legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products, including their development, ingredients, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, transportation, distribution, export, import, advertising and sale. u.s. federal authorities, including the u.s. food and drug administration (the "fda"), the federal trade commission, the consumer product safety commission and the environmental protection agency, regulate different aspects of our business, along with parallel authorities at the state and local levels and comparable authorities overseas. also, our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the u.s. and abroad.
new or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements, or more restrictive interpretations of existing requirements, could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  for example, from time to time, various regulatory authorities in europe, the u.s. and other countries request or conduct reviews of the use of various ingredients in consumer products. triclosan, an ingredient used by us primarily in colgate total toothpaste, is an example of an ingredient that has undergone reviews by various regulatory authorities worldwide, and colgate total toothpaste is subject to the fda's rigorous new drug application ("nda") process for safety and efficacy. triclosan is currently being evaluated under the european union's regulation for the registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals (reach), which requires the registration of all covered chemicals used in the european union by 2018. the fda is also evaluating the use of benzalkoniam chloride (an ingredient used in certain of our hand soap products) and triclosan in hand soaps and hand sanitizers. some states and municipalities in the u.s. have proposed, and minnesota has passed, legislation banning the sale of certain products containing triclosan. the minnesota legislation does not cover colgate total toothpaste. environment canada, the federal environmental authority in canada, is also conducting a review to assess human and environmental risks of triclosan and is expected to issue its final assessment in 2016. a decision by a regulatory or governmental authority that triclosan, or any other of our ingredients, should not be used in certain consumer products or should otherwise be newly regulated, could adversely impact our business, as could negative reactions by our consumers, trade customers or non-governmental organizations to our use of such ingredients. additionally, an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients or to obtain regulatory approval of such products on a timely basis could likewise adversely affect our business.
because of our extensive international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (the "fcpa") and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. the fcpa and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. while our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, joint-venture partners or agents. violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
5
while it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, a finding that we are in violation of, or out of compliance with, applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, damages, injunctions or product recalls, or criminal sanctions, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. even if a claim is unsuccessful, is without merit or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products, processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image. for information regarding our legal and regulatory matters, see item 3 "legal proceedings" and note 13, commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements.
increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets, changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business.
our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers and discounters. with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation, we are increasingly dependent on key retailers, and some of these retailers, including large-format retailers, may have greater bargaining strength than we do. they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts, allowances or slotting fees, which could lead to reduced sales or profitability. the loss of a key customer or a significant reduction in sales to a key customer could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. for additional information regarding our customers, see "distribution; raw materials; competition; trademarks and patents" in item 1 "business."
we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products, environmental or sustainability initiatives and other conditions. for example, a determination by a key retailer that any of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. in addition, private label products sold by retail trade chains, which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products, are a source of competition for certain of our product lines, including liquid hand soaps and shower gels. the emergence of new sales channels for our products, such as e-commerce, may affect consumer preferences and market dynamics and could also adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
the growth of our business depends on the successful identification, development and launch of innovative new products.
our growth depends on the continued success of existing products, as well as the successful launch of innovative new products and line extensions. our ability to launch new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully:
▪   identify, develop and fund technological innovations,
▪   obtain and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection and avoid infringing intellectual property rights of others,
▪   obtain approvals and registrations of regulated products, including from the fda and other regulatory bodies in the u.s. and abroad, and
▪   anticipate and respond to consumer needs and preferences.
the identification, development and introduction of innovative new products and line extensions involve considerable costs, and any new product or line extension may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion. our ability to achieve a successful launch of a new product or line extension could also be adversely affected by preemptive actions taken by competitors in response to the launch, such as increased promotional activities and advertising.
the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in us not being the first to market, which could compromise our competitive position and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
6
if, in the course of identifying or developing new products, we are found to have infringed the trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly, through the use of third-party ideas or technologies, such a finding could adversely affect our ability to develop innovative new products and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. even if we are not found to infringe on a third party's intellectual property rights, claims of infringement could adversely affect us, including by increasing costs and by delaying the launch of new products.
we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our 2012 restructuring program.
in the fourth quarter of 2012, we commenced a four-year global growth and efficiency program for sustained growth, which was expanded in 2014 and 2015 (the "2012 restructuring program"). the 2012 restructuring program's initiatives are expected to help us ensure sustained solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales and earnings per share and enhance our global leadership positions in our core businesses. the successful implementation of the remainder of the 2012 restructuring program presents significant organizational challenges and in some cases may require successful negotiations with third parties. as a result, we may not be able to realize all of the remaining anticipated benefits from the 2012 restructuring program. events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all of the remaining anticipated benefits or our not realizing such benefits on our expected timetable. in addition, changes in foreign exchange rates may result in our not achieving the remaining anticipated cost savings as measured in u.s. dollars. if we are unable to realize the remaining anticipated savings of the 2012 restructuring program, our ability to fund other initiatives and enhance profitability may be adversely affected. any failure to implement the 2012 restructuring program in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. for additional information regarding the 2012 restructuring program, refer to part ii, item 7 "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - executive overview and outlook" and "- restructuring and related implementation charges."
there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful.
we develop investments needed to support growth through our continuous, company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization, which we refer to as our funding-the-growth initiatives. these initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics, and advertising and promotional materials, among other things. the achievement of our funding-the-growth targets depends on our ability to successfully identify and realize additional savings opportunities. events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable. if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of our funding-the-growth initiatives, our ability to fund other initiatives and achieve our profitability goals may be adversely affected. any failure to implement our funding-the-growth initiatives in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. for additional information regarding our funding-the-growth initiatives, refer to part ii, item 7 "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - executive overview and outlook."
damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business.
maintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products. accordingly, we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation, such as our ethics and compliance, sustainability, brand protection and product safety, regulatory and quality initiatives.  adverse publicity about us, our brands or our ingredients regarding health concerns, legal or regulatory proceedings, environmental impacts (including packaging, energy and water use and waste management) or other sustainability issues, whether or not deserved, could jeopardize our reputation. in addition, negative posts or comments about us on any social media website, whether true or untrue, could harm our reputation. the success of our brands could also suffer if our marketing initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers.
additionally, due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, distributors, contractors, joint venture partners and other external business partners, for certain functions. while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our reputational and legal risk.
7
in addition, third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products, which are inferior or may pose safety risks. as a result, consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products, which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for these or any other reasons could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation.
volatility in material and other costs could adversely impact our profitability.
raw and packaging material commodities such as resins, pulp, essential oils, tropical oils, tallow, poultry, corn and soybeans are subject to wide price variations. increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy, transportation and other necessary services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along such higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies, such as in manufacturing and distribution.
legal claims and proceedings could adversely impact our business.
from time to time, we may be subject to legal claims and proceedings, including disputes relating to intellectual property, contracts, product liability, marketing, advertising, foreign exchange controls, antitrust and trade regulation, as well as labor and employment, environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions. regardless of their merit, these claims can require significant time and expense to investigate and defend. since litigation is inherently uncertain, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings, or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection therewith, will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters. in addition, if one of our products, or a raw material contained in our products, is perceived or found to be defective or unsafe, we may need to recall some of our products. whether or not a legal claim or proceeding is successful, or a recall is required, such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image. see item 3 "legal proceedings" and note 13, commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on certain of our legal claims and proceedings.
disruption in our global supply chain or key office facilities could adversely impact our business.
we are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale. our operations and those of our suppliers could be disrupted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to:
▪   environmental events,
▪   strikes and other labor disputes,
▪   disruptions in logistics,
▪   loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites,
▪   loss of key suppliers,
▪   supplier capacity constraints,
▪   raw material and product quality or safety issues,
▪   industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues,
▪   the impact on our suppliers of tighter credit or capital markets, and
▪   natural disasters, including climatic events and earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control.
8
in addition, we purchase certain key raw and packaging materials from single-source suppliers or a limited number of suppliers and new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry, governmental and colgate standards, which can require additional investment and take a significant period of time.
while we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate and have business continuity and contingency plans in place for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw and packaging materials, significant disruption of manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied, have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
in addition, as a result of our clustering of single-country subsidiaries into regional commercial hubs and our implementation of a global shared service organizational model, certain of our functions, such as marketing, finance and accounting, and customer service and logistics, have become more concentrated in key office facilities. a significant disruption to any of our key office facilities for any reason, including natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
a cyber-security incident, data breach or a failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact our business or reputation.
we rely extensively on information technology systems ("it systems"), including some which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties and their vendors, in order to conduct our business. our uses of these systems include, but are not limited to:
▪   communicating within the company and with other parties, including our customers and consumers,
▪   ordering and managing materials from suppliers,
▪   converting materials to finished products,
▪   receiving and processing orders from and shipping products to our customers,
▪   marketing products to consumers,
▪   collecting and storing customer, consumer, employee, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data,
▪   processing transactions, including but not limited to employee payroll, employee and retiree benefits and payments to customers,
▪   hosting, processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information,
▪   complying with legal, regulatory and tax requirements,
▪   providing data security, and
▪   handling other processes involved in managing our business.
although we have network security measures in place, our it systems, including those of third-party service providers with whom we have contracted, have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, phishing and other cyber-attacks. we cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns of our, or our third-party service providers', it systems since the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time. in addition, although we have policies and procedures in place to ensure that all personal information collected by the company or its third-party service providers is securely maintained, data breaches due to human error or intentional or unintentional conduct have occurred and likely will continue to occur. although we have seen no material impact on our business operations from the cyber-security attacks and data breaches we have experienced to date, if we suffer a loss or disclosure of confidential business or stakeholder information as a result of a breach of our it systems, including those of third-party service providers with whom we have contracted, we may suffer reputational, competitive and/or business harm, incur significant costs and be subject to government investigations, civil litigation, fines and/or damages, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
9
furthermore, while we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place, if our it systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly for any reason, including the poor performance of, failure of or cyber-attack on third-party service providers, catastrophic events, power outages, cyber-security breaches, network outages, failed upgrades or other similar events and, if the disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct business, as well as reputational harm and litigation, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
uncertain global economic conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business.
uncertain global economic conditions could adversely affect our business. recent global economic trends pose challenges to our business and could result in declining revenues, profitability and cash flows. although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands, during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may switch to economy brands, which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings. additionally, retailers may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lower-priced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and margins.
while we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, a disruption in the credit markets could limit the availability of credit. recent and proposed changes in the bank regulatory environment could reduce the ability of financial institutions to extend credit or increase the cost we are charged to receive credit. reduced access to credit or increased costs could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. in addition, if any financial institutions that hold our cash or other investments or that are parties to our revolving credit facilities supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements, such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments, were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us. this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate, foreign currency or commodity price exposures. in addition, tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers, contract manufacturers or trade customers which could, in turn, adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of senior management.
our success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees. if we are unable to attract and retain talented, highly qualified senior management and other key people, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. in addition, if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management, including our chief executive officer, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected. while we follow a disciplined, ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives, these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time.
we may pursue acquisitions and divestitures, which could adversely impact our results.
we may pursue acquisitions of brands, businesses or technologies from third parties. acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of acquired brands or businesses, the development or launch of products with acquired technologies, the estimation of and assumption of liabilities and contingencies, personnel turnover and the diversion of management's attention from other business priorities, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. in addition, we may be unable to achieve any anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the time frame we anticipate, or at all.
moreover, our pursuit of acquisitions could result in substantial additional debt, exposure to contingent liabilities, such as litigation (including for infringement of intellectual property) or earn-out obligations, the potential impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, or transaction costs, all of which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
we also may periodically divest brands or businesses. these divestitures may adversely impact our results of operations if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested brands or businesses, or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestitures. in addition, businesses under consideration for, or otherwise subject to, divestiture may be adversely impacted prior to the divestiture, which could negatively impact our results of operations.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview and outlook colgate-palmolive company (together with its subsidiaries, the "company" or "colgate") seeks to deliver strong, consistent business results and superior shareholder returns by providing consumers globally with products that make their lives healthier and more enjoyable.
to this end, the company is tightly focused on two product segments: oral, personal and home care; and pet nutrition. within these segments, the company follows a closely defined business strategy to develop and increase market leadership positions in key product categories. these product categories are prioritized based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization's core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable long-term growth.
operationally, the company is organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. the company competes in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to the company's sales and profitability. approximately 75% of the company's net sales are generated from markets outside the u.s., with over 50% of the company's net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of latin america, asia (excluding japan), africa/eurasia and central europe). this geographic diversity and balance help to reduce the company's exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world.
the oral, personal and home care product segment is operated through five reportable operating segments: north america, latin america, europe/south pacific, asia and africa/eurasia, all of which sell to a variety of retail and wholesale customers and distributors. the company, through hill's pet nutrition, also competes on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling its products principally through authorized pet supply retailers and veterinarians.
on an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. these indicators include market share, net sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), gross profit margin, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. the monitoring of these indicators and the company's code of conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls.
to achieve its business and financial objectives, the company focuses the organization on initiatives to drive and fund growth. the company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, through its focus on innovation and the deployment of valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally, which are then rolled out on a global basis. to enhance these efforts, the company has developed key initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental and veterinary professionals and retail customers. growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for the company's products.
the investments needed to support growth are developed through continuous, company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. through these initiatives, which are referred to as the company's funding-the-growth initiatives, the company seeks to become even more effective and efficient throughout its businesses. these initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics, and advertising and promotional materials, among other things, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through sku reductions and formulation simplification. the company also continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses, specifically oral care, personal care and pet nutrition.

(dollars in millions except per share amounts)
as discussed in part i, item 1a "risk factors," with approximately 75% of its net sales generated outside the united states, the company is exposed to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as political uncertainty in some countries, all of which could impact future operating results. for example, as discussed in detail below, the operating environment in venezuela is challenging, with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluations in 2010 and 2013 and effective devaluations in 2014 and 2015, high inflation and a precipitous decline in the price of oil, and governmental restrictions in the form of import authorization controls, currency exchange and payment controls, price and profit controls and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resources. increasingly, the company's venezuelan subsidiary ("cp venezuela") has experienced various production interruptions due to material shortages caused by limited access to u.s. dollars for imported materials, delays in the importation process due to regulations and controls imposed by the venezuelan government, labor unrest and high costs due to inflation coupled with the inability to increase prices without government approval. price controls, which became effective in april 2012, affect the majority of products in cp venezuela's portfolio and restrict the company's ability to implement price increases without government approval, which has limited the company's ability to offset the effects of continuing high inflation and the impact of currency devaluations. in addition, during the first quarter of 2014, the venezuelan government issued the law on fair pricing, establishing a maximum profit margin of 30% for products and services.
cp venezuela's business is reliant on imported materials and products and it cannot maintain regular operations without sufficient access to u.s. dollars which is controlled by the government. in february 2015, the venezuelan government implemented changes in venezuela's foreign exchange regime. while the official exchange rate, as determined by the national center for foreign commerce ("cencoex"), remained at 6.30 bolivares per dollar and the sicad i (supplementary system for the administration of foreign currency) currency market, now known as sicad, was unchanged, the sicad ii market was eliminated and a new, alternative currency market, the foreign exchange marginal system ("simadi"), was created and became operational with a floating exchange rate determined by market participants. cp venezuela has funded its requirements for imported goods through a combination of u.s. dollars obtained from cencoex and intercompany borrowings. although access to u.s. dollars in venezuela has been challenging, because the majority of the products in cp venezuela's portfolio have been designated as "essential" by the venezuelan government, historically cp venezuela's access to u.s. dollars at the official rate of 6.30 bolivares per dollar was generally sufficient to settle most of its u.s. dollar obligations for imported goods. however, cp venezuela's access to u.s. dollars to fund imports became increasingly more limited and sporadic in 2015 and deteriorated even further during the fourth quarter of 2015. although the simadi market has been accessible to cp venezuela, it did not participate in that market through december 31, 2015. since its inception, the volume of transactions in the simadi market as a whole has been very limited, and the simadi exchange rate at december 31, 2015 was 198.70 bolivares per dollar. since the majority of cp venezuela's product portfolio is subject to price controls, it could not operate profitably without substantial price increases approved by the government if it had to pay for imported materials with u.s. dollars obtained from the simadi market.
the company's business in venezuela and the company's ability to repatriate its earnings continue to be negatively affected by these difficult conditions. the restrictive exchange control regulations in venezuela and cp venezuela's increasingly limited access to u.s. dollars have resulted in an 'other-than-temporary' lack of exchangeability between the venezuelan bolivar and the u.s. dollar. this lack of exchangeability, together with other government controls on pricing, payments, profits and imports and restrictive labor laws, have significantly impacted the company's ability to make key operational decisions over its business in venezuela, including the ability to manage its capital structure, material sourcing, product pricing and labor relations. the company expects these conditions will continue for the foreseeable future. as a result, effective december 31, 2015, the company concluded it no longer meets the accounting criteria for consolidation of cp venezuela and began accounting for cp venezuela using the cost method of accounting. as a result, the company recorded an aftertax charge of $1,058 ($1,084 pretax) or $1.16 per diluted share in 2015. the charge primarily consists of an impairment of the company's investment in cp venezuela of $952, which includes intercompany receivables from cp venezuela, and $111 related to the reclassification of cumulative translation losses.
18
(dollars in millions except per share amounts)
effective december 31, 2015, cp venezuela's net assets, which include $75 and $394 of cash and government bonds, respectively, are no longer included in the company's consolidated balance sheet. cp venezuela's net sales, operating profit and net income through december 31, 2015 are included in the company's consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31, 2015. for the year ended december 31, 2015, cp venezuela represented approximately 4% of the company's consolidated net sales and approximately 2% of the company's consolidated operating profit, excluding the impacts of charges related to the change in accounting for the company's venezuelan operations, the 2015 venezuela remeasurements (as defined below), a foreign competition law matter and the 2012 restructuring program and a gain on the sale of the company's laundry detergent business in the south pacific.
in future periods, under the cost method of accounting, the company will no longer include the results of cp venezuela in its consolidated financial statements and will include income relating to its venezuelan operations only to the extent it receives cash for sales of inventory to cp venezuela or for dividends or royalties remitted by cp venezuela. although cp venezuela's local operating results will no longer be included in the company's consolidated financial statements for accounting purposes, under current tax rules, the company is required to continue including cp venezuela in its consolidated u.s. federal income tax return. colgate has been operating in venezuela for 72 years and the company expects its operations in venezuela to continue to provide venezuelan consumers with the company's market leading brands.
prior to the change in accounting for the company's venezuelan operations, which was effective december 31, 2015, the company remeasured the financial statements of cp venezuela at the end of each month at the rate at which it expected to remit future dividends which, based on the advice of legal counsel, was the sicad rate. during the year ended december 31, 2015, the company incurred pretax losses of $34 ($22 aftertax or $0.02 per diluted common share) related to the remeasurement of cp venezuela's local currency-denominated net monetary assets at the quarter-end sicad rate. the quarter-end sicad rate was 12.00 bolivares per dollar, 12.80 bolivares per dollar, 13.50 bolivares per dollar and 13.50 bolivares per dollar as of the end of the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2015, respectively. the remeasurement losses incurred in the second and third quarters of 2015 are referred to as the "2015 venezuela remeasurements."
during the year ended december 31, 2014, the company incurred net pretax losses of $327 ($214 aftertax or $0.23 per diluted common share) related to the remeasurement of cp venezuela's local currency-denominated net monetary assets at the quarter-end sicad i rate for each of the first three quarters of 2014 (the "2014 venezuela remeasurements"). the sicad i rate did not revalue during the fourth quarter of 2014 and remained at 12.00 bolivares per dollar as of december 31, 2014.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, the company incurred a pretax loss of $172 ($111 aftertax or $0.12 per diluted common share) related to the remeasurement of cp venezuela's local currency-denominated net monetary assets at the date of the devaluation that changed the official exchange rate from 4.30 to 6.30 bolivares per dollar (the "2013 venezuela remeasurement"). the 2015 venezuela remeasurements, 2014 venezuela remeasurements and 2013 venezuela remeasurement are referred to together as the "venezuela remeasurements."
included in the remeasurement losses during 2015 and 2014 were charges related to the devaluation-protected bonds issued by the venezuelan government and held by cp venezuela. because the official exchange rate remained at 6.30 bolivares per dollar, the devaluation-protected bonds did not revalue at the sicad rate but remained at the official exchange rate which resulted in an impairment in the fair value of the bonds.

in the fourth quarter of 2012, the company commenced a four-year global growth and efficiency program for sustained growth. the program's initiatives are expected to help the company ensure sustained solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses.
on october 23, 2014, the company's board of directors (the "board") approved an expansion of the global growth and efficiency program (as expanded, the "2012 restructuring program"). the initiatives under the 2012 restructuring program continue to be focused on the following areas:
▪   expanding commercial hubs
▪   extending shared business services and streamlining global functions
▪   optimizing global supply chain and facilities the board authorized the expansion of the 2012 restructuring program to take advantage of additional savings opportunities identified in all three areas.
cumulative pretax charges related to the 2012 restructuring program, once all phases are approved and implemented, are estimated to be $1,285 to $1,435 ($950 to $1,050 aftertax), exclusive of the expansion approved in october 2015 (discussed below). savings from the 2012 restructuring program, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows, are projected to be approximately $405 to $475 pretax ($340 to $390 aftertax) annually by the end of the fourth year of the program, exclusive of the expansion approved in october 2015.
in 2015, 2014 and 2013, the company incurred aftertax costs of $183, $208 and $278, respectively, associated with the 2012 restructuring program.
on october 29, 2015, recognizing the macroeconomic challenges around the world and the company's successful implementation of the 2012 restructuring program to date, the company's board approved the reinvestment of the funds from the sale of the company's laundry detergent business in the south pacific (discussed below) to expand the 2012 restructuring program and extend it for one year through december 31, 2017. initiatives under the expanded 2012 restructuring program will continue to fit within the program's three focus areas of expanding commercial hubs, extending shared business services and streamlining global functions and optimizing the global supply chain and facilities. the company expects the initiatives under the expanded program to have a similar aftertax rate of return to the existing program, which on average has been 30%. the company will update its disclosure to reflect the impact the expansion will have on the range of estimated charges and savings for the 2012 restructuring program when the additional initiatives under the expanded program are approved.
for more information regarding the 2012 restructuring program, see "restructuring and related implementation charges" below.
in august 2015, the company completed the sale of its laundry detergent business in the south pacific to henkel ag & co. kgaa for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 310 australian dollars ($221) and recorded a pretax gain of $187 ($120 aftertax or $0.13 per diluted share) in other (income) expense, net. the gain is net of charges related to the right-sizing of the company's south pacific business, asset write-offs related to the divested laundry detergent business and other costs related to the sale. as discussed above, the funds from the sale will be reinvested to expand the 2012 restructuring program.

on september 13, 2011, the company's mexican subsidiary entered into an agreement to sell to the united states of america (the "purchaser") the mexico city site on which its commercial operations, technology center and soap production facility were located. the parties have subsequently amended the agreement to extend the closing date. under the existing agreement, the final installment of the purchase price is due upon the transfer of the property, which is subject to the company's satisfaction of certain closing conditions relating to site preparation by february 29, 2016. if these conditions are not fully satisfied by such date, the agreement will automatically be extended to march 30, 2016. while these conditions are not expected to be fully satisfied by march 30, 2016, in which case the purchaser has several options under the agreement (including termination and the return to it of the first two installments of the purchase price), based on the discussions to date, the company believes that an additional amendment will be negotiated and the transfer of the property is expected to occur by the third quarter of 2016. the company has reinvested the first two installments to relocate its soap production to a new state-of-the-art facility at its mission hills, mexico site, to relocate its commercial and technology operations within mexico city and to prepare the existing site for transfer. exit costs incurred during the project primarily relate to staff leaving indemnities, accelerated depreciation and demolition to make the site building-ready. in 2015, 2014 and 2013, the company incurred aftertax costs of $0, $3 and $12, respectively, related to the sale of land in mexico.
looking forward, the company expects global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging. while the global marketplace in which the company operates has always been highly competitive, the company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from strong local competitors and from other large multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than the company does. such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion. additionally, the company continues to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations and high raw and packaging material costs, driven by foreign exchange transaction costs. while the company has taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions, should they persist, they could adversely affect the company's future results.
the company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the company's strategic initiatives: engaging to build our brands; innovation for growth; effectiveness and efficiency; and leading to win. this focus, together with the strength of the company's global brands, its broad international presence in both mature and emerging markets and initiatives, such as the 2012 restructuring program, should position the company well to increase shareholder value over the long term.

the charge for a foreign tax matter in 2015 relates to several supreme court rulings in a foreign jurisdiction disallowing certain tax deductions which had the effect of reversing prior decisions. the company had taken deductions in prior years similar to those now disallowed by the court. as a result, as required, the company reassessed its tax position in light of the recent rulings and concluded it needed to increase its unrecognized tax benefits by $15.
the charge of $66 for a foreign tax matter in 2014 relates to a notice of an adverse decision in a foreign court regarding a tax position taken in prior years. as a result, as required, the company reassessed its tax position in light of the decision and concluded it needed to increase its unrecognized tax benefits by $30 and write off a $36 deferred tax asset.
the effective income tax rate in all years benefited from tax planning associated with the company's global business initiatives.

operating profit in europe/south pacific decreased 14% in 2015 to $750, while as a percentage of net sales, it increased 40 bps to 26.1% of net sales. this increase in operating profit as a percentage of net sales was due to a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses (40 bps) as a percentage of net sales. gross profit as a percentage of net sales was even with 2014, as cost savings from the company's funding-the-growth initiatives (240 bps) and the 2012 restructuring program (60 bps) were offset by higher raw and packaging material costs (220 bps), driven by foreign exchange transaction costs, and lower pricing due to increased promotional activities. this decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was due to decreased advertising investment (60 bps), in part reflecting a shift from advertising investment to in-store promotional activities, which was partially offset by higher overhead expenses (20 bps).

restructuring and related implementation charges
2012 restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2012, the company commenced the 2012 restructuring program. the program's initiatives are expected to help colgate ensure sustained solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses.
the 2012 restructuring program is expected to produce significant benefits in the company's long-term business performance. the major objectives of the program include:
▪   becoming even stronger on the ground through the continued evolution and expansion of proven global and regional commercial capabilities, which have already been successfully implemented in a number of the company's operations around the world.
▪   simplifying and standardizing how work gets done by increasing technology-enabled collaboration and taking advantage of global data and analytic capabilities, leading to smarter and faster decisions.
▪   reducing structural costs to continue to increase the company's gross and operating profit.
▪   building on colgate's current position of strength to enhance its leading market share positions worldwide and ensure sustained sales and earnings growth.
on october 23, 2014, the company's board approved an expansion of the 2012 restructuring program. the initiatives under the 2012 restructuring program continue to be focused on the following areas:
▪   expanding commercial hubs - building on the success of this structure already implemented in several divisions, continuing to cluster single-country subsidiaries into more efficient regional hubs, in order to drive smarter and faster decision-making, strengthen capabilities available on the ground and improve cost structure.
▪   extending shared business services and streamlining global functions - implementing the company's shared service organizational model, already successful in europe, in all regions of the world. initially focused on finance and accounting, these shared services will be expanded to additional functional areas to streamline global functions.
▪   optimizing global supply chain and facilities - continuing to optimize manufacturing efficiencies, global warehouse networks and office locations for greater efficiency, lower cost and speed to bring innovation to market.
the board authorized the expansion of the 2012 restructuring program to take advantage of additional savings opportunities identified in all three areas.
on october 29, 2015, the company's board approved the reinvestment of the funds from the sale of the company's laundry detergent business in the south pacific to expand the 2012 restructuring program and extend it for one year through december 31, 2017. initiatives under the expanded 2012 restructuring program will continue to fit within the program's three focus areas of expanding commercial hubs, extending shared business services and streamlining global functions and optimizing the global supply chain and facilities. the company expects the initiatives under the expanded program to have a similar aftertax rate of return to the existing program, which on average has been 30%. the company will update its disclosure to reflect the impact the expansion will have on the range of estimated charges and savings for the 2012 restructuring program when the additional initiatives under the expanded program are approved. the charges and savings discussed below do not reflect the impact of this expansion.

(dollars in millions except per share amounts)
cumulative pretax charges related to the 2012 restructuring program, once all phases are approved and implemented, are estimated to be $1,285 to $1,435 ($950 to $1,050 aftertax). these pretax charges are currently estimated to be comprised of the following categories: employee-related costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (50%); asset-related costs, primarily incremental depreciation and asset impairments (10%); and other charges, which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities (20%) and the implementation of new strategies (20%). over the course of the 2012 restructuring program, it is currently estimated that approximately 75% of the charges will result in cash expenditures. anticipated pretax charges for 2016 are expected to amount to approximately $285 to $435 ($210 to $310 aftertax).
it is expected that the cumulative pretax charges, once all projects are approved and implemented, will relate to initiatives undertaken in north america (15%), europe/south pacific (20%), latin america (5%), asia (5%), africa/eurasia (5%), hill's pet nutrition (10%) and corporate (40%), which includes substantially all of the costs related to the implementation of new strategies, noted above, on a global basis. it is now expected that, by the end of 2016, the 2012 restructuring program will have contributed a net reduction of approximately 2,700-3,200 positions from the company's global employee workforce.
savings from the 2012 restructuring program, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows, are projected to be in the range of $405 to $475 pretax ($340 to $390 aftertax) annually by the fourth year of the program. savings in 2016 are expected to amount to approximately $60 to $70 pretax ($55 to $65 aftertax).

employee-related costs primarily include severance and other termination benefits and are calculated based on long-standing benefit practices, local statutory requirements and, in certain cases, voluntary termination arrangements. employee-related costs also include pension and other retiree benefit enhancements amounting to $17, $5 and $17 for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which are reflected as charges against assets within employee-related costs in the preceding tables, as the corresponding balance sheet amounts are reflected as a reduction of pension assets or an increase in pension and other retiree benefit liabilities (see note 10, retirement plans and other retiree benefits to the consolidated financial statements).
incremental depreciation is recorded to reflect changes in useful lives and estimated residual values for long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. asset impairments are recorded to write down assets held for sale or disposal to their fair value based on amounts expected to be realized. charges against assets within asset impairments are net of cash proceeds pertaining to the sale of certain assets.
other charges consist primarily of charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies as a result of the 2012 restructuring program. these charges for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 included third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of new business and strategic initiatives of $65, $65 and $50, respectively, and contract termination costs and charges resulting directly from exit activities of $8, $40 and $34, respectively, directly related to the 2012 restructuring program. these charges were expensed as incurred. also included in other charges for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are other exit costs of $47, $82 and $25, respectively, related to the consolidation of facilities. other charges for the year ended december 31, 2013 also included a curtailment charge of $91 related to changes to the company's u.s. defined benefit retirement plans (see note 10, retirement plans and other retiree benefits to the consolidated financial statements).
non-gaap financial measures this annual report on form 10-k discusses organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) (non-gaap). management believes this measure provides investors with useful supplemental information regarding the company's underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding the external factor of foreign exchange, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestments. a reconciliation of organic sales growth to net sales growth for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 is provided below.

liquidity and capital resources the company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including for debt service, dividends, capital expenditures, costs related to the 2012 restructuring program and stock repurchases). the company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets.
cash flow net cash provided by operations was $2,949 in 2015, compared to $3,298 in 2014 and $3,204 in 2013. net cash provided by operations for 2015 decreased due to: a decrease in operating profit, excluding a charge related to the change in accounting for the company's venezuelan operations, charges related to the 2012 restructuring program, charges related to the venezuela remeasurements, a gain on the sale of the company's laundry detergent business in the south pacific, costs related to the sale of land in mexico and charges for foreign competition law matters in both periods, as applicable; higher income tax payments; and payments for a foreign competition law matter. the increase in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to strong operating earnings and a continued tight focus on working capital.
the company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). the company's working capital as a percentage of net sales was 0.5% and 0.8% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. this decrease is primarily due to the exclusion of the working capital of the company's venezuelan operations as of december 31, 2015.
on october 29, 2015, the company's board approved the reinvestment of the funds from the sale of the company's laundry detergent business in the south pacific (discussed below) to expand the 2012 restructuring program and extend it through december 31, 2017. the company will update its disclosure to reflect the impact the expansion will have on the range of estimated charges and savings for the 2012 restructuring program when the additional initiatives under the expanded program are approved. the charges and savings discussed below do not reflect the impact of this expansion.
approximately 75% of total program charges related to the 2012 restructuring program, estimated to be $1,285 to $1,435 pretax ($950 to $1,050 aftertax), are expected to result in cash expenditures. savings from the 2012 restructuring program are projected to be in the range of $405 to $475 pretax ($340 to $390 aftertax) annually by the fourth year of the program, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows. the anticipated pretax charges for 2016 are expected to amount to approximately $285 to $435 ($210 to $310 aftertax) and savings in 2016 are expected to amount to approximately $60 to $70 pretax ($55 to $65 aftertax). it is anticipated that cash requirements for the 2012 restructuring program will be funded from operating cash flows. approximately 60% of the restructuring accrual at december 31, 2015 is expected to be paid before year end 2016.
investing activities used $685 of cash in 2015, reflecting a reduction in cash of $75 as cp venezuela's cash is no longer included in the company's consolidated balance sheet effective december 31, 2015, compared to $859 and $890 during 2014 and 2013, respectively. purchases of marketable securities and investments increased in 2015 to $742 from $340 in 2014, partially due to an increase, prior to the change in accounting for the company's venezuelan operations, in cp venezuela's investments in local currency-denominated fixed interest rate government bonds and a fixed interest rate note receivable, an increase in purchases by the company's argentinian subsidiary of u.s. dollar-linked fixed interest rate government bonds and an increase in bank deposits with original maturities greater than 90 days. proceeds from the sale of marketable securities and investments increased in 2015 to $599 from $283 in 2014 partially due to higher proceeds, prior to the change in accounting for the company's venezuelan operations, from cp venezuela's investments in local currency-denominated fixed interest rate government bonds and a fixed interest rate note receivable, higher proceeds from the company's argentinian subsidiary's investment in u.s. dollar-linked fixed interest rate government bonds and an increase in proceeds from the redemption of bank deposits with original maturities greater than 90 days.

in august 2015, the company completed the sale of its laundry detergent business in the south pacific to henkel ag & co. kgaa for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 310 australian dollars ($221) and recorded a pretax gain of $187 ($120 aftertax or $0.13 per diluted share). the gain is net of charges related to the right-sizing of the company's south pacific business, asset write-offs related to the divested laundry detergent business and other costs related to the sale. as discussed above, the funds from the sale will be reinvested to expand the 2012 restructuring program.
in 2011, the company's mexican subsidiary entered into an agreement to sell the mexico city site on which its commercial operations, technology center and soap production facility were located. during 2011 and 2012, the company received the first and second installments of $24 and $36, respectively, related to the sale of land in mexico. the parties have subsequently amended the agreement to extend the closing date. under the existing agreement, the final installment of the purchase price is due upon the transfer of the property, which is subject to the company's satisfaction of certain closing conditions relating to site preparation by february 29, 2016. if these conditions are not fully satisfied by such date, the agreement will automatically be extended to march 30, 2016. while these conditions are not expected to be fully satisfied by march 30, 2016, in which case the purchaser has several options under the agreement (including termination and the return to it of the first two installments of the purchase price), based on the discussions to date, the company believes that an additional amendment will be negotiated and the transfer of the property is expected to occur by the third quarter of 2016.
capital expenditures were $691, $757 and $670 for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the company continues to focus its capital spending on projects that are expected to yield high aftertax returns. capital expenditures for 2016 are expected to be approximately 4.5% of net sales, which is higher than the historical rate of approximately 3.5% primarily due to the 2012 restructuring program.
financing activities used $2,276 of cash during 2015 compared to $2,170 and $2,142 during 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increase in cash used in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to higher principal payments on debt, higher dividends paid and higher purchases of treasury shares, which were partially offset by higher proceeds from the issuances of debt. the increase in cash used in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher principal payments on debt and higher dividends paid, which were partially offset by higher proceeds from the issuances of debt.
long-term debt, including the current portion, increased to $6,567 as of december 31, 2015, as compared to $6,132 as of december 31, 2014 and total debt increased to $6,571 as of december 31, 2015 as compared to $6,148 as of december 31, 2014. the company's debt issuances support its capital structure strategy objectives of funding its business and growth initiatives while minimizing its risk-adjusted cost of capital. during the third quarter of 2015, the company issued $600 of thirty-year notes at a fixed rate of 4.00%. during the second quarter of 2015 the company issued €500 of euro-denominated four-year notes at a variable rate. during the fourth quarter of 2014, the company issued $134 of forty-year notes at a variable rate. during the first quarter of 2014, the company issued $500 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.75% and $500 of ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 3.25%. during the fourth quarter of 2013, the company issued $300 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 1.50% and $82 of forty-year notes at a variable rate. during the second quarter of 2013, the company issued $400 of five-year notes at a fixed rate of 0.90% and $400 of ten-year notes at a fixed rate of 2.10%. the debt issuances during the third quarter of 2015, the first and fourth quarters of 2014 and the second and fourth quarters of 2013 were u.s. dollar-denominated. the debt issuances in 2015, 2014 and 2013 were under the company's shelf registration statement. proceeds from the debt issuances in the second and third quarters of 2015, first quarter of 2014 and second and fourth quarters of 2013 were used for general corporate purposes which included the retirement of commercial paper borrowings. proceeds from the debt issuance in the first quarter of 2014 were also used to repay and retire $250 of u.s. dollar-denominated notes and €250 of euro-denominated notes, both of which became due in the second quarter of 2014. proceeds from the debt issuance in the second quarter of 2013 were also used to repay and retire $250 of notes due in 2013.

at december 31, 2015, the company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $2,976 (including under the facilities discussed below) and could also issue medium-term notes pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. in november 2011, the company entered into a five-year revolving credit facility with a capacity of $1,850 with a syndicate of banks. this facility was extended for an additional year in 2012 and again in 2013. in 2014, the company entered into an amendment of this facility whereby the facility was extended for an additional year to november 2019 and the capacity of the facility was increased to $2,370. the company also has the ability to draw $165 from a revolving credit facility that expires in november 2016. in addition, the company has the ability to draw $20 from a credit facility that expires in december 2016. commitment fees related to the credit facilities are not material.
domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $5 and $255 as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively. the average daily balances outstanding for commercial paper in 2015 and 2014 were $1,989 and $1,486, respectively. the company classifies commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its line of credit that expires in november 2019.
the following is a summary of the company's commercial paper and global short-term borrowings as of december 31, 2015 and 2014:

certain of the facilities with respect to the company's bank borrowings contain financial and other covenants as well as cross-default provisions. noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. the company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. see note 6, long-term debt and credit facilities to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the company's long-term debt and credit facilities.
dividend payments in 2015 were $1,493, an increase from $1,446 in 2014 and $1,382 in 2013. dividend payments increased to $1.50 per share in 2015 from $1.42 per share in 2014 and $1.33 per share in 2013. in the first quarter of 2015, the company's board increased the quarterly common stock cash dividend to $0.38 per share from $0.36 per share, effective in the second quarter of 2015.
the company repurchases shares of its common stock in the open market and in private transactions to maintain its targeted capital structure and to fulfill certain requirements of its compensation and benefit plans. the share repurchase program approved by the board on september 8, 2011 (the "2011 program") authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million shares of the company's common stock. on february 19, 2015, the board authorized the repurchase of shares of the company's common stock having an aggregate purchase price of up to $5,000 under a new share repurchase program (the "2015 program"), which replaced the 2011 program. the company commenced repurchase of shares of the company's common stock under the 2015 program beginning february 19, 2015. the board also has authorized share repurchases on an ongoing basis to fulfill certain requirements of the company's compensation and benefit programs.
aggregate share repurchases in 2015 consisted of 19.9 million common shares under the 2015 program, 1.7 million common shares under the 2011 program and 1.2 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,551. aggregate repurchases in 2014 consisted of 21.7 million common shares under the 2011 program and 1.5 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,530. aggregate repurchases in 2013 consisted of 24.6 million common shares under the 2011 program and 1.0 million common shares to fulfill the requirements of compensation and benefit plans, for a total purchase price of $1,521.

cash and cash equivalents decreased $119 during 2015 to $970 at december 31, 2015, compared to $1,089 at december 31, 2014, most of which ($932 and $1,034, respectively) were held by the company's foreign subsidiaries. the amount at december 31, 2014 included $64 that was subject to currency exchange controls in venezuela, limiting the total amount of cash and cash equivalents held by the company's foreign subsidiaries that could be repatriated at any particular point in time. see note 14, venezuela to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the change in accounting for the company's venezuelan operations effective december 31, 2015. the company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs and, as part of this assessment, the company determines the amount of foreign earnings it intends to repatriate to help fund its domestic cash needs and provides applicable u.s. income and foreign withholding taxes on such earnings.
as of december 31, 2015, the company had approximately $4,600 of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no u.s. income or foreign withholding taxes have been provided as the company does not currently anticipate a need to repatriate these earnings. these earnings have been and currently are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the u.s. and, therefore, are not subject to such taxes. should these earnings be repatriated in the future, they would be subject to applicable u.s. income and foreign withholding taxes. as the company operates in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world and due to the complexities in the tax laws and the assumptions that would have to be made, it is not practicable to determine the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were repatriated.
the following represents the scheduled maturities of the company's contractual obligations as of december 31, 2015:

_______
(1)   includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. interest payments associated with floating rate instruments are based on management's best estimate of projected interest rates for the remaining term of variable rate debt.
(2)   the company had outstanding contractual obligations with suppliers at the end of 2015 for the purchase of raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. these purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms including minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases.
long-term liabilities associated with the company's postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements. the amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements, various economic assumptions (the most significant of which are detailed in "critical accounting policies and use of estimates" below) and voluntary company contributions. based on current information, the company is not required to make a mandatory contribution to its qualified u.s. pension plan in 2016. management also does not expect to make a voluntary contribution to the u.s. pension plans for the year ending december 31, 2016. in addition, total benefit payments to be paid to participants for the year ending december 31, 2016 from the company's assets are estimated to be approximately $63.
additionally, liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities. see note 11, income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
as more fully described in part i, item 3 "legal proceedings" and note 13, commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements, the company has commitments and contingencies with respect to lawsuits, environmental matters, taxes and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.

off-balance sheet arrangements the company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities.
managing foreign currency, interest rate, commodity price and credit risk exposure the company is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. volatility relating to these exposures is managed on a global basis by utilizing a number of techniques, including working capital management, selling price increases, selective borrowings in local currencies and entering into selective derivative instrument transactions, issued with standard features, in accordance with the company's treasury and risk management policies. the company's treasury and risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes and leveraged derivatives for any purpose.
the sensitivity of our financial instruments to market fluctuations is discussed below. see note 2, summary of significant accounting policies and note 7, fair value measurements and financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements.
foreign exchange risk as the company markets its products in over 200 countries and territories, it is exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. the company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of cost-containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements. see the "results of operations" section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on net sales in each operating segment.
the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars at year-end exchange rates with resulting translation gains and losses accumulated in a separate component of shareholders' equity. income and expense items are translated into u.s. dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.
prior to the change in accounting for the company's venezuelan operations, which was effective december 31, 2015, the functional currency for cp venezuela was the u.s. dollar since venezuela was designated as hyper-inflationary, and venezuelan currency fluctuations were reported in income. the local currency-denominated non-monetary assets of the venezuelan operations, including inventories and property, plant and equipment were remeasured at their historical exchange rates, while local currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities were remeasured at period-end exchange rates. remeasurement adjustments for these operations were included in net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company. refer to executive overview and outlook above and to note 14, venezuela to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company's venezuelan operations.
the company primarily utilizes foreign currency contracts, including forward and swap contracts, local currency deposits and local currency borrowings to hedge portions of its exposures relating to foreign currency purchases, assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. the duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market rates.
the company's foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting resulted in net unrealized gains of $35 and $22 at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. at the end of 2015, an unfavorable 10% change in exchange rates would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $39.

(dollars in millions except per share amounts)
interest rate risk the company manages its mix of fixed and floating rate debt against its target with debt issuances and by entering into interest rate swaps in order to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may result from interest rate volatility. the notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the swaps generally match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt, and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates.
based on year-end 2015 variable rate debt levels, a 1% increase in interest rates would have increased interest (income) expense, net by $14 in 2015.
commodity price risk the company is exposed to price volatility related to raw materials used in production, such as resins, pulp, essential oils, tropical oils, tallow, poultry, corn and soybeans. the company manages its raw material exposures through a combination of cost containment measures, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts. futures contracts are used on a limited basis, primarily in the hill's pet nutrition segment, to manage volatility related to anticipated raw material inventory purchases of certain traded commodities.
the company's open commodity derivative contracts, which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, resulted in net unrealized losses of $0 and $1 at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. at the end of 2015, an unfavorable 10% change in commodity futures prices would have resulted in a net unrealized loss of $2.
credit risk the company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the company's policy to contract with diverse, credit-worthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations.
recent accounting pronouncements on january 5, 2016, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2016-01, "financial instruments - overall (subtopic 825-10): recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities." the updated guidance enhances the reporting model for financial instruments, which includes amendments to address aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. the amendment to the standard is effective for the company beginning on june 1, 2018. while the company is currently assessing the impact of the new standard, it does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
on november 20, 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-17 "income taxes (topic 740): balance sheet classification of deferred taxes," which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes. under the new accounting standard, deferred tax assets and liabilities are required to be classified as noncurrent, eliminating the prior requirement to separate deferred tax assets and liabilities into current and noncurrent. the new guidance is effective for the company beginning on january 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. the standard may be adopted prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented. the company is currently assessing the timing of adoption of the new guidance, but does not expect it will have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.
on july 22, 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-11 "inventory (topic 330): simplifying the measurement of inventory," which simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventories by replacing the lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost and net realizable value test. the guidance applies only to inventories for which cost is determined by methods other than last-in first-out ("lifo") and the retail inventory method. the new guidance is effective for the company beginning on january 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.

on april 7, 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-03 "simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs," which requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of related debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. under the former accounting standards, such costs were recorded as an asset. on august 18, 2015, the fasb clarified that the guidance in asu no. 2015-03 does not apply to line-of-credit arrangements. accordingly, companies may continue to present debt issuance costs for line-of-credit arrangements as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred debt costs ratably over the term of the arrangement. the new guidance in asu no. 2015-03 was effective for the company beginning january 1, 2016 and is not expected to have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.
on february 18, 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-02 "consolidation (topic 810): amendments to the consolidation analysis" that amends the current consolidation guidance. the amendments affect both the variable interest entity and voting interest entity consolidation models. the new guidance was effective for the company beginning january 1, 2016 and is not expected to have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.
on may 28, 2014, the fasb and the international accounting standards board ("iasb") issued their final converged standard on revenue recognition. the standard, issued as asu no. 2014-09 "revenue from contracts with customers" by the fasb, provides a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance. the revenue standard contains principles that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. the underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. the new standard also includes enhanced disclosures which are significantly more comprehensive than those in existing revenue standards. asu no. 2014-09 was to be effective for the company beginning january 1, 2017. however, on july 9, 2015, the fasb voted to approve a one-year deferral of the effective date. this new guidance is now expected to be effective for the company beginning january 1, 2018. the standard allows for either "full retrospective" adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or "modified retrospective" adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements. while the company is currently assessing the impact of the new standard, it does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use judgment and make estimates. the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed. actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates. the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management. the company's critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors.
in certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. the company's significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventories.
▪   shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses. the company reports such costs, primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight, in the consolidated statements of income as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. accordingly, the company's gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales. if such costs had been included in cost of sales, gross profit margin would have decreased by 770 bps, from 58.6% to 50.9% in 2015 and decreased by 770 bps and 750 bps in 2014 and 2013, respectively, with no impact on reported earnings.
▪   the company accounts for inventories using both the first-in, first-out ("fifo") method (80% of inventories) and the lifo method (20% of inventories). there would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2015, 2014 or 2013 had all inventories been accounted for under the fifo method.

the areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances, legal and other contingency reserves and, prior to the change in accounting for the company's venezuelan operations, the selection of the exchange rate used to remeasure the financial statements of cp venezuela.
▪   in pension accounting, the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets. the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for u.s. defined benefit plans was 4.93%, 4.24% and 4.96% as of december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other u.s. postretirement plans was 4.97%, 4.36% and 5.24% as of december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. discount rates used for the u.s. and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds whose projected cash flows approximate the projected benefit payments of the plans. the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for u.s. plans was 6.80% as of december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. in determining the long-term rate of return, the company considers the nature of the plans' investments and the historical rate of return.
average annual rates of return for the u.s. plans for the most recent 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year and 25-year periods were (1)%, 7%, 6%, 6% and 8%, respectively. in addition, the current assumed rate of return for the u.s. plans is based upon the nature of the plans' investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 53% in fixed income securities, 27% in equity securities and 20% in real estate and other investments. a 1% change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the u.s. pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company by approximately $10. a 1% change in the discount rate for the u.s. pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company by approximately $3. a third assumption is the long-term rate of compensation increase, a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long-term rate of return. this rate was 3.50% as of december 31, 2015, december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013. refer to note 10, retirement plans and other retiree benefits to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company's pension and other postretirement plans.
▪   the assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate. the company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate. the assumed rate of increase for the u.s. postretirement benefit plans is 6.67% for 2016, declining to 4.75% by 2022 and remaining at 4.75% for the years thereafter. the effect on the total of service and interest cost components of a 1% increase in the assumed long-term medical cost trend rate would decrease net income attributable to colgate-palmolive company by $6.
▪   the company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as stock options and restricted stock units, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant. the company uses the black-scholes-merton ("black-scholes") option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. the weighted-average estimated fair value of each stock option award granted in the year ended december 31, 2015 was $7.25. the black-scholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of stock option awards. these assumptions include the expected term of stock option awards, expected volatility rate, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield. while these assumptions do not require significant judgment, as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent third-party sources, changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in the fair value of stock option awards. a one-year change in expected term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 7%. a 1% change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 6%.

(dollars in millions except per share amounts)
▪   goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, such as the company's global brands, are subject to impairment tests at least annually. the company performs either a quantitative or qualitative assessment to determine the fair value of its reporting units for goodwill and fair value of its indefinite life intangible assets. the asset impairment analysis performed for both goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets requires several estimates, including future cash flows consistent with management's strategic plans, sales growth rates, foreign exchange rates and the selection of a discount rate. qualitative factors, in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above, include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions, industry-specific considerations and historical financial performance.
the estimated fair value of the company's intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value, except for the intangible assets acquired in the sanex acquisition in 2011, which were recorded at fair value. the estimated fair value of the company's reporting units also substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value. therefore, it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets. asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2012 restructuring program requires management's best estimate of net realizable values.
▪   the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolution.
▪   tax valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets, such as tax loss carryforwards, to net realizable value. factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction, carryforward periods, income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income.
▪   legal and other contingency reserves are based on management's assessment of the risk of potential loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisors. such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances, if necessary. while it is possible that the company's cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies, it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material impact on the company's financial position, or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows. refer to note 13, commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company's contingencies.
▪   prior to the change in accounting for the company's venezuelan operations, the selection of the exchange rate used to remeasure the financial statements of cp venezuela required careful consideration by management given the various currency exchange mechanisms that exist in venezuela. although access to u.s. dollars in venezuela has been challenging, because the majority of the products in cp venezuela's portfolio have been designated as "essential" by the venezuelan government, historically cp venezuela's access to u.s. dollars at the official rate of 6.30 bolivares per dollar was generally sufficient to settle most of its u.s. dollar obligations for imported materials. however, the company did not believe this rate was applicable to foreign investments and could not be used to pay dividends. the company also gave consideration to using the simadi rate to remeasure the financial statements of cp venezuela; however, cp venezuela did not participate in the simadi market through december 31, 2015 and had no intention to do so. as a result, the company remeasured the financial statements of cp venezuela at the rate at which it believed was applicable for the remittance of future dividends which, based on the advice of legal counsel, was the sicad rate.

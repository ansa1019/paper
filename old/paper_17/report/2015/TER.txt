item 1a:   risk factors

risks associated with our business the risks described below are not the only risks that we face. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
our business is impacted by global and industry-specific economic cycles, which are difficult to predict, and actions we have taken or may take to offset these cycles may not be sufficient.
capital equipment providers in the electronics and semiconductor industries, such as teradyne, have, in the past, been negatively impacted by both sudden slowdowns in the global economies and recurring cyclicality within those industries. these cycles have resulted in periods of over-supply; a trend we believe will continue to
9
occur for newer generations of electronic products. our business and results of operations depend, in significant part, upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics, which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products. disruption or deterioration in economic conditions may reduce customer purchases of our products, thereby reducing our revenues and earnings. in addition, such adverse changes in economic conditions, and resulting slowdowns in the market for our products, may, among other things, result in increased price competition for our products, increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories, increased risk in the collectability of our accounts receivable from our customers, potential reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable, increased risk of restructuring charges, and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues, which, in each case and together, adversely affect our operating results. we are unable to predict the likely duration, frequency and severity of disruptions in financial markets, credit availability, and adverse economic conditions throughout the world, and we cannot ensure that the level of revenues or new orders for a fiscal quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters. we have taken actions to address the effects of general economic variability and recurring industry cyclicality, including implementing cost control and reduction measures. if our businesses experience further downturns, whether due to a deterioration in global economic conditions or slowdowns in specific markets we serve, we may need to take further cost control and reduction measures. we cannot predict whether these measures will be sufficient to offset global or market-specific disruptions that might affect our test businesses.
we are subject to intense competition.
we face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments. some of our competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products. we also face competition from emerging asian equipment companies and internal development at several of our customers. some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer. we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics. new product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of our products.
the market for our products is concentrated, and our business depends, in part, on obtaining orders from a few significant customers.
the market for our products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment. in each of the years 2015, 2014 and 2013, our three largest customers in aggregate accounted for 25%, 21% and 26% of consolidated revenues, respectively. in any one reporting period, a single customer or several customers may contribute even a larger percentage of our consolidated revenues. in addition, our ability to increase sales will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain orders from current or new significant customers. the opportunities to obtain orders from these customers may be limited, which may impair our ability to grow revenues. we expect that sales of our products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future. the loss of a significant customer or any reduction in orders by these customers, including reductions due to market or competitive conditions, would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
failure to realize the estimated sales value of equipment leased to our customers may adversely affect our results of operations.
we occasionally lease equipment to our customers, typically for a term of one year. the cost of the leased equipment is recorded as an asset on our balance sheet and depreciated over an estimated useful life of approximately four years. realization of the leased equipments value depends on numerous factors including: the technological obsolescence of the leased equipment; elections by customers to terminate a lease prior to
10
scheduled termination; the general market conditions at the time of expiration of the lease; the customers election to renew the lease; and the cost of comparable new equipment. our inability to realize the value of leased equipment could cause a decrease in revenues and an increase in asset write-offs which would in each case reduce our operating income.
our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly.
our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues or profitability. the following factors could impact future operations:
   a worldwide economic slowdown or disruption in the global financial markets;

   competitive pressures on selling prices;

   our ability to introduce, and the market acceptance of, new products;

   changes in product revenues mix resulting from changes in customer demand;

                       the level of orders received which can be shipped in a quarter because of the tendency of customers to wait until late in a quarter to commit to purchase due to capital expenditure approvals and constraints occurring at the end of a quarter, or the hope of obtaining more favorable pricing from a competitor seeking the business;

   engineering and development investments relating to new product introductions, and the expansion of manufacturing, outsourcing and engineering operations in asia;

   provisions for excess and obsolete inventory relating to the lack of demand for and the discontinuance of products;

   impairment charges for certain long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill;

   an increase in the leasing of our products to customers;

   our ability to expand our global distribution channel for our collaborative robots;

   parallel or multi-site testing could lead to a decrease in the ultimate size of the market for our products; and

   the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to meet product quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products, especially if product demand increases.

as a result of the foregoing and other factors, we have experienced and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or stock price.
we are subject to risks of operating internationally.
a significant portion of our total revenues is derived from customers outside the united states. our international sales and operations are subject to significant risks and difficulties, including:
   unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements affecting international markets;

   changes in tariffs and exchange rates;

   social, political and economic instability, acts of terrorism and international conflicts;

   difficulties in protecting intellectual property;

   difficulties in accounts receivable collection;

   cultural differences in the conduct of business;

11
   difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;

   compliance with customs regulations; and

   compliance with international tax laws and regulations.

in addition, an increasing portion of our products and the products we purchase from our suppliers are sourced or manufactured in foreign locations, including china, and a large portion of the devices our products test are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcontractors in taiwan, china, singapore and other parts of asia. as a result, we are subject to a number of economic and other risks, particularly during times of political or financial instability in these regions. disruption of manufacturing or supply sources in these international locations could materially adversely impact our ability to fill customer orders and potentially result in lost business.
if we fail to develop new technologies to adapt to our customers needs and if our customers fail to accept our new products, our revenues will be adversely affected.
we believe that our technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineers. in a rapidly evolving market, such as ours, the development or acquisition of new technologies, commercialization of those technologies into products and market acceptance and customer demand for those products are critical to our success. successful product development or acquisition, introduction and acceptance depend upon a number of factors, including:
   new product selection;

   ability to meet customer requirements;

   development of competitive products by competitors;

   timely and efficient completion of product design;

   timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and manufacturing processes;

   timely remediation of product performance issues, if any, identified during testing;

   assembly processes and product performance at customer locations;

   differentiation of our products from our competitors products;

   management of customer expectations concerning product capabilities and product life cycles;

   ability to attract and retain technical talent; and

   innovation that does not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties.

if our suppliers do not meet product or delivery requirements, we could have reduced revenues and earnings.
certain components, including semiconductor chips, may be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements. approximately 25% of material purchases require some custom work where having multiple suppliers would be cost prohibitive. if any of our suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products, we could lose time-sensitive customer orders, have significantly decreased revenues and earnings and be subject to contractual penalties, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, we rely on contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in our products, and our ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors, over whom we do not exercise any control.
to a certain extent, we are dependent upon the ability of our suppliers and contractors to help meet increased product or delivery requirements. it may be difficult for certain suppliers to meet delivery requirements in a period of rapid growth, therefore impacting our ability to meet our customers demands.
12
we rely on the financial strength of our suppliers. there can be no assurance that the loss of suppliers either as a result of financial viability, bankruptcy or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
our operations may be adversely impacted if our outsourced contract manufacturers or service providers fail to perform.
we depend on flextronics international ltd. (flextronics) to manufacture and test our flex and j750 family of products from its facility in china and on other contract manufacturers to manufacture other products. if for any reason these contract manufacturers cannot provide us with these products in a timely fashion, or at all, we may not be able to sell these products to our customers until we enter a similar arrangement with an alternative contract manufacturer. if we experience a problem with our supply of products from flextronics or our other contract manufacturers, it may take us significant time to either manufacture the product or find an alternate contract manufacturer, which could result in substantial expense and disruption to our business.
we have also outsourced a number of our general and administrative functions, including information technology, to reputable service providers, many of which are in foreign countries, sometimes impacting communication with them because of language and time differences. their presence in foreign countries also increases the risk they could be exposed to political risk. additionally, there may be difficulties encountered in coordinating the outsourced operations with existing functions and operations. if we fail in successfully coordinating and managing the outsourced service providers, it may cause an adverse effect on our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
we may not fully realize the benefits of our acquisitions or strategic alliances.
in june 2015, we acquired universal robots. we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring universal robots or successfully grow universal robots business. we may continue to acquire additional businesses, form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses. we may not be able to realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration with our existing operations of other businesses or technologies that we may acquire. in addition, the integration process for our acquisitions may be complex, costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities. we may have difficulty in developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a manner that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines and allows us to realize value from expected synergies. following an acquisition, we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition. acquisitions may also result in one-time charges (such as acquisition-related expenses, write-offs or restructuring charges) or in the future, impairment of goodwill, that adversely affect our operating results. additionally, we may fund acquisitions of new businesses, strategic alliances or joint ventures by utilizing our cash, incurring debt, issuing shares of our common stock, or by other means.
in the fourth quarter of 2014, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $98.9 million in our wireless test segment as a result of decreased projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market due to reuse of wireless test equipment, price competition and different testing techniques. further reductions in the size of the wireless test market may occur, which may result in additional goodwill impairment charges, increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories, asset write-offs and restructuring charges.
we may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with environmental regulations.
we are subject to both domestic and international environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use, storage, discharge, site cleanup and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes. if we fail to comply with present and future regulations, or are required to perform site
13
remediation, we could be subject to future liabilities or cost, including penalties or the suspension of production. present and future regulations may also:
   restrict our ability to expand facilities;

   restrict our ability to ship certain products;

   require us to modify our operations logistics;

   require us to acquire costly equipment; or

   require us to incur other significant costs and expenses.

pursuant to present regulations and agreements, we are conducting groundwater and subsurface assessment and monitoring and are implementing remediation and corrective action plans for facilities located in massachusetts and new hampshire which are no longer conducting manufacturing operations. as of december 31, 2015, we have not incurred material costs as result of the monitoring and remediation steps taken at the massachusetts and new hampshire sites.
on january 27, 2003, the european union adopted the following directives: (i) the directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (the rohs directive); and (ii) the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment (the weee directive). the weee directive became effective august 13, 2005 and the rohs directive became effective on july 6, 2006. both the rohs directive and the weee directive alter the form and manner in which electronic equipment is imported, sold and handled in the european union. other jurisdictions, such as china, have followed the european unions lead in enacting legislation with respect to hazardous substances and waste removal. ensuring compliance with the rohs directive, the weee directive and similar legislation in other jurisdictions, and integrating compliance activities with our suppliers and customers could result in additional costs and disruption to operations and logistics and thus, could have a negative impact on our business, operations or financial condition.
we currently are, and in the future may be, subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings that could have an adverse effect on our business.
from time to time, we may be subject to litigation or other administrative, regulatory or governmental proceedings, including tax audits and resulting claims that could require significant management time and resources and cause us to incur expenses and, in the event of an adverse decision, pay damages or incur costs in an amount that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation costs, licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products.
we have been sued for patent infringement in the past and receive notifications from time to time that we may be in violation of patents held by others. an assertion of patent infringement against us, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products or it could force us to seek a license to the intellectual property rights of others or alter such products so that they no longer infringe the intellectual property rights of others. a license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all. similarly, changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical. additionally, patent litigation could require a significant use of management resources and involve a lengthy and expensive defense, even if we eventually prevail. if we do not prevail, we might be forced to pay significant damages, obtain licenses, modify our products, or stop making our products; each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results or cash flows.
14
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property (ip), we may lose a valuable asset or may incur costly litigation to protect our rights.
we protect the technology that is incorporated in our products in several ways, including through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection and by contractual agreement. however, even with these protections, our ip may still be challenged, invalidated or subject to other infringement actions. while we believe that our ip has value in the aggregate, no single element of our ip is in itself essential. if a significant portion of our ip is invalidated or ineffective, our business could be materially adversely affected.
we may incur higher tax rates than we expect and may have exposure to additional international tax liabilities and costs.
we are subject to paying income taxes in the united states and various other countries where we operate. our effective tax rate is dependent on where our earnings are generated and the tax regulations and the interpretation and judgment of administrative tax or revenue entities in the united states and other countries. we have pursued a global tax strategy which could adversely be affected by the mix of earnings and tax rates in the countries where we operate, changes to tax laws or an adverse tax ruling by administrative entities. we are also subject to tax audits in the countries where we operate. any material assessment resulting from an audit from an administrative tax or revenue entity could also negatively affect our financial results.
as a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions. in certain foreign jurisdictions, we qualify for tax incentives and tax holidays based on our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various tests relating to our employment levels, research and development expenditures and other qualification requirements in a particular foreign jurisdiction. while we intend to operate in such a manner to maintain and maximize our tax incentives, no assurance can be given that we have so qualified or that we will so qualify for any particular year or jurisdiction. if we fail to qualify and to remain qualified for certain foreign tax incentives and tax holidays, we may be subject to further taxation or an increase in our effective tax rate which would adversely impact our financial results. in december 2015, teradyne entered into an agreement with the singapore economic development board which extended our singapore tax holiday under substantially similar terms to the agreement which expired on december 31, 2015. the new tax holiday is scheduled to expire on december 31, 2020. the tax savings attributable to the singapore tax holiday for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $11.5 million or $0.05 per diluted share, $13.2 million or $0.06 per diluted share and $4.7 million or $0.02 per diluted share, respectively.
in addition, we may incur additional costs, including headcount expenses, in order to maintain or obtain a foreign tax incentive in a particular foreign jurisdiction.
we have significant guarantees, indemnification and customer confidentiality obligations.
from time to time, we make guarantees to customers regarding the delivery, price and performance of our products and guarantee certain indebtedness, performance obligations or lease commitments of our subsidiary and affiliate companies. we also have agreed to provide indemnification to our officers, directors, employees and agents, to the extent permitted by law, arising from certain events or occurrences while the officer, director, employee or agent, is or was serving at our request in such capacity. additionally, we have confidentiality obligations to certain customers and if breached would require the payment of significant penalties. if we become liable under any of these obligations, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. for additional information see note j: commitments and contingenciesguarantees and indemnification obligations in notes to consolidated financial statements.
we may discontinue or reduce our quarterly cash dividend or share repurchase program.
in january 2014, our board of directors initiated a quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share. in january 2015, our board of directors authorized teradyne to repurchase up to $500 million of common stock. in 2015, we
15
repurchased $300 million of common stock. in 2016, we intend to repurchase between $100 million and $200 million of common stock. holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive dividends when and if they are declared by our board of directors. future cash dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend, among other things, upon our earnings, capital requirements and financial condition. while we have declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock and authorized a share repurchase program, we are not required to do either and may reduce or eliminate our cash dividend or share repurchase program in the future. the reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or our share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
we may incur indebtedness.
on april 27, 2015, we entered into a five-year, senior secured revolving credit facility of up to $350 million. subject to customary conditions, we may seek to obtain from existing or new lenders incremental commitments under the credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $150 million. we have not borrowed any funds under this credit facility. we could borrow funds under this credit facility at any time for general corporate purposes and working capital. incurring indebtedness, among other things, could:
   make it difficult to pay other obligations;

   make it difficult to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes;

   require the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures; and

   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we compete.

restrictive covenants in the agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facility may restrict our ability to pursue business strategies.
the agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facility limits our ability, among other things, to: incur additional secured indebtedness; sell, transfer, license or dispose of assets; consolidate or merge; enter into transactions with our affiliates; and incur liens. in addition, our senior secured revolving credit facility contains financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interest, such as, subject to permitted exceptions, making capital expenditures in excess of certain thresholds, making investments, loans and other advances, and prepaying any additional indebtedness while our indebtedness under our senior secured revolving credit facility is outstanding. our failure to comply with financial and other restrictive covenants could result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, could result in the lenders requiring immediate payment of all outstanding borrowings or foreclosing on collateral pledged to them to secure the indebtedness.
our business may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees.
competition for employees with skills we require is intense in the high technology industry. our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain key technical employees. the loss of one or more key or other employees, a decrease in our ability to attract additional qualified employees, or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
new regulations related to conflict minerals may adversely affect us.
the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act imposes new disclosure requirements regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries
16
in our products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. this requirement could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of components we use in our products. in addition, there are additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. our supply chain is complex and we may be unable to verify the origins for all minerals used in our products. as a result, we may be unable to certify that our products are conflict free.
our operations, and the operations of our customers and suppliers, are subject to risks of natural catastrophic events, widespread health epidemics, acts of war, terrorist attacks and the threat of domestic and international terrorist attacks, any one of which could result in cancellation of orders, delays in deliveries or other business activities, or loss of customers and could negatively affect our business and results of operations.
our business is international in nature, with our sales, service and administrative personnel and our customers and suppliers located in numerous countries throughout the world. our operations, and those of our customers and suppliers, are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, health epidemics, fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, energy shortages, telecommunication failures, tsunamis, flooding or other natural disasters. such disruption could materially increase our costs and expenses as well as cause delays in, among other things, shipments of products to our customers, our ability to perform services requested by our customers, or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites. any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations.
a breach of our operational or security systems could negatively affect our business and results of operations.
we rely on various information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, including confidential data, and to carry out and support a variety of business activities, including manufacturing, research and development, supply chain management, sales and accounting. a failure in or a breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our suppliers and other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of proprietary or confidential information, damage our reputation, cause losses and increase our costs.
we may face risks associated with shareholder activism.
publicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by shareholders advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases or divestitures. we may become subject in the future to such shareholder activity and demands. such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our business plans, be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, divert the attention of management or result in our initiating borrowing or increasing our share repurchase plan or dividend, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business or stock price.
provisions of our charter and by-laws and massachusetts law make a takeover of teradyne more difficult.
there are provisions in our basic corporate documents and under massachusetts law that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control, even if a change in control may be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders.
item 7:   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

overview we are a leading global supplier of automation equipment for test and industrial applications. we design, develop, manufacture and sell automatic test systems used to test semiconductors, wireless products, data storage and complex electronics systems in the consumer electronics, wireless, automotive, industrial, computing, communications, and aerospace and defense industries. our industrial automation products include collaborative robots used by global manufacturing and light industrial customers to improve quality, increase manufacturing efficiency and decrease manufacturing costs. our automatic test equipment and industrial automation products and services include:
   semiconductor test (semiconductor test) systems;

   defense/aerospace (defense/aerospace) test instrumentation and systems, storage test (storage test) systems, and circuit-board test and inspection (production board test) systems (collectively these products represent system test);

   wireless test (wireless test) systems; and

   industrial automation (industrial automation) products.

we have a broad customer base which includes integrated device manufacturers (idms), outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers (osats), wafer foundries, fabless companies that design, but contract with others for the manufacture of integrated circuits (ics), developers of wireless devices and consumer electronics, manufacturers of circuit boards, automotive suppliers, wireless product manufacturers, storage device manufacturers, aerospace and military contractors, and distributors that sell collaborative robots.
on june 11, 2015, we acquired universal robots a/s (universal robots) for approximately $284 million of cash plus up to an additional $65 million of cash if certain performance targets are met extending through 2018. universal robots is the leading supplier of collaborative robots which are low-cost, easy-to-deploy and simple-to-program robots that work side by side with production workers to improve quality, increase manufacturing efficiency and decrease manufacturing costs. universal robots is a separate operating and reportable segment, industrial automation. the acquisition of universal robots provides a growth engine to our business and complements our existing system test and wireless test segments. the total purchase price for universal robots was approximately $315 million.
in 2014, we acquired avionics interface technologies, llc (ait), a supplier of equipment for testing state-of-the-art data communication buses. the acquisition of ait complements our defense/aerospace line of bus test instrumentation for commercial and defense avionics systems. ait is included in our system test
21
segment. the total purchase price for ait was approximately $21 million, which included cash paid of approximately $19 million and $2 million in fair value of contingent consideration payable upon achievement of revenue and gross margin targets in 2015 and 2016. no contingent consideration was paid for 2015. the maximum remaining contingent consideration that could be paid is $1.1 million.
in 2013, we acquired ztec instruments inc. (ztec), a supplier of modular wireless test instruments. the acquisition of ztec expands our wireless test segment into the design verification test of wireless components and chipsets. the total purchase price for ztec was approximately $17 million, which included cash paid of approximately $15 million and $2 million in fair value of contingent consideration payable upon achievement of certain customer order and revenue targets through 2015. none of the contingent consideration was paid.
we believe our recent acquisitions have enhanced our opportunities for growth. we will continue to invest in our business, grow market share in our markets and expand further our addressable markets while tightly managing our costs.
the sales of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers who are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products. these cyclical periods have had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on our business since our customers often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and to demand fluctuations in the semiconductor and electronics industries. historically, these demand fluctuations have resulted in significant variations in our results of operations. the sharp swings in the semiconductor and electronics industries in recent years have generally affected the semiconductor and electronics test equipment and services industries more significantly than the overall capital equipment sector.
in the fourth quarter of 2014, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $98.9 million in our wireless test segment as a result of decreased projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market due to reuse of wireless test equipment, price competition and different testing techniques. further reductions in the size of the wireless test market may occur, which may result in additional goodwill impairment charges, increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories, asset write-offs and restructuring charges.
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition. the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results.
revenue recognition we recognize revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, title and risk of loss have passed, delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. title and risk of loss generally pass to our customers upon shipment or at delivery destination point. in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination, acceptance or cash payment, we defer revenue recognition until such events occur except when title transfer is tied to cash payment outside the united states. outside the united states, we recognize revenue upon shipment or at delivery destination point, even if we retain a form of title to products delivered to customers, provided the sole purpose is to enable us to recover the products in the event of customer payment default and the arrangement does not prohibit the customers use or resale of the product in the ordinary course of business.
our equipment has non-software and embedded software components that function together to deliver the equipments essential functionality. revenue is recognized upon shipment or at delivery destination point, provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment. certain contracts require us to
22
perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications, which are generally conducted prior to shipment. where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment, revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received. we also defer the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance, which represents deferred profit.
for multiple element arrangements, we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. in such circumstances, a hierarchy is used to determine the selling price for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (vsoe), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (tpe), and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (besp). for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit, the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in our control.
our post-shipment obligations include installation, training services, one-year standard warranties, and extended warranties. installation does not alter the product capabilities, does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors. installation is typically provided within five days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter. training services are optional and do not affect the customers ability to use the product. we defer revenue for the selling price of installation and training. extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and we defer revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board (fasb) accounting standards codification (asc) 605-20, separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts and asc 605-25, revenue recognition multiple-element arrangements. service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as services are performed.
our products are generally subject to warranty and the related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenues when product revenue is recognized. we classify shipping and handling costs in cost of revenues.
we do not provide our customers with contractual rights of return for any of our products.
translation of non-u.s. currencies the functional currency for all non-u.s. subsidiaries is the u.s. dollar, except for the industrial automation segment for which the local currency is its functional currency. all foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured on a monthly basis into the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. all foreign currency denominated non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into the functional currency using historical exchange rates. net foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are included in other (income) expense, net. for industrial automation, assets and liabilities are translated into u.s. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. revenue and expense amounts are translated using an average of exchange rates in effect during the period. translation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
retirement and postretirement plans we recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of the plan assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans. we calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets. actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of december 31 and, accordingly, recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans.
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. on a quarterly basis, we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventories for net realizable value. we record a provision
23
for both excess and obsolete inventory when such write-downs or write-offs are identified through the quarterly review process. the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand, product mix, and possible alternative uses.
equity incentive and stock purchase plans stock-based compensation expense is based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc 718, compensationstock compensation. as required by asc 718, we have made an estimate of expected forfeitures and are recognizing compensation costs only for those stock-based compensation awards expected to vest.
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. we performed the required assessment of positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of the net deferred tax assets in accordance with asc 740, accounting for income taxes. this assessment included the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, estimates of projected future taxable income and tax-planning strategies. although realization is not assured, based on our assessment, we concluded that it is more likely than not that such assets, net of the existing valuation allowance, will be realized. u.s. income taxes are not provided for on the earnings of non-u.s. subsidiaries which are expected to be reinvested indefinitely in operations outside the u.s. for intra-period tax allocations, we first utilize non-equity related tax attributes, such as net operating losses and credit carryforwards, and then equity-related tax attributes. we use the with-and-without method for calculating excess stock compensation deductions and do not take into account any indirect impacts of excess stock compensation deductions on its research and development tax credits, domestic production activities deduction, and other differences between financial reporting and tax reporting.
investments we account for our investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with the provisions of asc 320-10, investmentsdebt and equity securities. on a quarterly basis, we review our investments to identify and evaluate those that have an indication of a potential other-than-temporary impairment. factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include:
   the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost;

   the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and

   the intent and ability to retain the investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.

goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, as of december 31, on a reporting unit basis, or more frequently, when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill. if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment charge is recorded in an amount equal to that excess. no goodwill impairment was identified in 2015 or 2013. in the fourth quarter of 2014, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $98.9 million in our wireless test segment as a result of decreased projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market due to reuse of wireless test equipment, price competition and different testing techniques.
24
we assess the impairment of intangible and long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends.
there were no events or circumstances indicating that the carrying value may not be recoverable in 2015 or 2013. as a result of the wireless test segment goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2014 described above, we performed an impairment test of the wireless test segments intangible and long-lived assets based on a comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the assets and there was no indication of impairment. when we determine that the carrying value of intangible and long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks.

the decrease in semiconductor test revenues of $99.3 million, or 8%, from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in system-on-a-chip (soc) product volume, driven by smaller microcontroller, power management and radio frequency test markets.
the increase in semiconductor test revenues of $277.8 million, or 27%, from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to higher soc product volume, driven by a larger application processor test market.
the increase in system test revenues of $49.1 million, or 30%, from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to higher sales in storage test of 3.5 hard disk drive testers used for testing drives for cloud storage applications.
the increase in system test revenues of $9.5 million, or 6%, from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to higher product volume in storage test driven by solid state disk testers and by production board test driven by automotive test applications, partially offset by lower defense/aerospace product sales.
wireless test revenues were approximately flat from 2014 to 2015 as an increase in cellular product volume was offset by lower connectivity product volume.
the decrease in wireless test revenues of $67.4 million, or 27%, from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to lower cellular and connectivity product volume driven by a smaller wireless test market.
the acquisition of universal robots, completed in june of 2015, added $41.9 million of revenue in 2015. universal robots is our industrial automation segment.

our product revenues decreased $23.4 million, or 2%, in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to lower soc product volume, driven by smaller microcontroller, power management and radio frequency test markets. this decrease was partially offset by higher sales in storage test of 3.5 hard disk drive testers for cloud storage and the addition of universal robots in 2015. service revenues, which are derived from the servicing of our installed base of products and include equipment maintenance contracts, repairs, extended warranties, parts sales, and applications support, increased $15.2 million or 5%.
our product revenues increased $209.1 million, or 18%, in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to an increase in soc test product volume, driven by a larger application processor test market. this increase was partially offset by lower cellular and connectivity product volume in wireless test. service revenues increased $10.8 million or 4%.
in 2015, revenues from one customer accounted for 13% of our consolidated revenues. in 2013, revenues from a different customer accounted for 12% of our consolidated revenues. in 2014, no single customer

we assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against on-hand and on-order inventory positions. forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future product demand. this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory. obsolete inventory, which represents items for which there is no demand, is fully reserved. excess inventory, which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next twelve quarters for our semiconductor test, system test and industrial automation segments and next four quarters for our wireless test segment, is written-down to estimated net realizable value.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded an inventory provision of $21.3 million included in cost of revenues, due to the following factors:
   a charge of $15.3 million due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels, of which $8.2 million was for our 2.5 hard disk drive testers in storage test, $4.5 million was in semiconductor test and $2.5 million was in wireless test; and

   a $6.0 million inventory write-down as a result of product transition in semiconductor test.

during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded an inventory provision of $22.2 million included in cost of revenues, due to the following factors:
   a charge of $15.4 million due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels, of which $8.1 million was in semiconductor test, $5.2 million was in wireless test and $2.1 million was in system test; and

28
   a $6.8 million inventory write-down as a result of product transition, of which $6.3 million was in semiconductor test and $0.5 million in wireless test.

during the year ended december 31, 2013, we recorded an inventory provision of $16.6 million included in cost of revenues, due to the following factors:
   a charge of $12.2 million due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels, of which $5.2 million was in semiconductor test, $4.2 million was in system test and $2.8 million was in wireless test; and

   a $4.4 million inventory write-down as a result of product transition in wireless test.

during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we scrapped $7.0 million, $20.8 million and $35.3 million of inventory, respectively, and sold $7.9 million, $13.1 million and $9.8 million of previously written-down or written-off inventory, respectively. as of december 31, 2015, we had inventory related reserves for amounts which had been written-down or written-off totaling $119.4 million. we have no pre-determined timeline to scrap the remaining inventory.

acquired intangible assets amortization expense decreased from 2014 to 2015 due to intangible assets that became fully amortized during the year, partially offset by increased amortization expense due to the universal robots acquisition. acquired intangible assets amortization expense decreased from 2013 to 2014 due to intangible assets that became fully amortized during the year, partially offset by increased amortization expense due to the ait acquisition.
goodwill impairment we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, as of december 31. the fourth quarter 2015 and 2013 goodwill impairment tests did not identify any goodwill impairments. in the fourth quarter of 2014, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $98.9 million in our wireless test segment as a result of decreased projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market due to reuse of wireless test equipment, price competition and different testing techniques.
further reductions in the size of the wireless test market may occur, which may result in additional goodwill impairment charges, increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories, asset write-offs and restructuring charges.
restructuring and other other during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded $3.6 million of other charges of which $5.3 million was for the increase in the fair value of the universal robots contingent consideration liability and $1.0 million for acquisition costs related to universal robots, partially offset by a $2.9 million gain from fair value adjustments to decrease the acquisition contingent consideration liability related to ztec, $1.6 million, and ait, $1.3 million.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded a $0.6 million gain from the fair value adjustment to decrease the ztec acquisition contingent consideration, partially offset by $0.4 million of acquisition costs related to ait.
restructuring during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded $1.5 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of 23 people primarily in system test and semiconductor test.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded $1.6 million of severance charges related to headcount reductions of approximately 43 people, primarily in semiconductor test and wireless test.

the increase in income before income taxes from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to a $98.9 million goodwill impairment charge related to wireless test in 2014 and lower pension expense related to actuarial losses of $17.7 million in 2015 as compared to $46.6 million in 2014. actuarial losses of $46.6 million in 2014 were primarily related to increases in life expectancy in the u.s.
the decrease in income before income taxes from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to a $98.9 million goodwill impairment charge related to wireless test and $46.6 million pension expense related to actuarial losses in 2014, partially offset by higher income due to higher revenues in semiconductor test in 2014.
income taxes income tax expense for 2015, 2014 and 2013 totaled $46.6 million, $14.1 million and $37.0 million, respectively. the effective tax rate for 2015, 2014 and 2013 was 18.4%, 14.8% and 18.3%, respectively. the
31
increase in the effective tax rate from 2014 to 2015 resulted from a shift in the geographic distribution of income which increased income subject to taxation in the united states relative to lower tax rate jurisdictions and a reduction in the benefit from u.s. research and development tax credits. these increases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by decreases associated with uncertain tax positions and a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge. the decrease in the effective tax rate from 2013 to 2014 was primarily attributable to a shift in the geographic distribution of income which decreased income subject to taxation in the united states relative to lower tax rate jurisdictions, partially offset by increases in the effective tax rate associated with uncertain tax positions and a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge.
in december 2015, teradyne entered into an agreement with the singapore economic development board which extended our singapore tax holiday under substantially similar terms to the agreement which expired on december 31, 2015. the new tax holiday is scheduled to expire on december 31, 2020. the tax savings attributable to the singapore tax holiday for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $11.5 million or $0.05 per diluted share, $13.2 million or $0.06 per diluted share and $4.7 million or $0.02 per diluted share, respectively.

the increase in operating assets was due to a $49.6 million increase in prepayments due primarily to prepayments to our contract manufacturers and a $3.7 million increase in accounts receivable, partially offset by a $22.3 million decrease in inventories.
33
the decrease in operating liabilities was due to a $2.5 million decrease in accrued employee compensation due primarily to employee stock awards payroll taxes and variable compensation payments, a $28.9 million decrease in customer advance payments and deferred revenue, and $5.5 million of retirement plan contributions, partially offset by a $13.9 million increase in other accrued liabilities, a $3.7 million increase in accounts payable due to higher fourth quarter sales volume, and a $0.7 million increase in income taxes.
investing activities during 2013 used cash of $283.3 million. in october 2013, we completed the acquisition of ztec for an initial cash purchase price, net of cash acquired, of $15.0 million. purchases of property, plant and equipment were $106.7 million. purchases of marketable securities used cash of $1,170.5 million, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities that provided cash of $516.5 million and $458.5 million, respectively. the sale of an equity investment provided cash of $34.2 million. purchases of life insurance policies used cash of $0.3 million.
financing activities during 2013 provided cash of $17.3 million, $17.6 million was from the issuance of common stock under stock option and stock purchase plans, and $2.7 million from the tax benefit related to stock options and restricted stock units, partially offset by $0.4 million of cash used for payments related to litepoint acquisition contingent consideration and $2.5 million of cash used for payments on long-term debt related to a loan in japan.
in january 2015, may 2015, august 2015 and november 2015, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share. total dividend payments in 2015 were $50.7 million.
in january 2014, our board of directors declared an initial quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share. in each of the second, third and fourth quarters of 2014, we paid a cash dividend of $0.06 per share. total dividend payments in 2014 were $37.4 million.
in january 2016, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share to be paid on march 21, 2016 to shareholders of record as of february 26, 2016. payment of future cash dividends are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend, among other things, upon our earnings, capital requirements and financial condition.
in january 2015, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of common stock. as of december 31, 2015, we repurchased 15.6 million shares of common stock at an average price of $19.20, for a total cost of $300.0 million. in 2016, we intend to repurchase between $100 million and $200 million of common stock.
we believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance will be sufficient to pay our quarterly dividend, execute our authorized share repurchase program and meet our working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months. the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in the u.s. and our operations in the u.s. provide sufficient liquidity to fund our business activities in the u.s. we have approximately $588 million of cash outside the u.s. that if repatriated would incur additional taxes. determination of the additional taxes that would be incurred is not practicable due to uncertainty regarding the remittance structure, the mix of earnings and earnings and profit pools in the year of remittance, and overall complexity of the calculation. inflation has not had a significant long-term impact on earnings.
retirement plans asc 715-20, compensation  retirement benefits  defined benefit plans requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by asc 715-20. the pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plans assets and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31. for other postretirement benefit plans, the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31.

our pension expense, which includes the u.s. qualified pension plan (u.s. plan), certain qualified plans for non-u.s. subsidiaries, and a u.s. supplemental executive defined benefit plan, was approximately $21.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. the largest portion of our 2015 pension expense was $10.5 million for our u.s. plan. pension expense or income is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions. discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expense/income and asset/liability measurement. we evaluate our discount rate and expected rate of return on assets assumptions annually on a plan and country specific basis. we evaluate other assumptions related to demographic factors, such as retirement age, mortality and turnover periodically, and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. in the fourth quarter of 2014, we updated the mortality assumptions related to our u.s retirement plans using the mortality tables published in october 2014 by the u.s. society of actuaries. the change in the mortality assumptions resulted in approximately $39.0 million of actuarial losses in 2014 for the u.s. retirement plans.
in developing the expected return on u.s. plan assets assumption, we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants, including their review of asset class return expectations. based on this review, we believe that 4.8% was an appropriate rate to use for 2015. the december 31, 2015 asset allocation for our u.s. plan was 89% invested in fixed income securities, 10% invested in equity securities, and 1% invested in other securities. our investment manager regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our target allocations.
we recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of plans assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans. we calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets. actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of december 31 and, accordingly, recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans.
the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the u.s. plan is based on the citigroup pension index adjusted for the u.s. plans expected cash flows and was 4.0% at december 31, 2015, up from 3.7% at december 31, 2014. we estimate that in 2016 we will recognize approximately $0.5 million of pension income for the u.s. plan. the u.s. plan pension income estimate for 2016 is based on a 4.0% discount rate and a 4.8% return on assets. future pension expense or income will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans.
as of december 31, 2015, our pension plans had unrecognized pension prior service cost of $0.2 million.
we performed a sensitivity analysis, which expresses the potential u.s. plan (income) expense for the year ending december 31, 2016, which would result from changes to either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets. the below estimates exclude the impact of any potential actuarial gains or losses. it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be any actuarial gains or losses in 2016 as they are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control, such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets.

the assets of the u.s. plan consist substantially of fixed income securities. u.s. plan assets have decreased from $316.1 million at december 31, 2014 to $298.4 million at december 31, 2015 while the u.s. plans liability decreased from $313.0 million at december 31, 2014 to $297.8 million at december 31, 2015.

our funding policy is to make contributions to our pension plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible. during 2015, we made contributions of $8.0 million to the u.s. plan, $2.5 million to the u.s. supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan and $0.8 million to certain qualified plans for non-u.s. subsidiaries. we expect to contribute approximately $2.6 million to the u.s. supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan in 2016. contributions to be made in 2016 to certain qualified plans for non-u.s. subsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and are estimated at approximately $0.8 million. we do not expect to make any contributions to the u.s. plan in 2016.
equity compensation plans in addition to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan discussed in note n: stock based compensation in notes to consolidated financial statements, we have a 2006 equity and cash compensation incentive plan (the 2006 equity plan) under which equity securities are authorized for issuance. the 2006 equity plan was initially approved by stockholders on may 25, 2006.
at our annual meeting of stockholders held may 21, 2013, our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 equity plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 10.0 million, for an aggregate of 32.0 million shares issuable thereunder, and our stockholders also approved an amendment to our 1996 employee stock purchase plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 5.0 million, for an aggregate of 30.4 million shares issuable thereunder.
the following table presents information about these plans as of december 31, 2015 (share numbers in thousands):

(2)   consists of 10,913,160 securities available for issuance under the 2006 equity plan and 4,876,424 of securities available for issuance under the employee stock purchase plan.

(3)                                               in connection with the 2008 acquisition of nextest (the nextest acquisition), we assumed the options and restricted stock units granted under the nextest systems corporation 1998 equity incentive plan, as amended, and the nextest systems corporation 2006 equity incentive plan (collectively, the nextest plans). upon the consummation of the nextest acquisition, these options and restricted stock units were converted automatically into, respectively, options to purchase and restricted stock units representing, an aggregate of 4,417,594 shares of our common stock. no additional awards will be granted under the nextest plans. as of december 31, 2015, there were outstanding options exercisable for an aggregate of 4,528 shares of our common stock pursuant to the nextest plans, with a weighted average exercise price of $5.72 per share.

(4)                                                   in connection with the 2008 acquisition of eagle test (the eagle acquisition), we assumed the options granted under the eagle test systems, inc. 2003 stock option and grant plan and the eagle test systems, inc. 2006 stock option and incentive plan (collectively, the eagle plans). upon the consummation of the eagle acquisition, these options were converted automatically into options to purchase an aggregate of 3,594,916 shares of our common stock. no additional awards will be granted under the eagle plans. as of

december 31, 2015, there were outstanding options exercisable for an aggregate of 94,980 shares of our common stock pursuant to the eagle plans, with a weighted average exercise price of
$3.87 per share.

(5)                                              in connection with the 2011 acquisition of litepoint corporation (the litepoint acquisition), we assumed the options granted under the litepoint corporation
2002 stock plan (the litepoint plan). upon the consummation of the litepoint acquisition, these options were converted automatically into options to purchase an aggregate of 2,828,344 shares of our common stock. no additional awards will be granted under the litepoint plan. as of december 31, 2015, there were outstanding options exercisable for an aggregate of 457,192 shares of our common stock pursuant to the litepoint plan, with a weighted average exercise price of $2.70 per share.

the purpose of the 2006 equity plan is to motivate employees, officers and directors by providing equity ownership and compensation opportunities in teradyne. the aggregate number of shares available under the 2006 equity plan as of december 31, 2015 was 10,913,160 shares of our common stock. the 2006 equity plan authorizes the grant of stock-based awards in the form of (1) non-qualified and incentive stock options, (2) stock appreciation rights, (3) restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards, (4) phantom stock, and (5) other stock-based awards. awards may be tied to time-based vesting schedules and/or performance-based vesting measured by reference to performance criteria chosen by the compensation committee of the board of directors, which administers the 2006 equity plan. awards may be made to any employee, officer, consultant and advisor of teradyne and our subsidiaries, as well as, to our directors. the maximum number of shares of stock-based awards that may be granted to one participant during any one fiscal year is 2,000,000 shares of common stock. the 2006 equity plan will expire on may 12, 2025.
as of december 31, 2015, total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock units and options was $44.9 million, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.3 years.
performance graph the following graph compares the change in our cumulative total shareholder return in our common stock with the standard & poors 500 index, the philadelphia semiconductor index, the nyse composite index and the morningstar semiconductor equipment & materials index. the comparison assumes $100.00 was invested on december 31, 2010 in our common stock and in each of the foregoing indices and assumes reinvestment of dividends, if any. historic stock price performance is not necessarily indicative of future price performance. this is the last year that we will compare ourselves to the standard & poors 500 index and the philadelphia semiconductor index. going forward, we will compare ourselves to (1) the nyse composite index, as we are no
37
longer included in the standard & poors 500 index, and (2) the morningstar semiconductor equipment & materials industry group (compiled by morningstar, inc.) as this better aligns us with companies in the broader semiconductor equipment industry.
recently issued accounting pronouncements in november 2015, the fasb issued accounting standards update (asu) 2015-17, balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. asu 2015-17 is aimed at reducing complexity in accounting standards. currently gaap requires the deferred taxes for each jurisdiction to be presented as a net current asset or liability and net noncurrent asset or liability. this requires a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction analysis based on the classification of the assets and liabilities to which the underlying temporary differences relate, or, in the case of loss or credit carryforwards, based on the period in which the attribute is expected to be realized. any valuation allowance is then required to be allocated on a pro rata basis, by jurisdiction, between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets. to simplify presentation, the new guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. as a result, each jurisdiction will now only have one net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability. the guidance does not change the existing requirement that only permits offsetting within a jurisdiction; companies are still prohibited from offsetting deferred tax liabilities from one jurisdiction against deferred tax assets of another jurisdiction. the new guidance is effective in fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2016, including interim periods within those years. early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. the guidance may be applied either prospectively, for all deferred tax assets and liabilities, or retrospectively by reclassifying the comparative balance sheet. we will early adopt this asu prospectively in january 2016. this asu is expected to have no impact on our results of operations.
in september 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-16, business combinations (topic 805)simplifying the accounting for measurement-period adjustments. asu 2015-16 requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustments are identified, including the cumulative effect of the change in provisional amount as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. asu 2015-16 is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2015 and is applied prospectively. early adoption is permitted. we early adopted this asu in the three months ended october 4, 2015. adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.
38
in april 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-03, simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs, which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, consistent with the presentation for debt discount. asu 2015-03 does not specifically address requirements for the presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. on august 8, 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-15, interestimputation of interest (subtopic 835-30) clarifying that debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements could be presented as an asset and amortized over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. for teradyne, the standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2015, and interim periods within those years. this asu is expected to have no impact on our financial position and results of operations.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606), which will replace numerous requirements in u.s. gaap, including industry-specific requirements, and provide companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. the core principle of the new standard is that a company should recognize revenue to show the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. in august 2015, fasb issued asu 2015-14, which deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard by 1 year. for teradyne, the standard will be effective in the first quarter of 2018. early adoption is permitted but not before the original effective date (that is, annual periods beginning after december 15, 2016). the two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application. we have not yet selected a transition method. we are currently evaluating the impact of this asu on our financial position and results of operations.

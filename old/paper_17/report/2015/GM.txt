item 1a. risk factors we face a number of significant risks and uncertainties in connection with our operations. our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the factors described below. while we describe each risk separately, some of these risks are interrelated and certain risks could trigger the applicability of other risks described below.
our ability to maintain profitability over the long-term is dependent upon our ability to fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers.
we operate in a very competitive industry with market participants routinely introducing new and improved vehicle models designed to meet rapidly evolving consumer expectations. producing new and improved vehicle models competitively and preserving our reputation for designing, building and selling high quality cars and trucks is critical to our long-term profitability. we will launch a substantial number of new vehicles in 2016. successful launches of our new vehicles are critical to our short-term profitability. in addition, our growth strategies require us to make significant investment in our brands to appeal to new markets.
our long-term profitability depends upon our successfully creating and funding technological innovations in design, engineering and manufacturing, which requires extensive capital investment and the ability to retain and recruit talent. in some cases the technologies that we plan to employ are not yet commercially practical and depend on significant future technological advances by us and by our suppliers. although we will seek to obtain intellectual property protection for our innovations to protect our competitive position, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. there can be no assurance that advances in technology will occur in a timely or feasible way, or that others will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do or that we will acquire technologies on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage.
it generally takes two years or more to design and develop a new vehicle, and a number of factors may lengthen that time period. because of this product development cycle and the various elements that may contribute to consumers' acceptance of new vehicle designs, including competitors' product introductions, technological innovations, fuel prices, general economic conditions and changes in styling preferences, an initial product concept or design may not result in a vehicle that generates sales in sufficient quantities and at high enough prices to be profitable. our high proportion of fixed costs, both due to our significant investment in property, plant and equipment as well as other requirements of our collective bargaining agreements, which limit our flexibility to adjust personnel costs to changes in demands for our products, may further exacerbate the risks associated with incorrectly assessing demand for our vehicles.
our profitability is dependent upon the success of full-size pick-up trucks and suvs.
while we offer a balanced and complete portfolio of small, mid-size and large cars, crossovers, suvs and trucks, we generally recognize higher profit margins on our full-size pick-up trucks and suvs. our success is dependent upon consumer preferences and our ability to sell higher margin vehicles in sufficient volumes. any increases in the price of oil or any sustained shortage of
12
general motors company and subsidiaries oil, including as a result of global political instability, could cause a shift in consumer demand towards smaller, more fuel efficient vehicles, and weaken the demand for our higher margin full-size pick-up trucks and suvs.
our business is highly dependent upon the global automobile market sales volume, which can be volatile.
our business and financial results are highly sensitive to sales volume, changes to which can have a disproportionately large effect on our profitability. a number of economic and market conditions drive changes in vehicle sales, including real estate values, levels of unemployment, availability of affordable financing, fluctuations in the cost of fuel, consumer confidence, political unrest and global economic conditions. we cannot predict future economic and market conditions with certainty.
our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic and market conditions.
maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy. the automotive market in china is highly competitive, with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers. as the size of the chinese market continues to increase we anticipate that additional competitors, both international and domestic, will seek to enter the chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase their market share. increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share. in addition our business in china is sensitive to economic and market conditions that drive sales volume in china.
a significant amount of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit.
many of our operations, primarily in china, are carried out by joint ventures. in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint venture. joint ventures are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions. in joint ventures we are required to foster our relationships with our co-owners as well as promote the overall success of the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes or relationships deteriorate, our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected. the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners; therefore, we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures. in addition, because we share ownership and management with one or more parties, we may have limited control over the actions of a joint venture, particularly when we own a minority interest. as a result, we may be unable to prevent misconduct or other violations of applicable laws by a joint venture. moreover, a joint venture may not follow the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow. to the extent another party makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control issues arise within the joint venture, we may have to take responsive or other action or we may be subject to penalties, fines or other related actions for these activities that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our businesses outside the u.s. expose us to additional risks.
the majority of our vehicles are sold outside the u.s. we are pursuing growth opportunities for our business in a variety of business environments outside the u.s. operating in a large number of different regions and countries exposes us to political, economic and other risks as well as multiple foreign regulatory requirements that are subject to change, including:
•   changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates;
•   economic downturns in foreign countries or geographic regions where we have significant operations, such as china;
•   economic tensions between governments and changes in international trade and investment policies, including imposing restrictions on the repatriation of dividends, especially between the u.s. and china, more detailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to entry;
•   changes in foreign regulations impacting our overall business model restricting our ability to buy and sell our products in those countries, especially china;
•   differing local product preferences and product requirements, including fuel economy, vehicle emissions and safety;
•   impact of compliance with u.s. and other foreign countries' export controls and economic sanctions;
•   liabilities resulting from u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to the foreign corrupt practices act and certain other anti-corruption laws;
13
general motors company and subsidiaries
•   differing labor regulations and union relationships;
•   consequences from changes in tax laws; and
•   difficulties in obtaining financing in foreign countries for local operations.
we are subject to extensive laws, governmental regulations and policies, including those regarding fuel economy and emissions control, the enforcement of which or changes to existing ones, could cause us to incur increased costs or to face regulatory enforcement action and may have a significant effect on how we do business.
we are significantly affected by governmental regulations that can increase costs related to the production of our vehicles and affect our product portfolio. meeting or exceeding many of these regulations is costly and often technologically challenging, especially where standards may not be harmonized across jurisdictions, a notable challenge with respect to mandated emissions and fuel economy standards. we anticipate that the number and extent of these regulations, and the related costs and changes to our product lineup, may increase significantly in the future. these government regulatory requirements could significantly affect our plans for global product development and given the uncertainty surrounding enforcement and regulatory definitions, may result in substantial costs, including civil or criminal penalties. in addition, an evolving but un-harmonized regulatory framework may limit or dictate the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them, which can affect revenue. refer to the "environmental and regulatory matters" section of item 1. business for a discussion of these regulatory requirements. we also expect that manufacturers will be subject to increased scrutiny from regulators globally as a result of the well-publicized emissions scandal involving an unrelated automotive manufacturer in 2015. for example, government agencies in several countries have asked us for information; one of these, the german ministry of transportation, is requesting the participation of a number of automotive manufacturers, including our german subsidiary, in discussions on emissions control issues and has requested a written response from our subsidiary on the subject. this scrutiny, regulatory changes and increased enforcement may lead to increased testing and re-testing of our vehicles and analysis of their emissions control systems, which could lead to increased costs, penalties, negative publicity or reputational impact, and recall activity if regulators determine that emission levels and required regulatory compliance should be based on either a wider spectrum of driving conditions for future testing parameters or stricter or novel interpretations and consequent enforcement of existing requirements. no assurance can be given that the ultimate outcome of any potential investigations or increased testing resulting from this scrutiny would not materially and adversely affect us.
we are committed to meeting or exceeding fuel economy and emission control requirements. we expect that to comply with these requirements we will be required to sell a significant volume of hybrid electric vehicles, as well as implement new technologies for conventional internal combustion engines, all at increased cost levels. there is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicles that use such technologies on a profitable basis or that our customers will purchase such vehicles in the quantities necessary for us to comply with these regulatory programs. alternative compliance measures may not be sufficiently available in the marketplace to meet volume driven compliance requirements.
environmental liabilities for which we may be responsible are not reasonably estimable and could be substantial. violations of safety or emissions standards could result in the recall of one or more of our products, negotiated remedial actions, possible fines, restricted product offerings or a combination of any of those items. any of these actions could have substantial adverse effects on our operations including facility idling, reduced employment, increased costs and loss of revenue.
we could be materially adversely affected by a negative outcome in unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations or other legal proceedings.
we are subject to legal proceedings involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, stockholder litigation and governmental investigations, such as the legal proceedings related to the ignition switch recall. refer to the "gm north america" section of md&a for additional information on the ignition switch recall. such legal proceedings could in the future result in the imposition of damages, including punitive damages, substantial fines, civil lawsuits and criminal penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well as significant legal and other costs. for a further discussion of these matters refer to note 15 to our consolidated financial statements.
if, in the discretion of the u.s. attorney's office for the southern district of new york (the office), we do not comply with the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement (the dpa), the office may prosecute us for charges alleged by the office including those relating to faulty ignition switches.
on september 17, 2015 we announced that we entered into the dpa with the office regarding its investigation of the events leading up to certain recalls announced in february and march 2014 relating to faulty ignition switches. under the dpa, we
14
general motors company and subsidiaries consented to, among other things, the filing of a two-count information (the information) in the u.s. district court for the southern district of new york charging gm with a scheme to conceal material facts from a government regulator and wire fraud. we pled not guilty to the charges alleged in the information. the dpa further provides that, in the event the office determines during the period of deferral of prosecution (or any extensions thereof) that we have violated any provision of the dpa, including violating any u.s. federal law or our obligation to cooperate with and assist the independent monitor, the office may, in its discretion, either prosecute us on the charges alleged in the information or impose an extension of the period of deferral of prosecution of up to one additional year. under such circumstance, the office would be permitted to rely upon the admissions we made in the dpa and would benefit from our waiver of certain procedural and evidentiary defenses. such a criminal prosecution could subject us to penalties that could have material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
the costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls could materially adversely affect our business.
government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns. under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for free repairs. at present, the costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. we currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts, including but not limited to air bag inflators, from third parties. from time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs. for example, based on defect information reports filed with nhtsa by tk holdings inc. (takata), we are currently conducting recalls for certain takata air bag inflators used in some of our prior model year vehicles. we are continuing to assess the situation. further recalls, if any, that may be required to remediate takata air bag inflators in our vehicles could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. in addition product recalls can harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers, particularly if those recalls cause consumers to question the safety or reliability of our products. conversely not issuing a recall or not issuing a recall on a timely basis can harm our reputation, potentially expose us to significant monetary penalties, and cause us to lose customers for the same reasons as expressed above.
any disruption in our suppliers' operations could disrupt our production schedule.
our automotive operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the systems, components, raw materials and parts that we need to manufacture our products. our use of "just-in-time" manufacturing processes allows us to maintain minimal inventory quantities of systems, components, raw materials and parts. as a result our ability to maintain production is dependent upon our suppliers delivering sufficient quantities of systems, components, raw materials and parts on time to meet our production schedules. in some instances we purchase systems, components, raw materials and parts from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. financial difficulties or solvency problems with our suppliers, which may be exacerbated by the cost of remediating quality issues with these items, could lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruptions for us which could, in turn, disrupt our operations, including production of certain of our higher margin vehicles. where we experience supply disruptions, we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly. any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of systems, components, raw materials or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules or suspend production entirely.
we are dependent on our manufacturing facilities around the world.
we assemble vehicles at various facilities around the world. these facilities are typically designed to produce particular models for particular geographic markets. no single facility is designed to manufacture our full range of vehicles. in some cases certain facilities produce products that disproportionately contribute a greater degree of profit to the company than others. should these or other facilities become unavailable either temporarily or permanently for any number of reasons, including labor disruptions, the inability to manufacture vehicles there may result in harm to our reputation, increased costs, lower revenues and the loss of customers. we may not be able to easily shift production of vehicles at an inoperable facility to other facilities or to make up for lost production. any new facility needed to replace an inoperable manufacturing facility would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirements, need to satisfy our specialized manufacturing requirements and require specialized equipment. even though we carry business interruption insurance policies, we may suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available or any losses which may be excluded under our insurance policies.
if we do not deliver new products, services and customer experiences in response to new participants in the automotive industry, our business could suffer.
15
general motors company and subsidiaries we believe that the automotive industry will experience more change in the next five years than it has in the previous 50 years. in addition to our traditional competitors, we must also be responsive to the entrance of non-traditional participants in the automotive industry. these non-traditional participants may seek to disrupt the historic business model of the industry through the introduction of new technologies, new products or services, new business models or new methods of travel. it is strategically significant that we lead the technological disruption occurring in our industry. as our business evolves, the pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services, including products and services that may be outside of our historically core business. if we do not accurately predict, prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations, market developments and changing customer needs, our sales, profitability and long-term competitiveness may be harmed.
we operate in a highly competitive industry that has excess manufacturing capacity and attempts by our competitors to sell more vehicles could have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing, market share and operating results.
the global automotive industry is highly competitive and overall manufacturing capacity in the industry exceeds demand. many manufacturers have relatively high fixed labor costs as well as significant limitations on their ability to close facilities and reduce fixed costs. our competitors may respond to these relatively high fixed costs by providing subsidized financing or leasing programs, offering marketing incentives or reducing vehicle prices. our competitors may also seek to benefit from economies of scale by consolidating or entering into other strategic agreements such as alliances intended to enhance their competitiveness.
manufacturers in lower cost countries, such as china and india, have become competitors in key emerging markets and announced their intention of exporting their products to established markets as a low cost alternative to established entry-level automobiles. these actions have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing, market share and operating results, and present a significant risk to our ability to enhance our revenue per vehicle.
we may continue to restructure our operations in various countries, but we may not succeed in doing so.
we face difficult market and operating conditions in certain parts of the world that may require us to restructure, impair or rationalize these operations. in many countries across our regions we have experienced challenges in our operations and continue to strategically assess the manner in which we operate in certain countries. as we continue to assess our performance throughout the regions, additional restructuring, impairment and rationalization actions may be required and may be material.
our future competitiveness and ability to achieve long-term profitability depends on our ability to control our costs, which requires us to successfully implement operating effectiveness initiatives throughout our automotive operations.
we are continuing to implement a number of operating effectiveness initiatives to improve productivity and reduce costs. our future competitiveness depends upon our continued success in implementing these initiatives throughout our automotive operations. while some of the elements of cost reduction are within our control, others, such as interest rates or return on investments, which influence our expense for pensions, depend more on external factors, and there can be no assurance that such external factors will not materially adversely affect our ability to reduce our costs. reducing costs may prove difficult due to our focus on increasing advertising and our belief that engineering expenses necessary to improve the performance, safety and customer satisfaction of our vehicles are likely to increase.
security breaches and other disruptions to our vehicles, information technology networks and systems could interfere with the safety of our customers or our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of private customer data or our proprietary information.
we rely upon information technology networks and systems, including in-vehicle systems and mobile devices, some of which are managed by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of vehicle or business processes and activities. additionally we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, propriety business information of our dealers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. the secure operation of these information technology networks and in-vehicle systems, and the processing and maintenance of this information, is critical to our business operations and strategy. despite security measures and business continuity plans, our information technology networks and systems and in-vehicle systems may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees, contractors and others who have access to our networks and systems or computer viruses. the occurrence of any of these events could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. these occurrences could also impact vehicle safety. we have been the target of these types of attacks in the past with no known material impacts and future attacks are likely to occur. if successful, these types of attacks on our network
16
general motors company and subsidiaries or systems, including in-vehicle systems and mobile devices, or service failures could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, due to, among other things, the loss of proprietary data, interruptions or delays in our business operations and damage to our reputation. in addition any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations and reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technologies. our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to significant security attacks or disruptions resulting from such attacks.
we rely on gm financial to provide financial services to our dealers and customers in a majority of the markets in which we sell vehicles. gm financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations and its ability to provide leasing and financing to retail consumers and commercial lending to our dealers to support additional sales of our vehicles.
we rely on gm financial in north america, europe, south america and china to support leasing and sales of our vehicles to consumers requiring vehicle financing and also to provide commercial lending to our dealers. any reduction of gm financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among consumers and dealers.
as an entity operating in the financial services sector, gm financial is required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations that may be costly to adhere to and may affect our consolidated operating results. compliance with these laws and regulations requires that gm financial maintain forms, processes, procedures, controls and the infrastructure to support these requirements and these laws and regulations often create operational constraints both on gm financial's ability to implement servicing procedures and on pricing. laws in the financial services industry are designed primarily for the protection of consumers. the failure to comply with these laws could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalties, monetary damages, attorneys' fees and costs, possible revocation of licenses and damage to reputation, brand and valued customer relationships.
the primary factors that could adversely affect gm financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services at competitive rates include:
•   the availability of borrowings under its credit facilities to fund its retail and dealer finance activities;
•   its ability to access a variety of financing sources including the asset-backed securities market and other secured and unsecured debt markets;
•   the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by delinquencies, defaults or prepayments;
•   wholesale auction values of used vehicles;
•   higher than expected vehicle return rates and the residual value performance on vehicles gm financial leases to customers;
•   fluctuations in interest rates and currencies; and
•   changes to regulation, supervision and licensing across various jurisdictions, including new regulations or sanctions imposed in the u.s. by the department of justice, sec and consumer financial protection bureau.
our defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded and our pension funding requirements could increase significantly due to a reduction in funded status as a result of a variety of factors, including weak performance of financial markets, declining interest rates, changes in laws or regulations, changes in assumptions or investments that do not achieve adequate returns.
our employee benefit plans currently hold a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities. a detailed description of the investment funds and strategies is disclosed in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements, which also describes significant concentrations of risk to the plan investments.
there are additional risks due to the complexity and magnitude of our investments. examples include implementation of significant changes in investment policy, insufficient market liquidity in particular asset classes and the inability to quickly rebalance illiquid and long-term investments.
our future funding requirements for our u.s. defined benefit pension plans depend upon the future performance of assets placed in trusts for these plans, the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels, the level of benefits provided for by the plans
17
general motors company and subsidiaries and any changes in government laws and regulations. future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset returns are lower than expected asset returns, assuming other factors are held constant. our potential funding requirements are described in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
factors which affect future funding requirements for our u.s. defined benefit plans generally affect the required funding for non-u.s. plans. certain plans outside the u.s. do not have assets and therefore the obligation is funded as benefits are paid. if local legal authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our non-u.s. plans, we could be required to contribute more funds.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this md&a should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
non-gaap measures management uses earnings before interest and taxes (ebit)-adjusted to review the operating results of our automotive segments because it excludes interest income, interest expense and income taxes as well as certain additional adjustments. gm financial uses income before income taxes-adjusted because management believes interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment. examples of adjustments to ebit and gm financial's income before income taxes include certain impairment charges related to goodwill, other long-lived assets and investments; certain gains or losses on the settlement/extinguishment of obligations; and gains or losses on the sale of non-core investments. refer to note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for our reconciliation of these non-gaap measures to the most directly comparable financial measure under u.s. gaap, net income attributable to stockholders.
management uses earnings per share (eps)-diluted-adjusted to review our consolidated diluted earnings per share results on a consistent basis. eps-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholders less certain adjustments
20
general motors company and subsidiaries noted above for ebit-adjusted on an after-tax basis as well as certain income tax adjustments divided by weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted.
management uses return on invested capital (roic) to review investment and capital allocation decisions. we define roic as ebit-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for certain assets and liabilities during the same period.
management uses adjusted free cash flow to review the liquidity of our automotive operations. we measure adjusted free cash flow as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions, primarily related to strengthening our balance sheet, such as accrued interest on prepayments of debt and voluntary contributions to employee benefit plans. refer to the "liquidity and capital resources" section of md&a for our reconciliation of this non-gaap measure to the most directly comparable financial measure under u.s. gaap, net cash provided by operating activities.
management uses these non-gaap measures in its financial and operational decision making processes, for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes as they provide additional transparency of our core operations. these measures allow management and investors to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions.
our calculation of these non-gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. as a result the use of these non-gaap measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for, related u.s. gaap measures.
the following table reconciles eps-diluted-adjusted to its most comparable financial measure under u.s. gaap diluted earnings per common share:

overview our strategic plan includes several major initiatives that we anticipate will help us achieve 9% to 10% margins on an ebit-adjusted basis (ebit-adjusted margins, calculated as ebit-adjusted divided by net sales and revenue) by early next decade: earn customers for life by delivering great products to our customers, leading the industry in quality and safety and improving the customer ownership experience; lead in technology and innovation, including onstar 4g lte and connected car, alternative
21
general motors company and subsidiaries propulsion, urban mobility including ride and car sharing, active safety features and autonomous vehicles; grow our brands, particularly the cadillac brand in the u.s. and china and the chevrolet brand globally; continue our growth in china; continue the growth of gm financial into our full captive automotive financing company; and deliver core operating efficiencies.
for the year ending december 31, 2016 we expect to continue to generate strong consolidated financial results including improved ebit-adjusted and ebit-adjusted margins, eps-diluted-adjusted of between $5.25 and $5.75 and automotive adjusted free cash flow of approximately $6 billion.
our overall financial targets include expected improvement of forecasted consolidated ebit-adjusted margins of 9% to 10% by early next decade; expected total annual operational and functional cost savings of $5.5 billion by 2018 that will more than offset our incremental investments in brand building, engineering and technology as we launch new products in 2016 and beyond; expected average adjusted automotive free cash flow of approximately $6 billion to $7 billion from 2016 to 2018; expected consolidated roic of 20% plus; and execution of our capital allocation strategy as described below.
automotive summary and outlook we analyze the results of our automotive business through our four geographically-based segments:
gmna automotive industry volume continued to grow in north america primarily driven by the u.s. market. in 2015 u.s. industry light vehicle sales were 17.5 million units, up 1.0 million units from 2014. based on our current cost structure and variable profit margins, we estimate gmna's breakeven point at the u.s. industry level to be in the range of 10.0 - 11.0 million units.
in the year ended december 31, 2015 our u.s. vehicle sales totaled 3.1 million units for a u.s. market share of 17.3%, representing a decrease of 0.1 percentage points compared to 2014. the decrease in our u.s. market share was primarily driven by lower fleet market share, partially offset by higher retail market share. u.s. retail market share, which is generally more profitable than u.s. fleet market share, increased by 0.4 percentage points, primarily driven by chevrolet and gmc.
we achieved ebit-adjusted margins of 10.3% during 2015. ebit-adjusted margin improvements were impacted by favorable volumes and mix and favorable cost performance including materials, logistics and recall-related charges. refer to the "gm north america" section of the md&a for additional information on recall activity. we expect to sustain an ebit-adjusted margin of 10% in 2016 due to a consistent to slight increase in u.s. industry light vehicle sales, key product launches, continued cost performance and growth of adjacent businesses.
in november 2015 we entered into a collectively bargained labor agreement with the uaw. the agreement, which has a term of four years, covers the wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions of employment for our uaw represented employees. the key terms and provisions of the agreement are:
•   lump sum payments to eligible u.s. hourly employees with seniority of $8,000 and eligible temporary employees of $2,000 were paid in december 2015 totaling $0.4 billion.
•   two lump sum payments equivalent to 4% of qualified earnings will be paid to eligible traditional and in-progression employees in september 2016 and 2018 totaling $0.2 billion. additional lump sum payments of $1,000 will be paid annually to eligible employees with seniority in june 2016 through june 2019 totaling $0.2 billion. all of these lump sum payments are being amortized over the term of the agreement.
•   an annual payment of $500 will be paid each december through 2018 to eligible u.s. hourly employees with seniority upon attainment of specific u.s. vehicle quality targets.
•   a $500 payment was made to each retiree in december 2015 totaling $0.1 billion.
•   an increase in base wages was made for all eligible employees with seniority as well as temporary employees hired prior to the expiration of the 2011 agreement.
•   amended the supplemental unemployment benefits program, resulting in a $0.3 billion favorable adjustment in the three months ended december 31, 2015. refer to note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.

•   cash severance incentive programs to qualified u.s. hourly production employees of approximately $0.3 billion based on employee interest, eligibility and management approval. the restructuring charges will be recorded in 2016 upon acceptance.
gme automotive industry sales to retail and fleet customers began to improve in late 2013. as a result of moderate economic growth across europe (excluding russia) this trend continued in the year ended december 31, 2015 with industry sales to retail and fleet customers of 17.7 million vehicles representing a 9.3% increase compared to 2014. in russia industry sales to retail and fleet customers decreased 36.1% to 1.6 million vehicles compared to the corresponding period in 2014.
our european operations are benefiting from this trend and, despite seasonally weak vehicle sales in the second half of 2015 compared to the first half of 2015, continue to show signs of improvement underscored by further improvement in our opel and vauxhall market share in the year ended december 31, 2015, which builds on our market share increases in 2013 and 2014.
we continue to implement various strategic actions to strengthen our operations and increase our competitiveness. the key actions include investments in our product portfolio including the recently launched next generation opel astra and corsa, a revised brand strategy and reducing material, development and production costs, including restructuring activities. the success of these actions will depend on a combination of our ability to execute and external factors which are outside of our control.
economic and market conditions in russia remain and are expected to continue to be very challenging for the foreseeable future. in addition we do not have appropriate localization levels for key vehicles built in russia and we would need to make significant future capital investments in order to improve our localization levels so that our products are competitive in the russian market. as a result of these conditions we determined that our russia business model was not sustainable over the long term. in 2015 we ceased manufacturing, eliminated opel brand distribution and minimized chevrolet brand distribution in russia. refer to note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the impact of the change in our business model in russia.
in addition to the impact of the restructuring of our russia business model, we anticipate headwinds from aggressive industry pricing along with increased costs associated with depreciation, amortization, marketing, adverse foreign currency impact and increased costs associated with our new product launches. we anticipate these headwinds will be offset by continued industry recovery, the full benefits of our recent launches of the astra and corsa and material cost optimization. as a result we intend to break even in gme in 2016.
the german ministry of transportation is requesting the participation of a number of automotive manufacturers, including our german subsidiary, in discussions on emission controls issues and has requested a written response from our subsidiary on the subject. this request may lead to increased testing and re-testing of our vehicles and analysis of their emissions control systems, which could lead to increased costs, penalties, negative publicity or reputational impact, and additional vehicles may be subject to recall activity if regulators determine that emission levels and required regulatory compliance should be based on either a wider spectrum of driving conditions for future testing parameters or stricter or novel interpretations and consequent enforcement of existing requirements. no assurance can be given that the ultimate outcome of any potential investigations or increased testing resulting from this scrutiny would not materially and adversely affect us. refer to item 1a. risk factors for additional information.
gmio in the year ended december 31, 2015 gmio operated in a volatile and challenging economic environment.
in china we are experiencing a moderation of industry growth and pricing pressures higher than we initially anticipated due primarily to macroeconomic volatility, softening consumer demand particularly in the commercial vehicle segment, increasing competition and a complex regulatory environment. this has resulted in 4.2% growth in industry sales to 25.1 million units in 2015. despite these pressures, we achieved record wholesale volumes of 3.7 million units with market share of 14.9% in the year ended december 31, 2015, up 0.2 percentage points compared to 2014. the increase in our market share was primarily driven by our successful launches in our key growth segments of suvs, multipurpose vehicles and luxury vehicles including the buick envision and baojun 560 and 730. baojun 560 became the second best-selling suv in china two months after its launch and the baojun 730 has been the market leader in its segment since launching in august 2014. we opened two new facilities in 2015 and will be adding a third jinqiao shanghai plant in 2016 consistent with our localization strategy.

general motors company and subsidiaries in the year ended december 31, 2015 our automotive china jvs generated equity income of $2.1 billion and sustained strong margins, despite higher than anticipated pricing pressures with carryover price reductions of approximately 5% for saic general motors corp., ltd. (sgm) and moderation of industry growth. this was largely attributed to proactive management of challenges by optimizing vehicle mix and inventory levels and aggressively reducing costs. in 2016 we expect continuation of moderate industry growth, macroeconomic volatility and carryover pricing pressures in the range of 3% to 5%. despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, we continue to expect an increase in vehicle sales driven by new launches and expect to sustain strong china equity income and margins by focusing on vehicle mix improvement and cost efficiency.
lack of political stability, decreasing prices of natural resources and foreign exchange volatility, among other factors, negatively impacted the overall automotive industry in the rest of asia pacific, africa and the middle east and led to a decrease of 0.2 million units, or 1.0%, in the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 2014. this continued the recent trend of a relatively flat industry of approximately 19 million units sold in each of the last several years. in the year ended december 31, 2015 our sales volume decreased by 5.2% compared to 2014, leading to a decline in market share of 0.2 percentage points to 4.2%.
in 2016 we expect the macroeconomic environment to remain challenging. we continue to refresh our product portfolio and are addressing many of the challenges in these markets while continuing to strategically assess the manner in which we operate in certain countries. to address the significant industry, market share, pricing and foreign exchange pressures in the region, we continue to focus on product portfolio enhancements, manufacturing footprint rationalization, increased local sourcing of parts, cost structure reductions, as well as brand and dealer network improvements which we expect to favorably impact the region over the medium term. the impact of these strategic actions combined with the significant reduction in wholesale volumes, forward pricing pressures and foreign exchange volatility in the region may result in deteriorating cash flows in certain markets.
in 2013 we announced the withdrawal of the chevrolet brand from western and central europe and the ceasing of manufacturing and significant reduction of engineering operations in australia by 2017 and incurred related impairment and other charges in the years ended december 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015. we continue to work on a southeast asia transformation plan including the transition of our indonesian operations to a national sales company and ceased vehicle production in indonesia in the three months ended june 30, 2015. we are restructuring our thailand operations to focus on our competitive strengths in trucks and suvs given continued challenges in thailand and several export markets. as a result of these strategic actions related to thailand, we recorded impairment charges of $0.3 billion in automotive cost of sales in the three months ended june 30, 2015, which were treated as an adjustment for ebit-adjusted reporting purposes.
we continue to execute our plans and within the financial impact that we projected. as we continue to assess our performance throughout the region, additional restructuring and rationalization actions may be required and may have a material impact on our results of operations.
gmsa economic conditions in south america were negatively impacted by falling commodity prices and political uncertainty during 2015. as a result brazil, our largest market in south america, contracted during 2015 and continues to be negatively impacted by foreign currency deflation, high interest rates and increasing levels of unemployment. automotive industry sales in brazil decreased by 0.9 million vehicles, or 26.6%, in the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the corresponding period in 2014.
in the year ended december 31, 2015 we recorded currency devaluation charges of $0.6 billion and asset impairment charges of $0.1 billion in venezuela, which is experiencing a severe economic recession. the devaluation and asset impairment charges were recorded in automotive cost of sales and were treated as adjustments for ebit-adjusted reporting purposes. we continue to monitor developments in venezuela to assess whether market restrictions and exchange rate controls when considered with the economic and political environment in venezuela evolve such that we no longer maintain a controlling financial interest.
in the year ended december 31, 2015 we recorded a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $0.4 billion related to prepayment of unsecured debt in brazil, which is not a component of ebit-adjusted.
we continue to monitor economic conditions in south america and believe that adverse economic conditions and their effects on the automotive industry will continue in the near term. while we continue to take actions to address these challenges, no assurance can be provided that such efforts will prevent material future losses, asset impairments or other charges.

general motors company and subsidiaries in march 2015 management announced its plan to return all available free cash flow to stockholders while maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet. management's capital allocation framework includes a combined cash and marketable securities balance target of $20 billion and plans to reinvest in the business at an average target roic rate of 20% or more. in connection with this plan we announced that our board of directors had authorized a program to purchase up to $5 billion of our common stock before the end of 2016. in january 2016 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the purchase of up to an additional $4 billion of our common stock (or an aggregate total of $9 billion) before the end of 2017. at february 1, 2016 we had purchased 102 million shares of our outstanding common stock for $3.5 billion. also, in january 2016 we announced an increase of our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.38 per share effective in the first quarter of 2016.
in 2014 we created a compensation program to compensate accident victims as a result of the vehicles recalled under the ignition switch recall. in the year ended december 31, 2015 we increased our independently administered accrual for the ignition switch recall compensation program by $195 million based on the program's claims experience. the increase to the accrual was recorded in automotive selling, general and administrative expense and was treated as an adjustment for ebit-adjusted reporting purposes. total charges recorded since inception of the compensation program were $595 million at december 31, 2015. the ignition switch recall has led to various inquiries, investigations, subpoenas, requests for information and complaints from the u.s. attorney's office for the southern district of new york, congress, the sec, transport canada and 50 state attorneys general. in addition these and other recalls have resulted in a number of claims and lawsuits. we recorded charges of approximately $1.6 billion in automotive selling, general and administrative expense as a result of the dpa financial penalty and the settlements of the shareholder class action, the multidistrict litigation and other litigation associated with the recalls. these charges were treated as adjustments for ebit-adjusted reporting purposes in the year ended december 31, 2015. refer to note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. such lawsuits and investigations could in the future result in the imposition of material damages, fines, civil consent orders, civil and criminal penalties or other remedies. there can be no assurance as to how the resulting consequences, if any, may impact our business, reputation, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. the total amount accrued at december 31, 2015 represents our best estimate with regard to such claims and lawsuits. however we are currently unable to estimate either a high end of the range for these claims and lawsuits or a range of possible loss for the remaining matters because they involve significant uncertainties. the resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
in the three months ended december 31, 2015 we concluded it was more likely than not that our future earnings in certain jurisdictions in gme will be sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions so that a full valuation allowance is no longer needed. accordingly we reversed gme valuation allowances of $3.9 billion and recorded an income tax benefit. as a result we have a negative effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2015. refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the reversal of deferred tax asset valuation allowances.
based on defect information reports filed with nhtsa by takata, we are currently conducting recalls for certain takata air bag inflators used in some of our prior model year vehicles. we are continuing to assess the situation. further recalls, if any, that may be required to remediate takata air bag inflators in our vehicles could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. refer to item 1a. risk factors for additional information.
automotive financing - gm financial summary and outlook gm financial is expanding its leasing, near prime and prime lending programs in north america and anticipates that leasing and prime lending will become an increasing percentage of the originations and retail portfolio balance over time. in the year ended december 31, 2015 gm financial's revenue consisted of 46% retail finance charge income, 6% commercial finance charge income and 43% leased vehicle income. we believe that offering a comprehensive suite of financing products will generate incremental sales of our vehicles, drive incremental gm financial earnings and help support our sales throughout various economic cycles. in the year ended december 31, 2015 gm financial's retail penetration in north america grew to approximately 30%, up from approximately 10% in 2014.
on january 2, 2015 gm financial completed its acquisition of an equity interest in saic-gmac in china for $0.9 billion. as a result gm indirectly owns 45% of saic-gmac.
in february 2015 gm financial became our exclusive u.s. lease provider for buick-gmc dealers. our exclusive leasing arrangements with gm financial extended to cadillac dealers in march 2015 and to chevrolet dealers in april 2015. as a result gm financial now provides substantially all of the financing on vehicles leased by our customers. in the three months ended september 30, 2015 gm financial began accepting deposits from retail banking customers in germany.

venezuelan operations our venezuelan subsidiaries' functional currency is the u.s. dollar because of the hyperinflationary status of the venezuelan economy.
effective march 31, 2014 we changed the exchange rate for remeasuring our venezuelan subsidiaries' non-u.s. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities from the venezuela official exchange rate to the rate determined by an auction process conducted by venezuela's complementary system of foreign currency administration (sicad). the devaluation resulted in a charge of $0.4 billion recorded in automotive cost of sales in the three months ended march 31, 2014 which was treated as an adjustment for ebit-adjusted reporting purposes.
in the three months ended june 30, 2015 we changed the exchange rate for remeasuring these monetary assets and liabilities from the sicad rate to the sistema marginal de divisas (simadi) rate, which was bsf 198 to $1.00 at june 30, 2015. this devaluation resulted in a charge of $0.6 billion recorded in automotive cost of sales in the three months ended june 30, 2015 which was treated as an adjustment for ebit-adjusted reporting purposes. simadi is a third currency exchange mechanism announced by the venezuelan government in 2015. it is an open system of supply and demand expected to be limited to a small percentage of total u.s. dollar transactions using official mechanisms. we believe the simadi rate is the most representative rate to be used for remeasurement, because it is more reflective of economic reality in venezuela and future transactions, including dividends, at the sicad rate appear unlikely.
due to the adverse movements in the foreign currency exchange rate and the continued weakness in the venezuelan market we performed recoverability tests of certain assets, including our real and personal property assets, in the three months ended june 30, 2015. as a result we recorded asset impairment charges of $0.1 billion in automotive cost of sales, which were treated as an adjustment for ebit-adjusted reporting purposes.
we continued to consolidate our venezuelan subsidiaries because of recent favorable election results, settlements of new debt by the venezuelan government, participation in simadi currency exchange and vehicle production in the year ended december 31, 2015. additionally, we expect to have the ability to continue vehicle production in a limited manner during 2016 and into early 2017. absent ongoing vehicle production, our venezuelan subsidiaries may require additional financial support. at this time no decision has been made whether we will provide further financial support if required. despite the significant challenges in venezuela, this market continues to be important to us. we will continue to monitor developments in venezuela to assess whether market restrictions and exchange rate controls evolve such that we no longer maintain a controlling financial interest. if a determination is made in the future that we no longer maintain control we may incur a charge based on exchange rates at december 31, 2015 of approximately $0.2 billion.

liquidity and capital resources liquidity overview we believe that our current level of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and availability under our revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs. we expect to have substantial cash requirements going forward which we plan to fund through total available liquidity and cash flows generated from operations. we also maintain access to the capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities from time to time, which may provide an additional source of liquidity. our future uses of cash, which may vary from time to time based on market conditions and other factors, are focused on three objectives: (1) reinvest in our business; (2) maintain an investment-grade balance sheet; and (3) return cash to stockholders. our known future material uses of cash include, among other possible demands: (1) capital expenditures of approximately $9.0 billion as well as payments for engineering and product development activities; (2) payments associated with previously announced vehicle recalls, the settlements of the shareholder class action and the multidistrict litigation and any other recall-related contingencies; (3) payments to service debt and other long-term obligations, including contributions to our pension plans; (4) payments for previously announced restructuring activities; (5) dividend payments on our common stock that are declared by our board of directors; and (6) payments to purchase shares of our common stock under programs authorized by our board of directors.
our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in item 1a. risk factors, some of which are outside of our control. macroeconomic conditions could limit our ability to successfully execute our business plans and therefore adversely affect our liquidity plans and compliance with certain covenants. refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for the discussion of our financial and operational covenants.
recent management initiatives we continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities to strengthen our competitive position over the long term while maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet. these actions may include opportunistic payments to reduce our long-term obligations as well as the possibility of acquisitions, dispositions, investments with joint venture partners, and strategic alliances that we believe would generate significant advantages and substantially strengthen our business. these actions may negatively impact our liquidity in the short term.
in march 2015 management announced its plan to return all available free cash flow to stockholders while maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet. management's capital allocation framework includes a combined cash and marketable securities balance target of $20 billion and plans to reinvest in the business at an average target roic rate of 20% or more. in connection
35
general motors company and subsidiaries with this plan we announced that our board of directors had authorized a program to purchase up to $5 billion of our common stock before the end of 2016. in january 2016 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the purchase of up to an additional $4 billion of our common stock (or an aggregate total of $9 billion) before the end of 2017. also, in january 2016 we announced an increase of our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.38 per share effective in the first quarter of 2016. at february 1, 2016 we had purchased 102 million shares of our outstanding common stock for $3.5 billion.
by mid-2016 management intends to make discretionary contributions of approximately $2.0 billion to our u.s. hourly pension plan to improve its funded status. the contributions are expected to be funded by debt.
automotive available liquidity total available liquidity includes cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and funds available under credit facilities. the amount of available liquidity is subject to intra-month and seasonal fluctuations and includes balances held by various business units and subsidiaries worldwide that are needed to fund their operations.
we manage our liquidity primarily at our treasury centers as well as at certain of our significant consolidated overseas subsidiaries. approximately 90% of our available liquidity excluding funds available under credit facilities was held within north america and at our regional treasury centers at december 31, 2015. a portion of our available liquidity includes amounts deemed indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries. we have used and will continue to use other methods including intercompany loans to utilize these funds across our global operations as needed.
our cash equivalents and marketable securities balances are primarily denominated in u.s. dollars and include investments in u.s. government and agency obligations, foreign government securities, time deposits and corporate debt securities. our investment guidelines, which we may change from time to time, prescribe certain minimum credit worthiness thresholds and limit our exposures to any particular sector, asset class, issuance or security type. the majority of our current investments in debt securities are with a/a2 or better rated issuers.
we use credit facilities as a mechanism to provide additional flexibility in managing our global liquidity and to fund working capital needs at certain of our subsidiaries. the total size of our credit facilities was $12.6 billion at december 31, 2015 and 2014 which consisted principally of our two primary revolving credit facilities. we did not borrow against our primary facilities, but had amounts in use under the letter of credit sub-facility of $0.4 billion at december 31, 2015. gm financial had access to our revolving credit facilities, but did not borrow against them and we have no intercompany loans outstanding to gm financial. refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on credit facilities.

automotive financing - gm financial liquidity overview gm financial's primary sources of cash are finance charge income, leasing income, servicing fees, net distributions from securitizations, secured and unsecured debt borrowings and collections and recoveries on finance receivables. gm financial's primary uses of cash are purchases of retail finance receivables and leased vehicles, funding of commercial finance receivables, repayment of secured and unsecured debt, funding credit enhancement requirements for secured debt, operating expenses, interest costs and business acquisitions. gm financial continues to monitor and evaluate opportunities to optimize its liquidity position and the mix of its debt.
available liquidity the following table summarizes gm financial's available liquidity (dollars in billions):

in the year ended december 31, 2015 available liquidity increased due primarily to: (1) decreased usage of secured debt facilities as a result of the issuance of senior unsecured notes; and (2) decreased usage of committed unsecured lines of credit primarily due to funding provided by retail banking deposits in germany.
gm financial has the ability to borrow up to $2.0 billion against each of our three-year, $5.0 billion and five-year, $7.5 billion revolving credit facilities. in september 2014 we and gm financial entered into a support agreement which, among other things, established commitments of funding from us to gm financial. this agreement also provides that we will continue to own all of gm financial's outstanding voting shares so long as any unsecured debt securities remain outstanding at gm financial. in addition we are required to use our commercially reasonable efforts to ensure gm financial remains a subsidiary borrower under our corporate revolving credit facilities.
credit facilities in the normal course of business, in addition to using its available cash, gm financial utilizes borrowings under its credit facilities, which may be secured or unsecured, and gm financial repays these borrowings as appropriate under its cash management strategy. at december 31, 2015 secured and committed unsecured credit facilities totaled $22.4 billion and $1.5 billion, with advances outstanding of $7.5 billion and $0.6 billion.

__________
(a)   amounts include automotive interest payments based on contractual terms and current interest rates on our debt and capital lease obligations. automotive interest payments based on variable interest rates were determined using the interest rate in effect at december 31, 2015.
(b)   gm financial interest payments were determined using the interest rate in effect at december 31, 2015 for floating rate debt and the contractual rates for fixed rate debt. gm financial interest payments on floating rate tranches of the securitization notes payable were converted to a fixed rate based on the floating rate plus any expected hedge payments.
(c)   amounts include other postretirement benefits (opeb) payments under the current u.s. contractual labor agreements through 2019 and canada labor agreements through 2016. these agreements are generally renegotiated in the year of expiration. amounts do not include pension funding obligations, which are discussed in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
(d)   amounts do not include future cash payments for long-term purchase obligations and other accrued expenditures (unless specifically listed in the table above) which were recorded in accounts payable or accrued liabilities at december 31, 2015.
(e)   amounts include all expected future payments for both current and expected future service at december 31, 2015 for opeb obligations for salaried employees and hourly opeb obligations extending beyond the current north american union contract agreements. amounts do not include pension funding obligations, which are discussed in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
the table above does not reflect product warranty and related liabilities of $9.3 billion and unrecognized tax benefits of $1.4 billion due to the uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows associated with these amounts.
critical accounting estimates accounting estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements. these estimates require the use of judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented. we believe the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates.
pension and opeb plans our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, a discount rate, mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement. the expected long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the
41
general motors company and subsidiaries plans' asset mix. while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return.
in december 2015 an investment policy study was completed for the u.s. pension plans. the study resulted in new target asset allocations being approved for the u.s. pension plans with resulting changes to the expected long-term rate of return on assets. the weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets decreased from 6.4% at december 31, 2014 to 6.3% at december 31, 2015. the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for non-u.s. plans is determined in a similar manner to the u.s. plans.
another key assumption in determining net pension and opeb expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligations. we estimate the assumed discount rate for u.s. plans using a cash flow matching approach, which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate yield curve to determine the present value of cash flows. effective 2016 we will apply the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount rate to determine the service cost and interest cost. this refinement more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment. the refinement had no effect on service cost or interest cost in the year ended december 31, 2015 but will reduce the service cost and interest cost in 2016 by approximately $0.8 billion. there will be no effect on the determination of the plan obligations which will continue to be calculated using the assumed discount rate.
we have reviewed the mortality improvement tables published by the society of actuaries in the three months ended december 31, 2015 and determined our current assumptions are appropriate to measure our december 31, 2015 u.s. pension plans' benefit obligations.
significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations. the effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to expense over future periods. the unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss on our pension plans was $3.7 billion and $4.6 billion at december 31, 2015 and 2014. the change is primarily due to the increase in discount rates partially offset by actual asset returns less than assumed returns. at december 31, 2015 $2.0 billion of the unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss is outside the corridor (10% of the projected benefit obligation (pbo)) and subject to amortization. the weighted-average amortization period is approximately 12 years resulting in amortization expense of $0.2 billion in 2016.
the underfunded status of the u.s. pension plans decreased by $0.5 billion in the year ended december 31, 2015 to $10.4 billion due primarily to: (1) a favorable effect due to an increase in discount rates of $2.6 billion; (2) a favorable effect of actual returns on plan assets of $0.8 billion; and (3) favorable contributions of $0.1 billion; partially offset by (4) interest and service cost of $3.0 billion.

valuation of deferred tax assets the ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. the assessment regarding whether a valuation
42
general motors company and subsidiaries allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible sources of taxable income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors. our accounting for the valuation of deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events. changes in our current estimates, due to unanticipated market conditions or events, could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets.
at december 31, 2015 valuation allowances against deferred tax assets were $5.0 billion. refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the composition of these valuation allowances and information on the $3.9 billion income tax benefit resulting from the reversal of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in europe.
valuation of gm financial equipment on operating leases assets and residuals gm financial has investments in leased vehicles recorded as operating leases, which relate to vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms ranging from two to five years. at the beginning of the lease contract a determination is made of the estimated realizable value (i.e., residual value) of the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which is the critical assumption underlying the estimated carrying value of leased assets. the estimated realizable value is based on the lower of the contracted residual value or the current market estimate of residual value based on independent lease guides. since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, gm financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the value of the vehicle at the end of the lease term is below the residual value estimated at contract inception. over the life of the lease gm financial evaluates the adequacy of the estimate of the residual value and may make adjustments to the extent the expected value of the vehicle at lease termination changes. adjustments could result in a change in the depreciation rate of the leased asset or if an impairment exists, an impairment charge.
the following table summarizes vehicles included in gm financial equipment on operating leases, net (vehicles in thousands):
december 31, 2015         december 31, 2014
cars              271                       139

at december 31, 2015 gm financial's estimated residual value of the leased assets at the end of the lease term was $13.4 billion. the following table illustrates the effect of a 1% change in the estimated residual values at december 31, 2015, which will increase or decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of gm financial's operating leases, holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):

policy, product warranty and recall campaigns in gmna we accrue the costs for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale. in the other regions, there is not sufficient historical data to support the application of an actuarial-based estimation technique and the estimated costs will be accrued at the time when they are probable and reasonably estimable, which typically occurs once it is determined a specific recall campaign is needed and announced.
the estimates related to policy and product warranties are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events. when little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line, the estimate is based on comparable models. the estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a frequency times severity approach that considers the number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. estimates contemplate the
43
general motors company and subsidiaries nature, frequency and magnitude of historical events with consideration for changes in future expectations. costs associated with campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the per unit part and labor cost, number of units impacted and the take rate. depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. these estimates are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. revisions are made when necessary. we consider trends of claims and take action to improve vehicle quality and minimize claims.
the estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the take rate, and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. the estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience. a 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.3 billion.
actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.
sales incentives the estimated effect of sales incentives to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of automotive net sales and revenue at the later of the time of sale or announcement of an incentive program to dealers. there may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time, including a choice of incentives for a specific model. incentive programs are generally brand specific, model specific or sales region specific and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include the volume of vehicles that will be affected by the incentive programs offered by product, product mix, the rate of customer acceptance of any incentive program and the likelihood that an incentive program will be extended, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning customer behavior and future market conditions. when an incentive program is announced, the number of vehicles in dealer inventory eligible for the incentive program is determined and a reduction of automotive net sales and revenue is recorded in the period in which the program is announced. if the actual number of affected vehicles differs from this estimate, or if a different mix of incentives is actually paid, the reduction in automotive net sales and revenue incentives could be affected. there are a multitude of inputs affecting the calculation of the estimate for sales incentives and an increase or decrease of any of these variables could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives.

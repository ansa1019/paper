item 1a.   risk factors.

the following are significant risks which could have a material negative impact on the companys financial condition or results of operations.
business and industry risks commercial truck market demand is variable. the companys business is highly sensitive to global and national economic conditions as well as economic conditions in the industries and markets it serves. negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for the companys equipment and services. the yearly demand for commercial vehicles may increase or decrease more than overall gross domestic product in markets the company serves, which are principally north america and europe. demand for commercial vehicles may also be affected by the introduction of new vehicles and technologies by the company or its competitors.
competition and prices. the company operates in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect the companys sales and pricing. financial results depend largely on the ability to develop, manufacture and market competitive products that profitably meet customer demand.
production costs and supplier capacity. the companys products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs. commodity or component price increases and significant shortages of component products may adversely impact the companys financial results or use of its production capacity. many of the companys suppliers also supply automotive manufacturers, and factors that adversely affect the automotive industry can also have adverse effects on these suppliers and the company. supplier delivery performance can be adversely affected if increased demand for these suppliers products exceeds their production capacity. unexpected events, including natural disasters, may increase the companys cost of doing business or disrupt the companys or its suppliers operations.
7
liquidity risks, credit ratings and costs of funds. disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit the companys sources of liquidity, or the liquidity of customers, dealers and suppliers. a lowering of the companys credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowing and adversely affect access to capital markets. the companys financial services segment obtains funds for its operations from commercial paper, medium-term notes and bank debt. if the markets for commercial paper, medium-term notes and bank debt do not provide the necessary liquidity in the future, the financial services segment may experience increased costs or may have to limit its financing of retail and wholesale assets. this could result in a reduction of the number of vehicles the company is able to produce and sell to customers.
the financial services industry is highly competitive. the companys financial services segment competes with banks, other commercial finance companies and financial services firms which may have lower costs of borrowing, higher leverage or market share goals that result in a willingness to offer lower interest rates, which may lead to decreased margins, lower market share or both. a decline in the companys truck unit sales and a decrease in truck residual values due to lower used truck pricing are also factors which may affect the companys financial services segment.
the financial services segment is subject to credit risk. the financial services segment is exposed to the risk of loss arising from the failure of a customer, dealer or counterparty to meet the terms of the loans, leases and derivative contracts with the company. although the financial assets of the financial services segment are secured by underlying equipment collateral, in the event a customer cannot meet its obligations to the company, there is a risk that the value of the underlying collateral will not be sufficient to recover the amounts owed to the company, resulting in credit losses.
interest-rate risks. the financial services segment is subject to interest-rate risks, because increases in interest rates can reduce demand for its products, increase borrowing costs and potentially reduce interest margins. pfs uses derivative contracts to match the interest rate characteristics of its debt to the interest rate characteristics of its finance receivables in order to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates.
product liability, litigation and regulatory actions. the companys products are subject to recall for environmental, performance and safety-related issues. product recalls, lawsuits, regulatory actions or increases in the reserves the company establishes for contingencies may increase the companys costs and lower profits. refer to item 3  legal proceedings for a discussion of the risk associated with the european commission investigation. the companys reputation and its brand names are valuable assets, and claims or regulatory actions, even if unsuccessful or without merit, could adversely affect the companys reputation and brand images because of adverse publicity.
information technology. the company relies on information technology systems, including the internet and other computer systems, which may be subject to disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components; power outages; hardware failures; computer viruses; or outside parties attempting to disrupt the companys business or gain unauthorized access to the companys electronic data. the company maintains protections to guard against such events. if the companys computer systems were to be damaged, disrupted or breached, it could result in a negative impact on the companys operating results and could also cause reputational damage, business disruption or the disclosure of confidential data.
political, regulatory and economic risks multinational operations. the companys global operations are exposed to political, economic and other risks and events beyond its control in the countries in which the company operates. the company may be adversely affected by political instabilities, fuel shortages or interruptions in utility or transportation systems, natural calamities, wars, terrorism and labor strikes. changes in government monetary or fiscal policies and international trade policies may impact demand for the companys products, financial results and competitive position. paccars global operations are subject to extensive trade, competition and anti-corruption laws and regulations that could impose significant compliance costs.
environmental regulations. the companys operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs. the company could experience higher research and development costs due to changes in government requirements for its products, including changes in emissions, fuel, greenhouse gas or other regulations.
8
currency exchange and translation. the companys consolidated financial results are reported in u.s. dollars, while significant operations are denominated in the currencies of other countries. currency exchange rate fluctuations can affect the companys assets, liabilities and results of operations through both translation and transaction risk, as reported in the companys financial statements. the company uses certain derivative financial instruments and localized production of its products to reduce, but not eliminate, the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
accounting estimates. in the preparation of the companys financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented. certain of these estimates, judgments and assumptions, such as residual values on operating leases, the allowance for credit losses, warranty and pension expenses and the provision for income taxes, are particularly sensitive. if actual results are different from estimates used by management, they may have a material impact on the financial statements. for additional disclosures regarding accounting estimates, see critical accounting policies under item 7 of this form 10-k.
taxes. changes in statutory income tax rates in the countries in which the company operates impact the companys effective tax rate. changes to other taxes or the adoption of other new tax legislation could affect the companys provision for income taxes and related tax assets and liabilities.
item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.

overview:
paccar is a global technology company whose truck segment includes the design and manufacture of high-quality, light-, medium- and heavy-duty commercial trucks. in north america, trucks are sold under the kenworth and peterbilt nameplates, in europe, under the daf nameplate and in australia and south america, under the kenworth and daf nameplates. the parts segment includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles. the companys financial services segment derives its earnings primarily from financing or leasing paccar products in north america, europe and australia. the companys other business includes the manufacturing and marketing of industrial winches.
consolidated net sales and revenues of $19.12 billion in 2015 were the highest in the companys history. the increase from $18.99 billion in 2014 was primarily due to stronger industry truck sales in the u.s. and europe, partially offset by the effects of translating weaker foreign currencies, primarily the euro, to the u.s. dollar.
in 2015, paccar earned net income for the 77th consecutive year. net income in 2015 of $1.60 billion was the highest in the companys history, increasing from $1.36 billion in 2014. the results reflect increased truck sales in the u.s. and europe and strong aftermarket parts and financial services results. the u.s. truck market benefited from record freight demand and expansion of industry fleet capacity. earnings per diluted share were $4.51 compared to $3.82 in 2014.
the company is expanding its range of paccar engines in north america with the introduction of the paccar mx-11 engine, with an output of up to 430 hp and 1,550 lb.-ft. of torque. the paccar mx-11 is scheduled to be available in kenworth and peterbilt trucks in early 2016. the paccar mx-11 engine is designed to deliver excellent performance and fuel economy, industry-leading durability and reliability, and a quiet operating environment for the driver.
kenworth and peterbilt launched new vehicle technologies that provide customers real-time diagnostic information to enhance their vehicle operating performance. kenworth trucktech+ and peterbilt smartlinq diagnostic systems are in production on new class 8 trucks equipped with the paccar mx-13 engine. in addition, predictive cruise control is in production for kenworth t680 and t660 trucks and peterbilt model 579 and model 567 trucks, specified with the paccar mx-13 engine. the new driver assist systems integrate cruise control with global positioning system data to anticipate road contours, enabling the paccar mx-13 engine to achieve outstanding fuel economy.
kenworth and peterbilt have developed additional technologies to enhance customers driver performance and profitability. driver performance assistant and driver shift aid are standard equipment on kenworth t680 and t660 trucks and peterbilt model 579 and model 567 trucks, specified with the paccar mx-13 engine. driver performance assistant provides drivers with real-time coaching on driving behavior and a scoring system to optimize driver performance and fuel economy. driver shift aid provides drivers in vehicles with manual transmissions a visual cue to shift at the optimal rpm and engine torque to maximize fuel economy.
daf introduced the new lf 2016 edition which features enhancements to the paccar px-5 4.5 liter engine, resulting in up to 5% better fuel efficiency. in addition, a new daf aerodynamic package results in 4% better fuel efficiency, while advanced technologies such as lane departure warning system, advanced emergency braking system, forward collision warning and adaptive cruise control enhance comfort and safety.
paccar parts added 18 dealer-owned trp stores in 2015, building on the success of paccar parts trp brand of aftermarket parts for all makes of medium- and heavy-duty trucks, trailers and buses. trp stores are strategically located to bring trp products and technical expertise close to the customer. paccars new 160,000 square-foot distribution center in renton, washington is under construction and is expected to open in the second quarter of 2016.
the paccar financial services (pfs) group of companies has operations covering four continents and 22 countries. the global breadth of pfs and its rigorous credit application process support a portfolio of loans and leases with total assets of $12.25 billion that earned pre-tax profit of $362.6 million. pfs issued $1.92 billion in medium-term notes during the year to support portfolio growth.

in 2015, the companys capital investments were $308.4 million compared to $223.1 million in 2014, and research and development (r&d) expenses were $239.8 million in 2015 compared to $215.6 million in 2014.
truck outlook truck industry retail sales in the u.s. and canada in 2016 are expected to be 230,000 to 260,000 units compared to 278,400 in 2015. in europe, the 2016 truck industry registrations for over 16-tonne vehicles are projected to increase to a range of 260,000 to 290,000 units, compared to the 269,100 truck registrations in 2015. in south america, heavy-duty truck industry sales were 74,000 units in 2015, and the 2016 heavy-duty truck industry sales are estimated to be in a range of 70,000 to 80,000 units.
parts outlook in 2016, paccar parts sales in north america are expected to increase 3-5%, reflecting steady economic growth and high fleet utilization. in 2016, europe aftermarket sales are expected to increase 3-5%, reflecting good freight markets and paccar parts innovative customer service programs. the u.s. dollar value of sales in europe may continue to be affected by recent declines in the value of the euro relative to the u.s. dollar.
financial services outlook based on the truck market outlook, average earning assets in 2016 are expected to be comparable to the record levels achieved in 2015. current strong levels of freight tonnage, freight rates and fleet utilization are contributing to customers profitability and cash flow. if current freight transportation conditions decline due to weaker economic conditions, then past due accounts, truck repossessions and credit losses would likely increase from the current low levels and new business volumes would likely decline.
capital spending and r&d outlook capital investments in 2016 are expected to be $325 to $375 million, and r&d is expected to be $240 to $270 million focused on enhanced aftermarket support, manufacturing facilities and new product development.
see the forward-looking statements section of managements discussion and analysis for factors that may affect these outlooks.

the companys worldwide truck net sales and revenues increased to $14.78 billion from $14.59 billion in 2014, primarily due to higher truck deliveries in the u.s and europe. the effects of translating weaker foreign currencies to the u.s. dollar, primarily the euro, reduced 2015 worldwide truck net sales and revenues by $940.0 million.
truck segment income before income taxes and pre-tax return on revenues reflect higher truck unit deliveries and improved gross margins in the u.s. and europe. the effects on income before income taxes of translating weaker foreign currencies to the u.s. dollar, primarily the euro, were largely offset by lower costs of north american mx engine components imported from europe.

truck delivery volume reflects higher truck deliveries in the u.s. and canada and europe which resulted in higher sales ($1,413.2 million) and cost of sales ($1,113.6 million), partially offset by lower truck deliveries in mexico and australia which resulted in lower sales ($288.2 million) and costs of sales ($233.1 million).
 average truck sales prices increased sales by $78.2 million, primarily due to improved price realization in europe.  average cost per truck decreased cost of sales by $107.7 million, primarily due to lower material costs, reflecting lower commodity prices and lower costs of north american mx engine components imported from europe which benefited from the decline in the value of the euro.
 factory overhead and other indirect costs increased $29.6 million, primarily due to higher supplies and maintenance costs ($31.1 million).  operating lease revenues decreased by $80.8 million and cost of sales decreased by $75.6 million due to lower average asset balances.
 the currency translation effect on sales and cost of sales reflects a decline in the value of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, primarily the euro.
 truck gross margins in 2015 of 12.2% increased from 10.2% in 2014 due to the factors noted above.
truck selling, general and administrative expenses (sg&a) for 2015 decreased to $192.6 million from $198.2 million in 2014. the decrease was primarily due to currency translation effect ($21.8 million), mostly related to a decline in the value of the euro relative

the companys worldwide parts net sales and revenues were $3.06 billion in 2015 compared to $3.08 billion in 2014.
higher aftermarket demand in north america and europe was offset by a decline in the value of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, primarily the euro, which reduced 2015 worldwide parts net sales and revenues by $193.3 million.
the increase in parts segment income before income taxes and pre-tax return on revenues in 2015 was primarily due to higher sales and gross margins. this was partially offset by a decline in the value of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, primarily the euro, which reduced 2015 parts segment income before income taxes by $34.1 million. the major factors for the changes in net sales and revenues, cost of sales and revenues and gross margin between 2015 and 2014 for the parts segment are as follows:

   a higher volume of used truck sales increased operating lease, rental and other revenues by $9.5 million and increased depreciation and other expenses by $11.9 million.

   results on returned lease assets increased depreciation and other expenses by $7.7 million, primarily due to lower gains on sales of returned lease units.

   average operating lease assets increased $188.2 million in 2015 (excluding foreign exchange effects), which increased revenues by $17.3 million and related depreciation and other expenses by $13.6 million.

   revenue per asset increased $8.1 million primarily due to higher fee income and higher rental rates, partially offset by lower fuel revenue. cost per asset increased $4.6 million, primarily due to higher depreciation expense, partially offset by lower fuel expense.

   the currency translation effects reflect a decline in the value of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, primarily the euro.

the provision for losses on receivables was $12.4 million in 2015, a decrease of $3.0 million compared to 2014, mainly due to improved portfolio performance in europe and the effects of translating weaker foreign currencies to the u.s. dollar, partially offset by higher portfolio balances in europe and the u.s. and canada.
the company modifies loans and finance leases as a normal part of its financial services operations. the company may modify loans and finance leases for commercial reasons or for credit reasons. modifications for commercial reasons are changes to contract terms for customers that are not considered to be in financial difficulty. insignificant delays are modifications extending terms up to three months for customers experiencing some short-term financial stress, but not considered to be in financial difficulty. modifications for credit reasons are changes to contract terms for customers considered to be in financial difficulty. the companys modifications typically result in granting more time to pay the contractual amounts owed and charging a fee and interest for the term of the modification. when considering whether to modify customer accounts for credit reasons, the company evaluates the creditworthiness of the customers and modifies those accounts that the company considers likely to perform under the modified terms. when the company modifies loans and finance leases for credit reasons and grants a concession, the modifications are classified as troubled debt restructurings (tdr).

in 2015, total modification activity increased compared to 2014, primarily due to higher modifications for credit - tdrs, partially offset by the effects of translating weaker foreign currencies to the u.s. dollar and lower commercial modifications. tdr modifications increased primarily due to contract modifications in mexico. the decrease in commercial modifications reflects lower volumes of refinancing.

accounts 30+ days past due were .5% at december 31, 2015 and 2014, as higher past due accounts in the u.s.
and canada were offset by lower past dues in all other markets. the company continues to focus on maintaining low past due balances.
when the company modifies a 30+ days past due account, the customer is then generally considered current under the revised contractual terms. the company modified $2.6 million of accounts worldwide during the fourth quarter of 2015 and $4.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2014 that were 30+ days past due and became current at the time of modification. had these accounts not been modified and continued to not make payments, the pro forma percentage of retail loan and lease accounts 30+ days past due would have been as follows:

other other includes the winch business as well as sales, income and expenses not attributable to a reportable segment, including a portion of corporate expense. other sales represents less than 1% of consolidated net sales and revenues for 2015 and 2014. other sg&a was $58.7 million in 2015 and $59.5 million in 2014. the decrease in sg&a was primarily due to lower salaries and related expenses. other income (loss) before tax was a loss of $43.2 million in 2015 compared to a loss of $31.9 million in 2014. the higher loss in 2015 was primarily due to lower income before tax from the winch business which has been affected by lower oilfield related business.
investment income was $21.8 million in 2015 compared to $22.3 million in 2014. the lower investment income in 2015 was primarily due to the effects of translating weaker foreign currencies to the u.s. dollar, partially offset by higher realized gains and average portfolio balances.
income taxes the 2015 effective income tax rate of 31.4% decreased from 32.7% in 2014. the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in research tax credits in 2015.

the provision for losses on receivables was $15.4
million in 2014, an increase of $2.5 million compared to 2013, mainly due to a higher portfolio balance in the u.s., higher past dues resulting from a weaker mining industry in australia, partially offset by improved portfolio performance across other markets. the company modifies loans and finance leases as a normal part of its financial services operations. the company may modify loans and finance leases for commercial reasons or for credit reasons. modifications for commercial reasons are changes to contract terms for customers that are not considered to be in financial difficulty. insignificant delays are modifications extending terms up to three months for customers experiencing some short-term financial stress, but not considered to be in financial difficulty. modifications for credit reasons are changes to contract terms for customers considered to be in financial difficulty. the companys modifications typically result in granting more time to pay the contractual amounts owed and charging a fee and interest for the term of the modification. when considering whether to modify customer accounts for credit reasons, the company evaluates the creditworthiness of the customers and modifies those accounts that the company considers likely to perform under the modified terms.
when the company modifies loans and finance leases for credit reasons and grants a concession, the modifications are classified as troubled debt restructurings (tdr).
the post-modification balances of accounts modified during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 are summarized below:

in 2014, total modification activity decreased compared to 2013 primarily due to lower modifications for commercial reasons and insignificant delays, partially offset by an increase in tdr modifications. the decrease in commercial modifications primarily reflects lower levels of additional equipment financed and end-of-contract modifications. the decline in modifications for insignificant delays reflects 2013 extensions granted to two customers in australia primarily due to business disruptions arising from flooding. tdr modifications increased primarily due to a contract modification for a large customer in the u.s.

accounts 30+ days past due were .5% at december 31, 2014 and 2013. the higher past dues in europe, mexico and australia were offset by lower past dues in the u.s. and canada. the company continues to focus on maintaining low past due balances.
when the company modifies a 30+ days past due account, the customer is then generally considered current under the revised contractual terms. the company modified $4.0 million of accounts worldwide during the fourth quarter of 2014 and $4.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2013 that were
30+ days past due and became current at the time of modification. had these accounts not been modified and continued to not make payments, the pro forma percentage of retail loan and lease accounts 30+ days past due would have been as follows:

modifications of accounts in prior quarters that were more than 30 days past due at the time of modification are included in past dues if they were not performing under the modified terms at december 31, 2014 and 2013. the effect on the allowance for credit losses from such modifications was not significant at december 31, 2014 and 2013.
the companys 2014 and 2013 pre-tax return on average earning assets for financial services was 3.3% and 3.2%, respectively.
other other includes the winch business as well as sales, income and expenses not attributable to a reportable segment, including a portion of corporate expense. other sales represent approximately 1% of consolidated net sales and revenues for 2014 and 2013. other sg&a was $59.5 million in 2014 and $47.1 million in 2013. the increase in sg&a was primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses of $11.4 million. other income (loss) before tax was a loss of $31.9 million in 2014 compared to a loss of $26.5 million in 2013. the higher loss in 2014 was primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses and lower income before tax from the winch business.
investment income was $22.3 million in 2014 compared to $28.6 million in 2013. the lower investment income in 2014 primarily reflects lower yields on investments due to lower market interest rates, partially offset by higher average investment balances.

income taxes the 2014 effective income tax rate of 32.7% increased from 30.9% in 2013. the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a higher proportion of income generated in higher taxed jurisdictions.

the higher income before income taxes and return on revenues for domestic operations were primarily due to higher revenues from trucks and parts operations and higher truck margins. the lower income before income taxes and pre-tax return on revenues for foreign operations were primarily due to lower revenues and truck margins in all foreign markets, except canada. liquidity and capital resources:

2015 compared to 2014:
operating activities: cash provided by operations increased $432.4 million to $2.56 billion in 2015 compared to $2.12 billion in 2014. higher operating cash flow reflects $245.2 million of higher net income and $253.8 million from inventory as there was $64.3 million in net inventory reductions in 2015 vs. $189.5 million in net inventory purchases in 2014. in addition, higher cash inflows reflects $176.6 million from accounts receivables as collections exceeded sales in 2015 ($105.3 million) compared to sales exceeding collections in 2014 ($71.3 million). a lower increase in financial services sales-type finance leases and dealer direct loans on new trucks also contributed $126.5 million. these cash inflows were partially offset by cash outflows of $414.9 million from accounts payable and accrued expenses, where payments from goods and services exceeded purchases in 2015 ($162.6 million) compared to purchases exceeding payments in 2014 ($252.3 million).
29
investing activities: cash used in investing activities of $1.97 billion in 2015 increased $443.0 million from the $1.53 billion used in 2014, primarily due to higher cash used in the acquisitions of equipment for operating leases of $199.4 million, $169.7 million higher net purchases of marketable securities and $116.0 million in higher net originations of retail loans and direct financing leases in 2015. these outflows were partially offset by higher proceeds from asset disposals of $53.3 million.
financing activities: cash used in financing activities was $196.5 million in 2015 compared to $520.5 million in 2014. the company paid $680.5 million of dividends in 2015 compared to $623.8 million paid in 2014, an increase of $56.7 million. in addition, the company repurchased 3.8 million shares of common stock for $201.6 million in 2015 compared to .7 million shares for $42.7 million in 2014. in 2015, the company issued $1.99 billion of term debt and $250.7 million of commercial paper and short-term bank loans and repaid maturing term debt of $1.58 billion. in 2014, the company issued $1.65 billion of term debt and $349.1 million of commercial paper and short-term bank loans and repaid maturing term debt of $1.88 billion. this resulted in cash provided by borrowing activities of $663.8 million in 2015, $546.9 million higher than cash provided by borrowing activities of $116.9 million in 2014.
2014 compared to 2013:
operating activities: cash provided by operations decreased $252.1 million to $2.12 billion in 2014 compared to $2.38 billion in 2013. lower operating cash flow reflects a higher increase in financial services segment wholesale receivables of $150.3 million and a higher increase in net purchases of inventories of $149.9 million. in addition, lower cash inflows resulted from a reduction in liabilities for residual value guarantees (rvg) and deferred revenues of $138.7 million, primarily due to a lower volume of new rvg contracts compared to 2013, and $54.9 million in higher pension contributions. these outflows were partially offset by $187.5 million of higher net income and $74.5 million of higher depreciation on property, plant and equipment.
investing activities: cash used in investing activities of $1.53 billion in 2014 decreased $619.1 million from the $2.15 billion used in 2013, primarily due to lower net new loan and lease originations of $257.0 million, lower payments for property, plant and equipment of $212.4 million and lower cash used in the acquisitions of equipment for operating leases of $123.1 million.
financing activities: cash used in financing activities was $520.5 million for 2014 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $273.8 million in 2013. the company paid $623.8 million of dividends in 2014 compared to $283.1 million paid in 2013, an increase of $340.7 million. the higher dividends in 2014 reflect a special dividend declared in 2013 and paid in early 2014. in 2013, there was no special dividend payment, as the 2012 special dividend was declared and paid in 2012. the company also repurchased .7 million shares of common stock for $42.7 million in 2014. in 2014, the company issued $1.65 billion in term debt and $349.1 million of commercial paper and short-term bank loans and repaid term debt of $1.88 billion. in 2013, the company issued $2.13 billion in term debt and repaid term debt of $568.9 million and reduced its outstanding commercial paper and bank loans by $1.04 billion. this resulted in cash provided by borrowing activities of $116.9 million, $409.0 million lower than cash provided by borrowing activities of $525.9 million in 2013.
credit lines and other:
the company has line of credit arrangements of $3.43 billion, of which $3.26 billion were unused at december 31, 2015. included in these arrangements are $3.0 billion of syndicated bank facilities, of which $1.0 billion expires in june 2016, $1.0 billion expires in june 2019 and $1.0 billion expires in june 2020. the company intends to replace these credit facilities on or before expiration with facilities of similar amounts and duration. these credit facilities are maintained primarily to provide backup liquidity for commercial paper borrowings and maturing medium-term notes. there were no borrowings under the syndicated bank facilities for the year ended december 31, 2015.
on september 21, 2015, the company completed the repurchase of $300.0 million of the companys common stock under authorizations approved in december 2011. on september 23, 2015, paccars board of directors approved the repurchase of an additional $300.0 million of the companys common stock, and as of december 31, 2015, $136.3 million of shares have been repurchased pursuant to the 2015 authorization.
at december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, the company had cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt securities of $1.82 billion and $1.60 billion, respectively, which are considered indefinitely reinvested in foreign subsidiaries. the company

periodically repatriates foreign earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested. dividends paid by foreign subsidiaries to the u.s. parent were $.24 billion, $.24 billion and $.19 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the company believes that its u.s. cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt securities, future operating cash flow and access to the capital markets, along with periodic repatriation of foreign earnings, will be sufficient to meet u.s. liquidity requirements.
truck, parts and other the company provides funding for working capital, capital expenditures, r&d, dividends, stock repurchases and other business initiatives and commitments primarily from cash provided by operations. management expects this method of funding to continue in the future.
investments for property, plant and equipment in 2015 increased to $306.5 million from $220.8 million in 2014, primarily due to higher investments by daf in europe and the construction of a new parts distribution center in renton, washington. over the past decade, the companys combined investments in worldwide capital projects and r&d totaled $5.92 billion, which have significantly increased the operating capacity and efficiency of its facilities and the competitive advantage of the companys premium products.
in 2016, capital investments are expected to be $325 to $375 million, and r&d is expected to be $240 to $270 million focused on enhanced aftermarket support, manufacturing facilities and new product development.
the company conducts business in spain, italy, portugal, ireland, greece, russia, ukraine and certain other countries which have been experiencing significant financial stress, fiscal or political strain and the corresponding potential default. the company routinely monitors its financial exposure to global financial conditions, global counterparties and operating environments. as of december 31, 2015, the company had finance and trade receivables in these countries of approximately 1% of consolidated total assets. in addition, the companys exposures in these countries were insignificant for both derivative counterparty credit and marketable debt security investments in corporate or sovereign government securities as of december 31, 2015.
financial services the company funds its financial services activities primarily from collections on existing finance receivables and borrowings in the capital markets. the primary sources of borrowings in the capital markets are commercial paper and medium-term notes issued in the public markets and, to a lesser extent, bank loans. an additional source of funds is loans from other paccar companies.
the company issues commercial paper for a portion of its funding in its financial services segment. some of this commercial paper is converted to fixed interest rate debt through the use of interest-rate swaps, which are used to manage interest-rate risk.
in november 2015, the companys u.s. finance subsidiary, paccar financial corp. (pfc), filed a shelf registration under the securities act of 1933. the total amount of medium-term notes outstanding for pfc as of december 31, 2015 was $4.40 billion. the registration expires in november 2018 and does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued during that period.
as of december 31, 2015, the companys european finance subsidiary, paccar financial europe, had 269.0 million available for issuance under a 1.50 billion medium-term note program listed on the professional securities market of the london stock exchange. this program replaced an expiring program in the second quarter of 2015 and is renewable annually through the filing of new listing particulars.
in april 2011, paccar financial mexico (pfm) registered a 10.00 billion peso medium-term note and commercial paper program with the comision nacional bancaria y de valores. the registration expires in april 2016 and limits the amount of commercial paper (up to one year) to 5.00 billion pesos. at december 31, 2015, 8.04 billion pesos remained available for issuance. pfm intends to file a new program in april 2016.
in the event of a future significant disruption in the financial markets, the company may not be able to issue replacement commercial paper. as a result, the company is exposed to liquidity risk from the shorter maturity of short-term borrowings paid to lenders compared to the longer timing of receivable collections from customers. the company believes its cash balances and investments, collections on existing finance receivables, syndicated bank lines and current investment-grade credit ratings of a+/a1 will continue

to provide it with sufficient resources and access to capital markets at competitive interest rates and therefore contribute to the company maintaining its liquidity and financial stability. a decrease in these credit ratings could negatively impact the companys ability to access capital markets at competitive interest rates and the companys ability to maintain liquidity and financial stability. paccar believes its financial services companies will be able to continue funding receivables, servicing debt and paying dividends through internally generated funds, access to public and private debt markets and lines of credit.

loan and lease commitments are for funding new retail loan and lease contracts. residual value guarantees represent the companys commitment to acquire trucks at a guaranteed value if the customer decides to return the truck at a specified date in the future.
impact of environmental matters:
the company, its competitors and industry in general are subject to various domestic and foreign requirements relating to the environment. the company believes its policies, practices and procedures are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that its handling, use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances have been in accordance with environmental laws and regulations in effect at the time such use and disposal occurred.
the company is involved in various stages of investigations and cleanup actions in different countries related to environmental matters. in certain of these matters, the company has been designated as a potentially responsible party by domestic and foreign environmental agencies. the company has accrued the estimated costs to investigate and complete cleanup actions where it is probable that the company will incur such costs in the future. expenditures related to environmental activities in the years ended
32
december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $2.0 million, $1.2 million and $2.3 million, respectively. management expects that these matters will not have a significant effect on the companys consolidated cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.
critical accounting policies:
the companys significant accounting policies are disclosed in note a of the consolidated financial statements. in the preparation of the companys financial statements, in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented. the following are accounting policies which, in the opinion of management, are particularly sensitive and which, if actual results are different from estimates used by management, may have a material impact on the financial statements.
operating leases trucks sold pursuant to agreements accounted for as operating leases are disclosed in note e of the consolidated financial statements. in determining its estimate of the residual value of such vehicles, the company considers the length of the lease term, the truck model, the expected usage of the truck and anticipated market demand. operating lease terms generally range from three to five years. the resulting residual values on operating leases generally range between 30% and 50% of original equipment cost. if the sales price of the trucks at the end of the term of the agreement differs from the companys estimated residual value, a gain or loss will result.
future market conditions, changes in government regulations and other factors outside the companys control could impact the ultimate sales price of trucks returned under these contracts. residual values are reviewed regularly and adjusted if market conditions warrant. a decrease in the estimated equipment residual values would increase annual depreciation expense over the remaining lease term.
during 2015, 2014 and 2013, market values on equipment returning upon operating lease maturity were generally higher than the residual values on the equipment, resulting in a decrease in depreciation expense of $5.8 million, $10.6 million and $4.4 million, respectively.
at december 31, 2015, the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases in the financial services segment and residual value guarantee on trucks accounted for as operating leases in the truck segment was $2.10 billion. a 10% decrease in used truck values worldwide, expected to persist over the remaining maturities of the companys operating leases, would reduce residual value estimates and result in the company recording an average of approximately $52.6 million of additional depreciation per year.
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses related to the companys loans and finance leases is disclosed in note d of the consolidated financial statements. the company has developed a systematic methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses for its two portfolio segments, retail and wholesale. the retail segment consists of retail loans and direct and sales-type finance leases, net of unearned interest. the wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing loans to dealers that are collateralized by trucks and other collateral. the wholesale segment generally has less risk than the retail segment. wholesale receivables generally are shorter in duration than retail receivables, and the company requires periodic reporting of the wholesale dealers financial condition, conducts periodic audits of the trucks being financed and in many cases, obtains guarantees or other security such as dealership assets. in determining the allowance for credit losses, retail loans and finance leases are evaluated together since they relate to a similar customer base, their contractual terms require regular payment of principal and interest, generally over 36 to 60 months, and they are secured by the same type of collateral. the allowance for credit losses consists of both specific and general reserves.
the company individually evaluates certain finance receivables for impairment. finance receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment consist of all wholesale accounts and certain large retail accounts with past due balances or otherwise determined to be at a higher risk of loss. a finance receivable is impaired if it is considered probable the company will be unable to collect all contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled. in addition, all retail loans and leases which have been classified as tdrs and all customer accounts over 90 days past due are considered impaired. generally, impaired accounts are on non-accrual status. impaired accounts classified as tdrs which have been performing for 90 consecutive days are placed on accrual status if it is deemed probable that the company will collect all principal and interest payments.
33
impaired receivables are generally considered collateral dependent. large balance retail and all wholesale impaired receivables are individually evaluated to determine the appropriate reserve for losses. the determination of reserves for large balance impaired receivables considers the fair value of the associated collateral. when the underlying collateral fair value exceeds the companys recorded investment, no reserve is recorded. small balance impaired receivables with similar risk characteristics are evaluated as a separate pool to determine the appropriate reserve for losses using the historical loss information discussed below.
the company evaluates finance receivables that are not individually impaired on a collective basis and determines the general allowance for credit losses for both retail and wholesale receivables based on historical loss information, using past due account data and current market conditions. information used includes assumptions regarding the likelihood of collecting current and past due accounts, repossession rates, the recovery rate on the underlying collateral based on used truck values and other pledged collateral or recourse. the company has developed a range of loss estimates for each of its country portfolios based on historical experience, taking into account loss frequency and severity in both strong and weak truck market conditions. a projection is made of the range of estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio from which an amount is determined as probable based on current market conditions and other factors impacting the creditworthiness of the companys borrowers and their ability to repay. after determining the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses, a provision for losses on finance receivables is charged to income as necessary to reflect managements estimate of incurred credit losses, net of recoveries, inherent in the portfolio.
the adequacy of the allowance is evaluated quarterly based on the most recent past due account information and current market conditions. as accounts become past due, the likelihood that they will not be fully collected increases. the companys experience indicates the probability of not fully collecting past due accounts ranges between 20% and 70%. over the past three years, the companys year-end 30+ days past due accounts were .5% of loan and lease receivables. historically, a 100 basis point increase in the 30+ days past due percentage has resulted in an increase in credit losses of 5 to 30 basis points of receivables. at december 31, 2015, 30+ days past dues were .5%. if past dues were 100 basis points higher or 1.5% as of december 31, 2015, the companys estimate of credit losses would likely have increased by a range of $5 to $25 million depending on the extent of the past dues, the estimated value of the collateral as compared to amounts owed and general economic factors.
product warranty product warranty is disclosed in note h of the consolidated financial statements. the expenses related to product warranty are estimated and recorded at the time products are sold based on historical and current data and reasonable expectations for the future regarding the frequency and cost of warranty claims, net of recoveries. management takes actions to minimize warranty costs through quality-improvement programs; however, actual claim costs incurred could materially differ from the estimated amounts and require adjustments to the reserve. historically those adjustments have not been material. over the past three years, warranty expense as a percentage of truck, parts and other net sales and revenues has ranged between 1.4% and 1.8%. if the 2015 warranty expense had been .2% higher as a percentage of net sales and revenues in 2015, warranty expense would have increased by approximately $36 million.
pension benefits employee benefits are disclosed in note l of the consolidated financial statements. the companys accounting for employee pension benefit costs and obligations is based on management assumptions about the future used by actuaries to estimate net costs and liabilities. these assumptions include discount rates, long-term rates of return on plan assets, inflation rates, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. management bases these assumptions on historical results, the current environment and reasonable estimates of future events.
the discount rate for pension benefits is based on market interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds with a maturity profile that matches the timing of the projected benefit payments of the plans. changes in the discount rate affect the valuation of the plan benefits obligation and funded status of the plans. the long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on projected returns for each asset class and relative weighting of those asset classes in the plans.
because differences between actual results and the assumptions for returns on plan assets, retirement rates and mortality rates are accumulated and amortized into expense over future periods, management does not believe these differences or a typical percentage change in these assumptions worldwide would have a material effect on its financial results in the next year. the most significant assumption which could negatively affect pension expense is a decrease in the discount rate. if the discount rate were to decrease .5%,
34
2015 net pension expense would increase to $107.6 million from $85.0 million and the projected benefit obligation would increase $207.2 million to $2.5 billion from $2.3 billion.
income taxes income taxes are disclosed in note m of the consolidated financial statements. the company calculates income tax expense on pre-tax income based on current tax law. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for future tax consequences on temporary differences between recorded amounts in the financial statements and their respective tax basis. the determination of income tax expense requires management estimates and involves judgment regarding indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings, jurisdictional mix of earnings and future outcomes regarding tax law issues included in tax returns. the company updates its assumptions on all of these factors each quarter as well as new information on tax laws and differences between estimated taxes and actual returns when filed. if the companys assessment of these matters changes, the effect is accounted for in earnings in the period the change is made.
forward-looking statements:
this report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. forward-looking statements include statements relating to future results of operations or financial position and any other statement that does not relate to any historical or current fact. such statements are based on currently available operating, financial and other information and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may affect actual results. risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: a significant decline in industry sales; competitive pressures; reduced market share; reduced availability of or higher prices for fuel; increased safety, emissions, or other regulations resulting in higher costs and/or sales restrictions; currency or commodity price fluctuations; lower used truck prices; insufficient or under-utilization of manufacturing capacity; supplier interruptions; insufficient liquidity in the capital markets; fluctuations in interest rates; changes in the levels of the financial services segment new business volume due to unit fluctuations in new paccar truck sales or reduced market shares; changes affecting the profitability of truck owners and operators; price changes impacting truck sales prices and residual values; insufficient supplier capacity or access to raw materials; labor disruptions; shortages of commercial truck drivers; increased warranty costs or litigation; or legislative and governmental regulations. a more detailed description of these and other risks is included under the heading part 1, item 1a, risk factors in the companys annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2015.

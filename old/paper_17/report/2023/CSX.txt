item 1a.  risk factors the risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the company's forward-looking statements. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the company or that the company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
regulatory, legislative and legal new legislation, regulatory changes or other governmental actions could impact the company's earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices.
legislation passed by congress, new regulations issued by federal agencies, or executive orders issued by the president of the united states could significantly affect the revenues, costs, including income taxes, and profitability of the company's business. in addition, statutes or regulations that, among other things, impose price constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the company's profitability.
government regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the company's operations and financial results.
the company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including the stb, fra, phmsa, tsa, epa and other state, provincial, local and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal, cybersecurity and other matters. new or modified rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the company's operating costs, adversely impact revenue or reduce operating efficiencies and affect service performance. noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the company and can subject the company to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions.
csxt, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials and could be adversely impacted by non-compliance with applicable regulations or from regulatory and legislative changes.
csxt is required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials and has a legal obligation to transport certain hazardous materials under the common carrier mandate. applicable rules issued by the tsa place significant security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail. noncompliance with these rules can subject the company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident. finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances, which could increase operating costs, reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials.

csx corporation part i the company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.
as part of its railroad and other operations, the company is subject to various claims and lawsuits related to disputes over commercial practices, labor and unemployment matters, occupational and personal injury claims, property damage or freight damage, environmental and other matters. the company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits. although the company maintains insurance to cover some of these types of claims and establishes reserves when appropriate, final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may exceed the company's insurance coverage or differ materially from the recorded reserves. additionally, the company could be impacted by adverse developments not currently reflected in the company's reserve estimates.
operational, safety and business disruption an epidemic or pandemic and the initiatives to reduce its transmission could adversely affect the company's business.
the company could be materially and adversely affected by a public health crisis, including a widespread epidemic or pandemic. during a health crisis, policies and initiatives may be instituted by the public and private sector to reduce transmission, such as closures of businesses and manufacturing facilities, the promotion of social distancing, the adoption of working from home by companies and institutions, and travel restrictions. these policies or initiatives could adversely affect demand for the commodities and products that the company transports, including import and export volume.
in addition, initiatives to reduce transmission could result in supply chain disruptions, which could impact volumes and make it more difficult for the company to serve its customers. moreover, operations are negatively affected when a significant number of employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness. to the extent a public health crisis adversely affects the company's business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein.
the company relies on the security, stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business.
the company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. the security, stability and availability of the company's and its key third-party vendors' information technology systems are critical to its ability to operate safely and effectively and to compete within the transportation industry. a successful data breach, cyber-attack, or the occurrence of any similar incident that impacts the company's or its key third-party vendors' information technology systems could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information (including personal information), process failure, or other operational difficulties. a disruption or compromise of the company's or its key third-party vendors' information technology systems, even for short periods of time, and any resulting theft or compromise of company confidential or proprietary information (including personal information), could adversely affect the company's business or reputation, create significant legal, regulatory or financial exposure and have a material adverse impact on csx's business, financial condition or operations.

csx corporation part i the company, its third-party vendors and other companies in the rail and transportation industries have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, data breaches, cyber-attacks and other similar incidents. these incidents may include, among other things, malware, ransomware, distributed denial of service attacks, social engineering, phishing, theft, malfeasance or improper access by employees or third-party vendors, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, human error, fraud, or other modes of attack or disruption. attacks of these nature are increasing in frequency, levels of persistence, intensity and sophistication, including by nation-state threat actors or those associated with nation-states. further, the company may be at increased risk of experiencing a cyber-attack as a result of being a component of the critical u.s. infrastructure. if such an event takes place, the company may be required to incur significant expenses in excess of existing cybersecurity insurance coverage. as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, the company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities, data breaches, cyber-attacks or other similar incidents. the company or its third-party vendors may also experience cybersecurity incidents as a result of employees, third-party vendors and other third parties with which they interact working remotely on less secure systems and environments.
despite the company's efforts to protect its information technology systems, it may not be able to prevent or anticipate all data breaches, cyber-attacks or other similar incidents, detect or react to such incidents in a timely manner or adequately remediate any such incident. due to applicable laws, rules and regulations or contractual obligations, csx may be held responsible for data breaches, cyber-attacks or other similar incidents attributed to its third-party vendors as they relate to the information csx shares with them.
additionally, if csx is unable to successfully acquire, develop or implement new technology, including artificial intelligence, it may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation services.
network or supply chain constraints could have a negative impact on service, operating efficiency or volume of shipments.
csxt could experience rail network difficulties related to: (i) locomotive or crew shortages; (ii) labor shortages or other service disruptions in the supply chain affecting trucking, ports, handling facilities, customer facilities or other railroads; (iii) unpredictable increases in demand; (iv) extreme weather conditions; (v) regulatory changes resulting in forced access or impacting where and how fast csxt can transport freight or maintain routes; (vi) reductions in availability of pooled equipment, including chassis; (vii) impacts from changes in network capacity or structure; or (viii) increased passenger activities, which could impact csxt's operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and overall efficiency.
csxt, as a common carrier by rail, transports hazardous materials, which could expose the company to significant costs and claims in the event of a train accident.
a train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant costs and claims arising from personal injury, property or natural resource damage, environmental penalties and remediation obligations. such claims, if insured, could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. under federal regulations, csxt is required to transport certain hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate regardless of risk or potential exposure to loss.
csx 2023 form 10-k p.9
csx corporation part i future acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the company's operations.
terrorist attacks, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. csxt's rail lines, other key infrastructure and information technology systems may be targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war. this risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. in addition, premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the company could increase dramatically, or the coverage may no longer be available.
furthermore, in response to the heightened risk of terrorism, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and, in some cases, have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry. for example, the department of homeland security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials. complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase the company's operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies.
severe weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage.
the company's operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including floods, hurricanes, fires and earthquakes. as a result, the company's rail network may be damaged, its workforce may be unavailable, fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur. in addition, the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions. hurricanes as well as storm and flooding events have impacted the company's network in the past, leading to interrupted service and damage to track and equipment. changes in weather patterns caused by climate change are expected to increase the frequency, severity or duration of certain adverse weather conditions.
insurance maintained by the company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the company's damages or damages to others, and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service, the company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations.
competitive, economic and financial the company faces competition from other transportation providers.
the company experiences competition in pricing, service, reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. other transportation providers generally use public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while csxt and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources. any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation such as through the use of automation, autonomy or electrification, or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the company's competitive position. additionally, any future consolidation in the rail industry could materially affect the regulatory and competitive environment in which the company operates.
csx 2023 form 10-k p.10
csx corporation part i global economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight.
a decline or disruption in general domestic and global economic conditions that affects demand for the commodities and products the company transports, including import and export volume, could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects on the company's cost structure and profitability. for example, slower rates of economic growth in asia, contraction of european economies, and changes in the global supply of seaborne coal or price of seaborne coal have adverse impacts on u.s. export coal volume and result in lower coal revenue for csx. additionally, embargoes or changes to trade agreements or policies could result in reduced import and export volumes due to increased tariffs and lower consumer demand. if the company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products or continues to experience the impacts of inflation, the company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs, workforce adjustments, and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
changing dynamics in the u.s. and global energy markets could negatively impact profitability.
over time, changing dynamics in the u.s. and global energy markets, including the impacts of regulation and alternative fuel sources, have resulted in lower energy production from coal-fired power plants in csx's service territory. changes in natural gas prices, or other factors impacting demand for electricity, could impact future power generation at coal-fired plants, which would affect the company's coal volumes and revenues.
weaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the company's access to capital.
the company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of long-term debt instruments, commercial paper and bank financing from time to time. instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including credit markets, significant increases in interest rates, or the deterioration of the company's financial condition due to internal or external factors, could restrict or prohibit access and could increase financing costs. a significant deterioration of the company's financial condition could also reduce credit ratings and could limit or affect its access to external sources of capital and increase the costs of short and long-term debt financing.
availability of critical supplies and labor the unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the company's operational efficiency and ability to meet demand.
marketplace conditions for resources like locomotives as well as the availability of qualified personnel, including engineers and conductors as well as other skilled professional or technical employees, could each have a negative impact on the company's ability to meet demand for rail service. although the company strives to maintain adequate resources and personnel for the current business environment, unpredictable increases in demand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on the company's operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular period.
csx 2023 form 10-k p.11
csx corporation part i disruption to a key railroad industry supplier could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs.
the capital intensive and unique nature of core rail equipment (including rail, ties, freight cars and locomotives) limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers. if any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage, csxt could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage. in addition, a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and, as such, adverse developments in international relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase csxt's costs. additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, the company would be negatively impacted.
failure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages.
most of csx's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. these agreements are either bargained for nationally by the national carriers conference committee or locally between csx and the union. such agreements are negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages. under the railway labor act's procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of an intervention by the president of the united states), during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted. if, however, csx is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, the employees covered by the railway labor act could strike, which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members.
climate change and environmental the company's operations and financial results could be negatively impacted by climate change and regulatory and legislative responses to climate change.
there is potential for operational impacts from changing weather patterns or rising sea levels in the company's operational territory, which could impact the company's network or other assets.
climate change and other emissions-related laws and regulations have been proposed and, in some cases adopted, on the federal, state, provincial and local levels. these final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on emissions as well as requirements to disclose information relating to climate change. in particular, the epa has issued various regulations and may issue additional regulations targeting emissions, including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles. any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations, could adversely affect the company's operations and financial results by, among other things: (i) reducing coal-fired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards; (ii) reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the united states and canada; (iii) increasing the company's fuel, capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies; and (iv) making it difficult for the company's customers in the u.s. and canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner. any of these factors could reduce the amount of shipments the company handles and have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. in addition, csx may become subject to legal requirements to disclose climate change related information and may become subject to demands or expectations by its supply chain partners, customers or other stakeholders to disclose information relating to climate risk or set related targets or goals. the company's current practices with respect to climate risk disclosure may fail to meet these developing legal requirements or stakeholder demands or expectations. in addition, legislative or regulatory uncertainties and change regarding climate-related risks, including inconsistent perspectives or requirements, are likely to result in higher regulatory, compliance, credit, reputational and other risks and costs.

csx corporation part i the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs.
the company is subject to wide-ranging federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, ground and water; the handling, storage, use, generation, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials; the clean-up of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees. if the company violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations, csx could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. the company can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous substances for which csx is responsible. in certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned, leased or used by the company.
the company has been, and may in the future be, subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the company's incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of environmental contamination. although the company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing. the company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination.

csx corporation part ii revenue total revenue decreased by $196 million in 2023, or 1%, when compared to the previous year primarily due to decreases in other revenue, lower fuel recovery, pricing declines in export coal due to the impact of lower benchmark rates and declines in intermodal volume. these declines were partially offset by pricing and volume gains in merchandise and higher coal volumes.
merchandise volume chemicals - increased shipments of export plastics, waste, and sand were offset by lower shipments of materials used in making plastics.
agricultural and food products - decreased primarily due to lower shipments of ethanol and export grain.
automotive - increased due to higher north american vehicle production as well as new business wins.
minerals - increased due to higher shipments of aggregates and cement driven by increased road construction and other infrastructure-related activities.
metals and equipment - increased due to higher steel and scrap shipments, as well as stronger equipment shipments.
forest products - decreased primarily due to lower shipments of pulpboard, paper, and lumber, partially offset by higher shipments of other building products.
fertilizers - decreased due to declines in short-haul shipments, which were partially offset by increases in long-haul potash and phosphate shipments.
intermodal volume lower volume was due to decreased international shipments driven by high inventory levels and lower imports. domestic shipments increased due to growth with key customers as well as the prior year impact of supply-side constraints.
coal volume export coal increased due to higher shipments of metallurgical and thermal coal. domestic coal decreased due to lower shipments of coal to northern utility plants.
trucking revenue trucking revenue decreased $84 million versus the prior year due to lower fuel and capacity surcharges.
other revenue other revenue was $330 million lower, primarily resulting from lower intermodal storage and equipment usage.

csx corporation part ii expense in 2023, total expenses increased $266 million, or 3%, compared to prior year. descriptions of each expense category as well as significant year-over-year changes are described below.
labor and fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-retirement benefits and incentive compensation. these expenses increased $163 million due to the following items:
•an increase of $144 million was driven by inflation.
•an increase of $89 million was due to the impacts of higher headcount and union employee vacation and sick benefits.
•incentive compensation costs decreased $34 million primarily due to lower expected payouts as well as the impacts of accelerated expense for eligible employees in the prior year.
•prior year amounts included $32 million of out-of-period labor and benefit costs due to the agreement reached with labor unions.
•other costs decreased by $4 million due to non-significant items.
purchased services and other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment, terminal and pier services, purchased trucking and other transportation, and professional services. this category also includes costs related to materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items. total purchased services and other expenses increased $79 million driven by the following:
•an increase of $101 million was due to higher operating support costs, which were primarily due to inflation and higher repair and maintenance costs. these increases were partially offset by lower volume and reduced congestion in intermodal operations.
•a decrease of $54 million was due to insurance recoveries in the current year.
•all other costs increased $32 million as higher technology spending, inflation and other increases were partially offset by lower trucking expenses and other non-significant items.
depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of capital assets, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over their respective useful lives, which are reviewed periodically as part of depreciation studies. this expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. depreciation expense increased $111 million primarily due to the impacts of a 2022 equipment depreciation study as well as a larger net asset base.
fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. this expense is largely driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. fuel expense decreased $249 million primarily due to a 19% decrease in locomotive fuel prices, partially offset by higher fuel consumption.
equipment and other rents expense includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by csxt for use of its equipment. this category of expenses also includes expenses for short-term and long-term leases of locomotives, railcars, containers, tractors and trailers, offices and other rentals. these expenses decreased $42 million primarily due to lower car hire costs from improved car cycle times, partially offset by costs related to higher automotive volume.
gains on property dispositions decreased to $34 million in 2023 from $238 million in 2022 primarily due to the inclusion of $144 million of gains in 2022 from the sale of property rights to the commonwealth of virginia.

csx corporation part ii interest expense interest expense includes interest on long-term debt and related fair value hedges, equipment obligations and finance leases. interest expense increased $67 million primarily as a result of higher average debt balances and higher effective interest rates.
other income - net other income - net includes investment gains, losses, interest income, components of net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit cost and other non-operating activities. other income increased $6 million primarily due to higher interest income and other non-significant items, partially offset by a decrease in net pension benefit credits.
income tax expense income tax expense decreased $72 million primarily due to lower earnings before income taxes, partially offset by prior year favorable state legislative changes.
net earnings and earnings per diluted share net earnings decreased $451 million to $3.7 billion, and earnings per diluted share decreased $0.10 to $1.85, due to the factors mentioned above. average shares outstanding was lower as a result of share repurchase activity during the year and had a favorable impact on earnings per diluted share.

csx corporation part ii non-gaap measures (unaudited)
csx reports its financial results in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). csx also uses certain non-gaap measures that fall within the meaning of securities and exchange commission regulation g and regulation s-k item 10(e), which may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparison to prior reported results. non-gaap measures do not have standardized definitions and are not defined by gaap. therefore, csx's non-gaap measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. the presentation of these non-gaap measures should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to the financial information presented in accordance with gaap. reconciliations of non-gaap measures to corresponding gaap measures are below.
economic profit management believes economic profit (csx cash earnings or cce) provides additional perspective to investors about financial returns generated by the business by representing a profit generated over and above the cost of capital used by the business to generate that profit. economic profit is designed to incentivize strategic investments that earn more than the required return. increases in economic profit indicate that the company is effectively allocating capital and rewarding shareholders by generating growth in excess of the incremental cost of capital associated with reinvestment in the business. this measure should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, net income. this measure is defined by the company as gross cash earnings minus the capital charge on gross operating assets. gross cash earnings is calculated as adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("adjusted ebitda"), less an assumed 15% cash tax. the capital charge uses a long-term average cost of capital of 8% multiplied by the gross operating assets. csx's gross operating assets include gross properties and other non-cash assets, net of non-interest bearing liabilities.
the following table reconciles net income (gaap measure) to economic profit (non-gaap measure).

csx corporation part ii free cash flow management believes free cash flow is useful to investors as it is important in evaluating the company's financial performance. more specifically, free cash flow measures cash generated by the business after reinvestment. this measure represents cash available for both equity and bond investors to be used for dividends, share repurchases or principal reduction on outstanding debt. free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and proceeds from property dispositions. this measure should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. free cash flow before dividends decreased $412 million year-over-year to $3.3 billion primarily due to lower proceeds and advances from property dispositions, mostly attributable to the sale of property rights to the commonwealth of virginia in the prior year, as well as higher property additions and less cash from operating activities. cash from operating activities includes lower cash-generating net earnings and the impact of $168 million of higher payments for retroactive wages and bonuses, and associated taxes, related to finalized labor agreements as well as the offsetting impact of $381 million of postponed federal estimated tax payments, which were extended until first quarter 2024 under an internal revenue service tax relief announcement for those impacted by hurricane idalia.

csx corporation part ii the company is committed to continuous improvement in safety and service performance through training, innovation and investment. training and safety programs are designed to prevent incidents that can adversely impact employees, customers and communities. technological innovations that can detect and avoid many types of human factor incidents are designed to serve as an additional layer of protection for the company's employees. continued capital investment in the company's assets, including track, bridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance.
the company remains focused on safety, service, and controlling costs. velocity and dwell improved 12% and 17%, respectively, relative to 2022. carload trip plan performance improved to 84% compared to 64% while intermodal trip plan performance improved to 95% compared to 90%, relative to 2022. csx has seen an improvement in service metrics throughout 2023.
from a safety perspective, the fra personal injury index improved by 12% and the train-accident rate improved by 1% compared to prior year. safety is a guiding principle at csx and the company remains focused on its strong safety culture, including instilling the importance of safety in new hires. csx is committed to reducing risk and enhancing the overall safety of its employees, customers and communities in which the company operates.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a company's ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures, including those to address regulatory and legislative requirements. to have a complete picture of a company's liquidity, its sources and uses of cash, balance sheet and external factors should be reviewed.
significant cash flows the following charts highlight the operating, investing and financing components of the change in cash and cash equivalents for operating, investing and financing activities for full years 2023 and 2022.
in 2023, the company generated $5.5 billion of cash from operating activities, which was $70 million less than prior year primarily driven by lower cash-generating net earnings and $168 million higher payments for retroactive wages and bonuses, including the associated taxes, related to finalized labor agreements. this decrease was partially offset by the impact of $381 million of postponed federal estimated tax payments mentioned above. net cash used in investing activities was $2.3 billion, an increase in net spend of $156 million from the prior year primarily due to lower proceeds from property dispositions and higher property additions, partially offset by decreased acquisition spending. cash used in financing activities was $3.9 billion, which represents an increase in net spend of $98 million from the prior year primarily due to lower proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by lower share repurchases.
csx 2023 form 10-k p.36
csx corporation part ii sources of cash and liquidity the company has multiple sources of liquidity, including cash generated from operations and financing sources. the company filed a shelf registration statement with the sec on february 16, 2022, which may be used to issue debt or equity securities at csx's discretion, subject to market conditions and csx board authorization. while csx seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit csx to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all. in 2023, csx issued $600 million of long-term debt. see note 10, debt and credit agreements for more information.
csx has access to a $1.2 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks that expires in february 2028. as of december 31, 2023, the company had no outstanding balances under this facility. the company also has a commercial paper program, backed by the revolving credit facility, under which the company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion outstanding at any one time. as of december 31, 2023, the company had no outstanding debt under the commercial paper program.
uses of cash csx uses current cash balances for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, working capital requirements, reduction or refinancing of outstanding indebtedness, redemptions and repurchases of csx common stock, dividends to shareholders, acquisitions and other business opportunities, and contributions to the company's qualified pension plan.
in 2023, csx continued to invest in its business to create long-term value for shareholders. the company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for long-term, profitable growth through optimizing network and terminal capacity. funds used for property additions are further described below.

planned capital investments for 2024 are expected to be approximately $2.5 billion. spending to sustain core infrastructure with a focus on safety and reliability will be a top priority. in addition, management is committed to investments that promote profitable growth, including projects supporting service enhancements and productivity initiatives, including investments in locomotives and freight cars. csx intends to fund capital investments primarily through cash generated from operations.
csx is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the company's ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments. csx may revise its future estimates for capital spending as a result of changes in business conditions, tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's operations and financial performance in the future (see risk factors under item 1a of this form 10-k).
csx 2023 form 10-k p.37
csx corporation part ii csx is committed to returning cash to shareholders. capital structure, capital investments and cash distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, are reviewed at least annually by the board of directors. on february 14, 2024, the company's board of directors authorized a 9% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.12 per common share effective march 2024. management's assessment of market conditions and other factors guides the timing and volume of repurchases. future share repurchases are expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt issuances.
material changes in the consolidated balance sheets and working capital csx's balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of csx's balanced approach in deploying capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes investments in infrastructure, dividend payments and share repurchases. further, csx is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. the company ended the year with $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
total assets as well as total liabilities and shareholders' equity increased $496 million from prior year end. the increase in total assets was primarily due to a $693 million increase in net properties consistent with planned capital expenditures, a $113 million increase in net pension assets for qualified pension plans, a $105 million increase in materials and supplies and a $105 million increase in investments in affiliates and other companies. these increases were partially offset by a $605 million decrease in cash as noted above.
total liabilities increased $988 million from prior year end primarily due to the issuance of $600 million in long-term debt, a $414 million increase in income and other taxes payable largely related to postponed federal estimated tax payments, a $177 million increase in deferred income taxes and a $107 million increase in accounts payable. these increases were partially offset by payouts of accrued retroactive wages and bonuses totaling $238 million and debt repayments of $153 million. total shareholders' equity decreased $492 million from prior year end primarily driven by share repurchases of $3.5 billion and dividends paid of $882 million, partially offset by net earnings of $3.7 billion.
working capital is considered a measure of a company's ability to meet its short-term needs. csx had a working capital surplus of $160 million at december 2023 and $1.4 billion at december 2022. this decrease of $1.2 billion since year end is primarily due to cash paid for share repurchases of $3.5 billion, property additions of $2.3 billion and dividend payments of $882 million, as well as a $558 million of long-term debt maturing in 2024. these decreases were partially offset by cash earned from operations of $5.5 billion and $600 million in cash received from debt issued.
csx 2023 form 10-k p.38
csx corporation part ii the company's working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances. although the company currently has a surplus, a working capital deficit is not unusual for csx or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. the company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. furthermore, csx has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, commercial paper program and shelf registration statement to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. the company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity.
completed transactions acquisition of pan am systems, inc.
on june 1, 2022, csx completed its acquisition of pan am. the closing price of $600 million was funded through a combination of common stock valued at $422 million and cash totaling $178 million. total cash consideration paid to acquire the business includes a $30 million deposit paid in fourth quarter 2020. for further details, refer to note 17, business combinations.
acquisition of quality carriers, inc.
on july 1, 2021, csx acquired quality carriers, inc. for a purchase price of $544 million in cash. this transaction was funded by cash on hand. for further details, refer to note 17, business combinations.
sale of property rights to the commonwealth of virginia on march 26, 2021, the company entered into a comprehensive agreement to sell certain property rights in three csx-owned line segments to the commonwealth of virginia ("commonwealth") over three phases. over the course of the transaction, which was completed in 2022, total proceeds of $525 million were collected and total gains of $493 million were recognized. this includes $125 million of proceeds collected and $144 million of gains recognized in 2022. for further details, refer to note 6, properties.

csx corporation part ii credit ratings credit ratings reflect an independent agency's judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. the ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower's industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company's cash flows to changes in the economy. the two largest rating agencies, standard & poor's ratings services ("s&p") and moody's investors service ("moody's"), use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. the highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is aaa and aaa for s&p and moody's, respectively. a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.
the cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by csx's long-term credit ratings. csx's credit ratings improved during 2023 following an upgrade by moody's from a long-term rating baa1 (stable) as of december 2022 to a3 (stable) as of december 2023. s&p's long-term rating for csx remains consistent at bbb+ (stable) for both december 2022 and december 2023. ratings of bbb- and baa3 or better by s&p and moody's, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade. if csx's credit ratings were to decline to below investment-grade levels, the company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt. in addition, a decline in csx's credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market's demand, and thus the company's ability to readily issue new debt. the company is committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile.

csx corporation part ii contractual obligations, other commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations csx is party to contractual arrangements that obligate the company to make future cash payments. these obligations impact the company's liquidity and capital resource needs. the company's contractual obligations primarily consist of long-term debt and related interest payments, purchase commitments, leases, other-post employment benefits and agreements with conrail.
•as of december 31, 2023, the company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities. see note 10, debt and credit agreements, for additional information related to future debt payments. future interest payments associated with outstanding debt total $14.3 billion, with $804 million payable in 2024.
•purchase commitments consist of csx's long-term locomotive maintenance program and other commitments to purchase technology, communications, railcar maintenance and other services. see note 8, commitments and contingencies, for additional information about future payments related to purchase commitments.
•capital expenditures include investments related to public-private partnerships. these partnership investments are typically for projects that are partially or wholly reimbursed to csx through government awards or other funding sources. project contribution commitments that are not reimbursable total $55 million as of december 31, 2023.
•the company's leases include property, equipment, and line leases. see note 7, leases, for additional information about future payments related to leases.
•other post-employment benefits include estimated other post-retirement medical and life insurance payments and payments under non-qualified pension plans that are unfunded. see note 9, employee benefit plans, for additional information about future payments under such plans.
•conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of csx and norfolk southern corporation ("ns"). this is known as the shared asset area. conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. see note 15, investment in affiliates and related-party transactions, for additional information about future payments related to agreements with conrail.
other commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements other commitments total $187 million and primarily consist of guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds, none of which are individually significant. these off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
labor agreements approximately 17,700 of the company's approximately 23,000 employees are members of a rail labor union. as of december 2, 2022, all 12 rail unions at csx that participated in national bargaining were covered by national agreements with the class i railroads and csx-specific agreements that will remain in effect through december 31, 2024. collective agreements under the railway labor act do not expire, but continue until amended, and formal notices to amend these agreements may be served as early as november 1, 2024.

csx corporation part ii critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results may differ from those estimates. these estimates and assumptions are discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a regular basis. significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas:
•personal injury and environmental reserves;
•pension plan accounting; and
•depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method personal injury and environmental reserves personal injury personal injury reserves of $128 million and $126 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively, represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. csxt retains an independent actuary to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims. the methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. it is based largely on csxt's historical claims and settlement experience. actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation. for additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see note 5, casualty, environmental and other reserves, in the consolidated financial statements.
environmental environmental reserves were $154 million and $161 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively. the company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and regulatory agencies. the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 230 environmentally impaired sites. the company reviews its potential liability with respect to each site identified, giving consideration to a number of factors such as:
•type of clean-up required;
•nature of the company's alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site);
•extent of the company's alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and
•number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location.
conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in additional exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated. for additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see note 5, casualty, environmental and other reserves, in the consolidated financial statements.
csx 2023 form 10-k p.42
csx corporation part ii critical accounting estimates, continued pension plan accounting the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. for employees hired prior to 2003, the plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. for employees hired between 2003 and 2019, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation. beginning in 2020, the csx pension plan was closed to new participants. as of december 2023, the projected benefit obligation for the company's pension plans was $2.3 billion. for information related to the funded status of the company's pension plans, see note 9, employee benefit plans.
the accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the compensation-retirement benefits topic in the accounting standards codification ("asc"). this rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following:
•discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense;
•long-term rate of return on plan assets; and
•other assumptions.
the company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the company determines are appropriate based on historical trends, current market rates and future projections. these amounts are reviewed by management.
critical accounting estimates, continued discount rates discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the service and interest cost components of pension expense. discount rates reflect the rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the company's expected future benefit payments. the company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of year-end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans' expected benefit payments.
the company measures the service and interest cost components of the net pension benefits expense by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year. under the spot rate approach, individual spot discount rates along the same high quality corporate bonds yield curve used to measure the pension benefit liabilities are applied to the relevant projected cash flows at the relevant maturity.
the weighted average discount rate used by the company to value its pension obligations was 4.82% and 5.02% as of december 2023, and december 2022, respectively. as of december 2023, the estimated duration of pension benefits is approximately 9 years.
each year, the discount rate is reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate bonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. in general, if interest rates decline or rise, the assumed discount rate will change.
csx 2023 form 10-k p.43
csx corporation part ii critical accounting estimates, continued long-term rate of return on plan assets the expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. in estimating that rate, the company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds. management, with the assistance of an outsourced investment manager, balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. as this assumption is long term, the annual review may result in less frequent adjustment than other assumptions used in pension accounting. the long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the company to value its benefit cost for the subsequent plan year was 6.75% in both 2023 and 2022.
other assumptions the calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to mortality rates, turnover, retirement age and salary inflation rates. these assumptions are based upon historical data, recent plan experience and industry trends and are determined by management.
2024 estimated pension expense net periodic pension benefit expense for 2024 is expected to be a credit of $22 million. net periodic pension benefit expense for 2024 is expected to include service cost expense of $23 million. service cost expense is included in labor and fringe on the consolidated income statement and all other components of net pension expense are included in other income - net. net periodic pension expense in 2023 was a credit of $1 million. the net increase in the expected credit is primarily due to impacts from recent favorable pension asset experience.
the following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effects of a 1% change in certain assumptions on the 2024 estimated pension expense:
(dollars in millions)                  pension expense discount rate                              $12

csx corporation part ii critical accounting estimates, continued depreciation policies for assets utilizing the group-life method the depreciable assets of the company are depreciated using either the group-life or straight-line method of accounting, which are both acceptable depreciation methods in accordance with gaap. the company depreciates its railroad assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method of accounting. assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise 84% of total fixed assets of $50.3 billion on a gross basis at december 31, 2023. the remaining depreciable assets of the company, including non-railroad assets and assets under finance leases, are depreciated using the straight-line method on a per asset basis. land is not depreciated.
management performs a review of depreciation expense and useful lives on a regular basis. under the group-life method, the service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and applying management's methods to determine the service lives of its properties. there are several factors taken into account during the depreciation study and they include:
•statistical analysis of historical life and salvage data for each group of property;
•statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property;
•evaluation of current operations;
•evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules;
•previous assessment of the condition of the assets;
•management's outlook on the future use of certain asset groups;
•expected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and
•comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies.
the stb requires depreciation studies be performed every three years for equipment assets (e.g., locomotives and freight cars) and every six years for road and track assets (e.g., bridges, signals, rail, ties, and ballast). the company completed a depreciation study for its road and track assets in 2020 and for equipment assets in 2022, both of which resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation, service lives, salvage values, and other related factors for certain assets. the 2022 equipment study resulted in an increase in annual depreciation expense of approximately $80 million primarily due to deferred losses on assets depreciated using the group-life method. a depreciation study was not performed in 2023.
a 1% change in the average estimated useful life of all group-life assets would result in an approximate $13 million change to the company's annual depreciation expense. there were no significant changes to the company's asset lives as a result of the 2022 and 2020 studies. for additional details, including a more detailed description of our related accounting policies, see note 6, properties, in the consolidated financial statements.

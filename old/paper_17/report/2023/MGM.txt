item 1a.    risk factors you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any other of our filings with the sec could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. in evaluating us, you should consider carefully, among other things, the risks described below.
summary of risk factors the following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.
risks related to our substantial financial commitments
•our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments, including our rent payments and guarantees we provide on the indebtedness of the landlords of bellagio, mandalay bay, and mgm grand las vegas could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our ability to satisfy our obligations.
•current and future economic, capital and credit market conditions could adversely affect our ability to service our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments or make planned expenditures.
•the agreements governing our senior credit facility and other senior indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity, and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations.
•we are required to pay a significant portion of our cash flows as rent, which could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and growth initiatives, service our indebtedness and limit our ability to react to competitive and economic changes.
risks related to our business, industry, and market conditions
•we face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete, including increased competition through online sports betting and igaming, and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
•our business is affected by economic and market conditions in the jurisdictions in which we operate and in the locations in which our customers reside.
•we have suspended our payment of ongoing regular dividends to our stockholders, and may not elect to resume paying dividends in the foreseeable future or at all.
•all of our domestic gaming facilities are leased and could experience risks associated with leased property, including risks relating to lease termination, lease extensions, charges and our relationship with the lessor, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.
•because a significant number of our major gaming resorts are concentrated on the las vegas strip, we are subject to greater risks than a gaming company that is more geographically diversified.
•we extend credit to a large portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables.
•we may incur impairments to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets which could negatively affect our future profits.
•leisure and business travel, especially travel by air, are particularly susceptible to global geopolitical events, such as terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or acts of war or hostility or the outbreak of infectious diseases.
•co-investing in properties or businesses, including our investment in betmgm, decreases our ability to manage risk.
•any of our future construction, development or expansion projects will be subject to significant development and construction risks, which could have a material adverse impact on related project timetables, costs and our ability to complete the projects.
•our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer. in addition, our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future.
•any failure to protect our intellectual property could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business.
•a significant portion of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements.
•our business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results.
•we may seek to expand through investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances or acquisitions, and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets, any of which may be unsuccessful.
•the failure to maintain the integrity of our information and other systems or customer information can result in damage to our reputation, subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits and restrictions on our use of data, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
•we are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility and reputation.
•we are subject to risks and costs related to climate change.
•water scarcity could negatively impact our operations.
risks related to legal and regulatory matters and changes in public policy
•our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations.
•any violation of the foreign corrupt practices act or any other similar anti-corruption laws could have a negative impact on us.
•if the jurisdictions in which we operate increase taxes and fees, including gaming taxes, our results could be adversely affected.
•the future recognition of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is uncertain, and the amount of valuation allowance we may apply against such deferred tax asset may change materially in future periods.
•we face risks related to pending claims that have been, or future claims that may be, brought against us.
risks related to our macau operations
•we have agreed not to have any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in china, macau, hong kong and taiwan, other than through mgm china.
•the macau government can (i) terminate mgm grand paradise's concession under certain circumstances without compensating mgm grand paradise, (ii) from the eighth year of mgm grand paradise's concession, redeem the concession by providing mgm grand paradise at least one year's prior notice and subject to the payment of reasonable and fair damages or indemnity to mgm grand paradise, or (iii) refuse to grant mgm grand paradise an extension of the concession prior to its expiry.
•we are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the united states.
•conflicts of interest may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also directors of mgm china, the holding company for mgm grand paradise which owns and operates mgm macau and mgm cotai.
for a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, please see below.
risks related to our substantial financial commitments our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments, including our rent payments and guarantees we provide of the indebtedness of the landlords of bellagio, mandalay bay, and mgm grand las vegas could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our ability to satisfy our obligations. as of december 31, 2023, we had approximately $6.4 billion of principal amount of indebtedness outstanding on a consolidated basis, including $3.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness of mgm china. any increase in the interest rates applicable to our existing or future borrowings would increase the cost of our indebtedness and reduce the cash flow available to fund our other liquidity needs. we do not guarantee mgm china's obligations under its debt agreements and, to the extent mgm china was to cease to produce cash flow sufficient to service its indebtedness, our ability to make additional investments into mgm china is limited by the covenants in our existing senior credit facility.
in addition, our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative consequences on us, including:
•increasing our exposure to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
•limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;
•limiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy (including returning value to our shareholders) or other general operating requirements;
•making it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness; or
•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less-leveraged competitors.
we currently also provide shortfall guarantees of the $3.01 billion and $3.0 billion principal amount of indebtedness (and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon) of the landlords of bellagio and mandalay bay and mgm grand las vegas, respectively. the terms of each guarantee provide that, after the lenders have exhausted certain remedies to collect on the obligations under the underlying indebtedness, we would then be responsible for any shortfall between the value of the collateral and the debt obligation, which amount may be material, and we may not have sufficient cash on hand to fund any such obligation to the extent it is triggered in the future. if we do not have sufficient cash on hand, we may need to raise capital, including incurring additional indebtedness, in order to satisfy our obligation. there can be no assurance that any financing will be available to us, or, if available, will be on terms that are satisfactory to us.
under the terms of mgm grand paradise's concession, mgm grand paradise is required to implement certain investments in gaming and non-gaming projects, for which the non-gaming commitment is subject to increase if market-wide macau annual gross gaming revenue reaches a specified level, as further discussed in note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. there can be no assurance, however, that mgm grand paradise will have sufficient cash on hand to fund these obligations, including any increased investment amounts to the extent they are triggered in the future, or that it would be able to obtain financing to fund these obligations on satisfactory terms or at all. if mgm grand paradise is unable to satisfy its investment commitments, its concession contract may be subject to termination by the macau government. see "-risks related to our macau operations-the macau government can (i) terminate mgm grand paradise's concession under certain circumstances without compensating mgm grand paradise, (ii) from the eighth year of mgm grand paradise's concession, redeem the concession by providing mgm grand paradise at least one year's prior notice and subject to the payment of reasonable and fair damages or indemnity to mgm grand paradise, or (iii) refuse to grant mgm grand paradise an extension of the concession prior to its expiry."
moreover, our businesses are capital intensive. for our owned, leased and managed properties to remain attractive and competitive, we must periodically invest significant capital to keep the properties well-maintained, modernized and refurbished. the leases for our operating properties have fixed rental payments (with annual escalators) and also require us to apply a percentage of net revenues generated at the leased properties to capital expenditures at those properties. such investments require an ongoing supply of cash and, to the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations, funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained. similarly, development projects, including any potential future development of an integrated resort in japan, strategic initiatives, including positioning betmgm as a leader in online sports betting and igaming, investments in the growth of our international digital gaming business, and acquisitions could require significant capital commitments, the incurrence of additional debt, guarantees of third-party debt or the incurrence of contingent liabilities, any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
current and future economic, capital and credit market conditions could adversely affect our ability to service our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments or make planned expenditures. our ability to make payments on our substantial indebtedness and other significant financial commitments, including the rent payments under our leases, and to fund planned or committed capital expenditures and other investments depends on our ability to generate cash flow, receive distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates and subsidiaries (including mgm china), and borrow under our senior credit facility or incur new indebtedness. if regional and national economic conditions deteriorate, including in connection with a recession, revenues from our operations could decline as consumer spending levels decrease and we could fail to generate cash sufficient to fund our liquidity needs or satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt and lease instruments. if we fail to generate cash sufficient to fund our liquidity needs or satisfy the financial and other covenants in our debt and lease instruments, we cannot assure you that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or fund our other liquidity needs or that we will be able to access the capital markets in the future to borrow additional debt on terms favorable to us, or at all.
in addition, we have a significant amount of indebtedness maturing in 2025, and thereafter. our ability to fund or timely refinance and replace our indebtedness will depend upon the economic and credit market conditions discussed above. if we are unable to fund or refinance our indebtedness on a timely basis, we might be forced to seek alternate forms of financing, dispose of assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments. there is no assurance that any of these alternatives would be available to us, if at all, on satisfactory terms, on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us, or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements or leases.
the agreements governing our senior credit facility and other senior indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity, and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations. covenants governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our debt securities restrict, among other things, our ability to:
•pay dividends or distributions, repurchase equity, prepay certain debt or make certain investments;
•incur additional debt;
•incur liens on assets;
•sell assets or consolidate with another company or sell all or substantially all of our assets;
•enter into transactions with affiliates;
•allow certain subsidiaries to transfer assets or enter into certain agreements; and
•enter into sale and lease-back transactions.
our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. the breach of any such covenants or obligations not otherwise waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements governing our long-term indebtedness. any default under our senior credit facility or the indentures could adversely affect our growth, our financial condition, our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt and other financial commitments.
in addition, mgm china has issued debt securities and is a borrower under credit facilities, all of which contain covenants that restrict the borrower's ability to engage in certain transactions, require mgm china to satisfy certain financial covenants and impose certain operating and financial restrictions on mgm china and its subsidiaries. these restrictions include, among other things, limitations on mgm china's ability to incur liens, merge or consolidate with other companies, or transfer, sell or dispose of all or substantially all of its assets.
we are required to pay a significant portion of our cash flows as rent, which could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and growth initiatives, service our indebtedness and limit our ability to react to competitive and economic changes. we are required to make annual rent payments of $1.8 billion, in the aggregate, under our triple-net lease agreements, which leases are also subject to annual escalators as described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. the leases also require us to spend a certain amount on capital expenditures at the leased properties. in addition, each of the leases obligates us to comply with certain financial covenants which, if not met, will require us to deposit cash collateral or issue letters of credit for the benefit of the applicable landlord equal to 6 months or 1 year of rent, as applicable to the circumstances, under the vici properties, inc. ("vici") lease, 1 year of rent under the mandalay bay and mgm grand las vegas lease, the aria and vdara lease, and the cosmopolitan lease, and 2 years of rent under the bellagio lease.
as a result of the foregoing rent and capital expenditure obligations, our ability to fund our operations, raise capital, make acquisitions, make investments, service our debt and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes may be adversely affected. for example, our obligations under the leases may:
•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to obtain additional indebtedness;
•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business;
•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to making rent payments, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development projects, pay dividends, repurchase shares and other general corporate purposes;
•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;
•restrict our ability to make acquisitions, divestitures and engage in other significant transactions; and
•cause us to lose our rights with respect to the applicable leased properties if we fail to pay rent or other amounts or otherwise default on the leases.
any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
risks related to our business, industry, and market conditions we face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete, including increased competition through online sports betting and igaming, and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the hotel, resort, entertainment, and gaming industries are highly competitive. we do not believe that our competition is limited to a particular geographic area, and hotel, resort, entertainment, and gaming operations in other states or countries, as well as the increased availability of online sports betting and igaming, could attract our customers. to the extent that new casinos enter our markets or hotel room capacity is expanded by others in major destination locations, competition will increase. major competitors, including potential new entrants, may also expand their hotel room capacity, expand their range of amenities, improve their level of service, or construct new resorts in las vegas, macau or in the domestic regional markets in which we operate, all of which could attract our customers. also, the growth of retail gaming in areas outside las vegas has increased the competition faced by our operations in las vegas and elsewhere, including growth in tribal gaming in states such as florida. in addition, in the last several years local referendums to allow retail gaming have passed in virginia and nebraska, with active lobbying occurring in states like texas and north carolina among others. while we believe our principal competitors are major gaming and hospitality resorts with well-established and recognized brands, we also compete against smaller hotel offerings and peer-to-peer inventory sources, which allow travelers to book short-term rentals of homes and apartments from owners. we expect that we will continue to face increased competition from new channels of distribution, innovations in consumer-facing technology platforms and other transformations in the travel industry that could impact our ability to attract and retain customers and related business.
we have also seen significant expansion across the united states in legalized forms of igaming and online sports betting and expect additional jurisdictions will likely legalize igaming and online sports betting in the future. we participate in the domestic igaming and online sports betting market through our venture, betmgm, which faces significant competition from other industry participants as well as the broader gaming and entertainment industries. if betmgm is unable to sustain or grow interest in its offerings it may not be able to gain the scale necessary to successfully compete in the growing market and, as a result, we may not receive the anticipated benefits from our investment. in addition, the expansion of igaming, online sports betting, and other types of gaming may further compete with our land-based operations by reducing customer visitation and spend at our properties.
in addition, competition could increase if changes in gaming restrictions in the united states and elsewhere are enacted, including the addition of new gaming establishments located closer to our customers than our casinos. for example, while our macau operations compete to some extent with casinos located elsewhere in or near asia, certain areas in the region have legalized casino gaming (including japan) and others (such as taiwan and thailand) may legalize casino gaming (or igaming) in the future. furthermore, currently mgm grand paradise holds one of only six gaming concessions authorized by the macau government to operate casinos in macau. if the macau government were to allow additional competitors to operate in macau through the grant of additional concessions or if current concessionaires open additional facilities, we would face increased competition. similarly, as a result of macau's gaming inspection and co-ordination bureau increased scrutiny and restrictions imposed on gaming promoters, we along with certain other casino operators in macau, suspended our primary gaming promoters in late 2021 and subsequently terminated our contractual arrangements with such promoters, which has led to substantial declines in revenues from gaming promoters. as a result, competition for the mass market segment amongst macau operators has substantially increased and we expect it to continue to grow and if we are unable to maintain and further develop our mass market business and replace revenue previously obtained through use of gaming promoters, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
most jurisdictions where casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical and/or geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses. although a number of jurisdictions in the united states and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming, in some cases new gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations and we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities (which may include acquisitions of existing properties) that do arise.
in addition to competition with other hotels, resorts and casinos, we compete with destination travel locations outside of the markets in which we operate. our failure to compete successfully in our various markets and to continue to attract customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our business is affected by economic and market conditions in the jurisdictions in which we operate and in the locations in which our customers reside. our business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending and corporate spending on conventions, trade shows and business development. adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, economic contraction, economic uncertainty or the perception by our customers of weak or weakening economic conditions may cause a decline in demand for hotels, casino resorts, trade shows and conventions, and for the type of luxury amenities we offer. in addition, changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences could be driven by factors such as the increased cost of travel, an unstable job market, perceived or actual disposable consumer income and wealth, outbreaks of contagious diseases or fears of war and acts of terrorism or other acts of violence. consumer preferences also evolve over time due to a variety of factors, including demographic changes, which, for instance, have resulted in recent growth in consumer demand for non-gaming offerings. our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the preferences of consumers and timely react to these trends, and any failure to do so may negatively impact our results of operations. in particular, aria, bellagio, mgm grand las vegas, and the cosmopolitan may be affected by economic conditions in the far east, and all of our nevada resorts are affected by economic conditions in the united states, and california in particular. a recession, economic slowdown or any other significant economic condition, including continued or increased inflationary pressures, affecting consumers, corporations, or the supply chain, generally is likely to cause a reduction in visitation to our properties, which would adversely affect our operating results. in addition, adverse market conditions may impact the labor market and cause disruptions to the global supply chain. if we are unable to hire and retain sufficient employees to operate our properties or procure necessary supplies, our business, results of operations and reputation could be negatively impacted.
finally, we are a parent company with limited business operations of our own. we conduct most of our business operations through our direct and indirect subsidiaries. accordingly, we receive cash from royalties, dividends and distributions that are derived from the earnings and cash flow generated by our subsidiaries. our subsidiaries' payments to us will be contingent upon their earnings and upon other business considerations, which may be impacted by various factors, including compliance with certain local statutes, the laws and regulations currently and in the future applicable to our subsidiaries and restrictions in connection with their contractual arrangements. for instance, while currently there are no foreign exchange or capital control restrictions applicable to intercompany transactions between us and mgm china, we cannot assure you that this will continue to be the case in the future and that our ability to convert large amounts of hong kong dollars into u.s. dollars over a relatively short period will not be limited. if, in the future, foreign exchange or capital control restrictions or other restrictions on mgm china's ability to pay dividends were to be imposed and become applicable to us, such restrictions could potentially reduce or eliminate the amounts that we would be able to receive from mgm china, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
in addition, since we expect a significant number of customers to come to mgm macau and mgm cotai (and, to a lesser extent, our domestic properties) from mainland china, general economic, regulatory, geopolitical and market conditions in china could impact our financial prospects. any slowdown in economic growth or changes to china's current restrictions on currency conversion or movements, including market impacts resulting from china's anti-corruption campaign and related tightening of liquidity provided by non-bank lending entities and cross-border currency monitoring (including increased restrictions on union pay withdrawals and other atm limits on the withdrawal of patacas and facial recognition technology on atm machines in macau to strictly enforce the "know your customer" regulations for mainland chinese bank cardholders), could disrupt the number of visitors from mainland china and/or the amounts they are willing to spend at our properties. in addition, any potential policy changes which may affect cross-border travel, similar to the previous travel restrictions during the covid-19 pandemic, could have an adverse impact on visitation from mainland china. it is unclear whether these and other measures will continue to be in effect, become more restrictive, or be readopted in the future. these developments have had, and any future policy developments that may be implemented may have, the effect of reducing the number of visitors to macau from mainland china, which could adversely impact tourism and the gaming industry in macau.
furthermore, our operations in macau may be impacted by competition for limited labor resources and our ability to retain and hire employees. we compete with a large number of casino properties for a limited number of employees and we anticipate that such competition, which significantly increased following the easing of covid-19 restrictions in early 2023, will continue in macau. while we seek employees from outside of macau to adequately staff our properties, certain macau government policies limit our ability to import labor in certain job classifications (for instance, the macau government requires that we only hire macau residents as dealers in our casinos) and any future government policies that freeze or cancel our ability to import labor could cause labor costs to increase. finally, because additional gaming or non-gaming projects have commenced operations and other projects are under construction, the existing transportation infrastructure may need to be expanded to accommodate increased visitation to macau. if transportation facilities to and from macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of customers visiting macau, the desirability of macau as a travel destination, as well as the results of operations at our developments in macau, could be negatively impacted.
we have suspended our payment of ongoing regular dividends to our stockholders, and may not elect to resume paying dividends in the foreseeable future or at all. on february 8, 2023, we announced that our board of directors had determined to suspend our ongoing regular dividends in order to focus on our preferred method of returning value to shareholders through our share repurchase plan. our future resumption of dividend payments, if any, would be subject to the sole discretion of our board of directors, and our ability to pay any dividends in the future could be limited by a variety of factors, including our holding company structure, existing and future debt agreements entered into by us or our subsidiaries, state law requirements, our future liquidity position, potential alternative uses of cash, general economic conditions and expected future financial results, in addition to other factors, some of which may be beyond our control. accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will resume paying dividends in the foreseeable future or at all, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
all of our domestic gaming facilities are leased and could experience risks associated with leased property, including risks relating to lease termination, lease extensions, charges and our relationship with the lessor, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. all of our domestic properties are subject to triple-net leases that, in addition to rent, require us to pay: (1) all facility maintenance, (2) all insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties, (3) taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties (other than taxes on the income of the lessor), (4) all capital expenditures, and (5) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties. we are responsible for paying these expenses notwithstanding the fact that many of the benefits received in exchange for such costs shall accrue in part to the landlords as the owners of the associated facilities. furthermore, our obligation to pay rent as well as the other costs described above is absolute in virtually all circumstances, regardless of the performance of the properties and other circumstances that might abate rent in leases that now place these risks on the tenant, such as certain events of casualty and condemnation. finally, our leases limit our ability to cease operations at our properties, subject to certain limited exceptions.
because a significant number of our major gaming resorts are concentrated on the las vegas strip, we are subject to greater risks than a gaming company that is more geographically diversified. given that a significant number of our major resorts are concentrated on the las vegas strip, our business may be significantly affected by risks common to the las vegas tourism industry. for example, the cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events that disrupt air travel to and from las vegas can adversely affect our business. we cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or from las vegas, but we rely on air traffic for a significant portion of our visitors. reductions in flights by major airlines as a result of higher fuel prices, lower demand, or otherwise, can impact the number of visitors to our properties. additionally, there is one principal interstate highway between las vegas and southern california, where a large number of our customers reside. capacity constraints of that highway or any other traffic disruptions may also affect the number of customers who visit our facilities.
we extend credit to a large portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables. we conduct a portion of our gaming activities on a credit basis through the issuance of markers which are unsecured instruments. table games players typically are issued more markers than slot players, and high-end players typically are issued more markers than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts. high-end gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming, and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter. furthermore, the loss or a reduction in the play of the most significant of these high-end customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we issue markers to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant, in the opinion of management, an extension of credit. uncollectible receivables from high-end customers could have a significant impact on our results of operations.
while gaming debts evidenced by markers and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of nevada, and nevada judgments on gaming debts are enforceable in all states under the full faith and credit clause of the u.s. constitution, other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy. although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the u.s. of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from united states courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations.
furthermore, we expect that mgm grand paradise will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions, including macau. to the extent mgm grand paradise gaming customers are from other jurisdictions, mgm grand paradise may not have access to a forum in which it will be able to collect all of its gaming receivables because, among other reasons, courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and mgm grand paradise may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts. moreover, under applicable law, mgm grand paradise remains obligated to pay taxes on uncollectible winnings from customers.
even where gaming debts are enforceable, they may not be collectible. our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results.
we may incur impairments to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets which could negatively affect our future profits. we review our goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets on an annual basis and during interim reporting periods in accordance with the authoritative guidance. significant negative trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates or lack of growth have resulted in write-downs and impairment charges in the past and, if one or more of such events occurs in the future, additional impairment charges or write-downs may be required in future periods. if we are required to record additional impairment charges or write-downs, this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations.
leisure and business travel, especially travel by air, are particularly susceptible to global geopolitical events, such as terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or acts of war or hostility or the outbreak of infectious diseases. we are dependent on the willingness of our customers to travel by air. since most of our customers travel by air to our las vegas and macau properties, any terrorist act or other acts of violence, outbreak of hostilities, escalation of war, or any actual or perceived threat to the security of travel by air, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. in addition, the outbreak of infectious diseases, such as covid-19, may severely disrupt domestic and international travel.
furthermore, although we have been able to purchase some insurance coverage for certain types of terrorist acts, insurance coverage against physical loss or business interruption resulting from war and some forms of terrorism continues to be unavailable.
co-investing in properties or businesses, including our investment in betmgm, decreases our ability to manage risk. in addition to acquiring or developing hotels and resorts or acquiring companies that complement our business directly, we have from time to time invested, and expect to continue to invest, in properties or businesses as a co-investor. co-investors often have shared control over the operation of the property or business. therefore, the operation of such properties or businesses is subject to inherent risk due to the shared nature of the enterprise and the need to reach agreements on material matters. furthermore, the occurrence of risks that adversely affect the businesses of our joint ventures or other unconsolidated affiliates could reduce the value of our investments in such entities, impair their ability to make any potential future distributions to us or require that we make additional capital contributions to them. the shared nature of control over such ventures may limit our ability to directly manage these risks.
in addition, investments with other investors may involve risks such as the possibility that the co-investor might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet its obligations, or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives. consequently, actions by a co-investor might subject the properties or businesses owned by such entities to additional risk. further, we may be unable to take action without the approval of our co-investors, or our co-investors could take actions binding on the property without our consent. additionally, should a co-investor become bankrupt, we could become liable for its share of liabilities.
for example, we share control of betmgm with our venture partner, entain plc ("entain"), with all major operating, investing and financial activities requiring the consent of both members. disagreements between us and entain could arise in the future, including with respect to the amount and timing of capital contributions. if we and entain are unable to support the future funding of betmgm, then betmgm may not have the resources to execute on the development or implementation of its strategies, including funding efforts to increase its market share, which could result in us not receiving the anticipated benefits from our investment. finally, we were awarded a concession to develop an integrated casino resort in japan in a consortium with orix and other local investors, subject to our receipt of a casino license to operate the same. as a result, we could be subject to additional risks related to being unable to directly control development activities or the timing of development completion, which may impact our ability to complete the project on our anticipated timeline, or at all, or within the agreed upon specifications.
any of our future construction, development or expansion projects will be subject to significant development and construction risks, which could have a material adverse impact on related project timetables, costs and our ability to complete the projects. although our business model is primarily asset-light, we intend to continue to evaluate opportunities for future construction, development or expansion projects. any of our future construction, development or expansion projects, such as our proposed integrated resort in japan and the potential for full-scale commercial gaming at empire city, will be subject to a number of risks, including:
•lack of sufficient, or delays in the availability of, financing;
•changes to plans and specifications;
•engineering problems, including defective plans and specifications;
•shortages of, and price increases in, energy, materials and skilled and unskilled labor;
•pricing inflation, including wage inflation, in key supply markets;
•delays in obtaining or inability to obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals;
•changes in laws and regulations, or in the interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations, applicable to gaming, leisure, residential, real estate development or construction projects;
•labor disputes or work stoppages;
•availability of qualified contractors and subcontractors;
•disputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors;
•personal injuries to workers and other persons;
•environmental, health and safety issues, including site accidents and the spread of viruses;
•weather interferences or delays;
•fires, typhoons and other natural disasters;
•geological, construction, excavation, regulatory and equipment problems; and
•other unanticipated circumstances or cost increases.
the occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs, delay or prevent the construction, development, expansion or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of any future projects which we might undertake. in addition, the regulatory approvals associated with our development projects may require us to open future casino properties by a certain specified time and to the extent we are unable to meet those deadlines, and any such deadlines are not extended, we may lose our regulatory approval to open a casino resort in a proposed jurisdiction, or incur payment penalties in connection with any delays which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we also make significant capital expenditures to maintain and upgrade our properties, which may disrupt operations and displace revenue at the properties, including revenue lost while rooms, restaurants and meeting spaces are under renovation and out of service.
our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer. in addition, our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future. although we have "all risk" property insurance coverage for our operating properties, which covers damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, or terrorism or other acts of violence), each policy has certain exclusions. in addition, our property insurance coverage is in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding the facilities if there was a total loss. our level of insurance coverage also may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty. in addition, certain casualty events, such as labor strikes, nuclear events, acts of war, loss of income due to cancellation of room reservations or conventions due to fear of terrorism or other acts of violence, loss of electrical power due to catastrophic or other events, rolling blackouts or otherwise, deterioration or corrosion, insect or animal damage, and pollution, may not be covered at all under our policies. therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses.
in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss, we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed. while we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance, this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in any such event. furthermore, our leases covering the mgm grand las vegas & mandalay bay, bellagio, aria & vdara, and the cosmopolitan all require us to maintain specified insurance coverage. we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to obtain the types and limits of insurance coverage required by these leases and, to the extent such required insurance coverage cannot be obtained at commercially reasonable cost or at all, then we would need to obtain amendments to the leases or face a default by the applicable tenant under the lease, which could have material adverse effect on our business.
we renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. the cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits, further increase our deductibles or self-insured retentions, or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.
any failure to protect our intellectual property could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business. the development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy, and we regard our intellectual property to be an important element of our success. while our business as a whole is not substantially dependent on any one trademark or combination of several of our trademarks or other intellectual property, we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our business operations through the use of trade secrets, trademarks, domain names, copyright, and by seeking and enforcing legal protections under contract law and other laws and regulations related to the foregoing. we file applications for, and obtain trademarks in, the united states and in foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, parties may infringe our trademarks and other intellectual property and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable. for example, while we have a policy of entering into agreements with (or imposing other restrictions on) our employees, independent contracts, and business partners addressing confidentiality, intellectual property assignment, and non-competition and non-solicitation issues, such agreements may not provide adequate protection or may be breached, or our proprietary information may otherwise become available to or be independently developed by our competitors. the laws of some foreign countries also may not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states. monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult.
certain of our technology also contains software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under "open-source" licenses. use and distribution of open-source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open-source licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. in addition, the public availability of such software may make it easier for others to compromise our technology and, under certain open-source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. this would allow our competitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of our competitive advantages.
third parties have alleged and may in the future allege that we are infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights. third parties may initiate litigation against us without warning or may send us letters or other communications that make allegations without initiating litigation. we may elect not to respond to these letters or other communications if we believe they are without merit, or we may attempt to resolve these disputes out of court by negotiating a license, but in either case it is possible that such disputes will ultimately result in litigation. any such claims could interfere with our ability to use technology or intellectual property that is material to the operation of our business. such claims may be made by competitors seeking to obtain a competitive advantage or by other parties, such as entities that purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of bringing infringement claims. we also periodically employ individuals who were previously employed by our competitors or potential competitors, and we may therefore be subject to claims that such employees have used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers.
we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity, including with respect to technology that we believe to be "open-source". any such litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and the attention of management. if unsuccessful, such litigation could result in the loss of important intellectual property rights, require us to pay substantial damages, subject us to injunctions that prevent us from using certain intellectual property, require us to make admissions that affect our reputation in the marketplace, or require us to enter into license agreements that may not be available on favorable terms, re-engineer our technology or discontinue or delay the provision of our offerings. finally, even if we prevail in any litigation, the remedy may not be commercially meaningful or fully compensate us for the harm we suffer or the costs we incur. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
a significant portion of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements. work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively affect our business and results of operations. as of december 31, 2023, approximately 37,000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. a prolonged dispute with the covered employees or any labor unrest, strikes or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations or otherwise could have an adverse impact on our operations, and adverse publicity in the marketplace related to union messaging could further harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services. also, wage and/or benefit increases resulting from new labor agreements may be significant and could also have an adverse impact on our results of operations. to the extent that our non-union employees seek union representation or elect union representation, we would have exposure to risks associated with representation proceedings, labor negotiations and/or economic impacts of newly negotiated labor agreements. furthermore, we may have, or acquire in the future, multi-employer plans that are classified as "endangered," "seriously endangered," or "critical" status. for instance, borgata's most significant plan is the legacy plan of the unite here retirement fund, which has been listed in "critical status" and is subject to a rehabilitation plan. plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, which may require additional contributions from employers (which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions) and/or modifications to retiree benefits. in addition, while borgata has no current intention to withdraw from these plans, a withdrawal in the future could result in the incurrence of a contingent liability that would be payable in an amount and at such time (or over a period of time) that would vary based on a number of factors at the time of (and after) withdrawal. any such additional costs may be significant.
our business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results. we are a large consumer of electricity and other energy and, therefore, higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. accordingly, increases in energy costs may have a negative impact on our operating results. additionally, higher electricity and gasoline prices that affect our customers may result in reduced visitation to our properties and a reduction in our revenues.
we may seek to expand through investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances or acquisitions, and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets, any of which may be unsuccessful. we intend to consider strategic and complementary acquisitions and investments in other businesses, properties or other assets. furthermore, we may pursue any of these opportunities with third parties. acquisitions and investments in businesses, properties or assets, by us or together with third parties, are subject to risks that could affect our business, including risks related to:
•spending cash and incurring debt;
•assuming contingent liabilities;
•unanticipated issues in integrating information, communications and other systems;
•unanticipated incompatibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing and administration methods;
•retaining key employees; and
•consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures.
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. in addition, even if we are able to identify any such opportunities and complete transactions, we cannot assure you that we will realize the anticipated synergies and benefits of our acquisitions or that they will be accretive to our results of operations. our estimates and assumptions regarding expected synergies and benefits of our acquisitions could materially change, including as a result of factors beyond our control, and could delay, decrease or eliminate the expected accretive effect of the acquisitions. in addition, even if we are able to successfully integrate new assets and businesses, the integration of such assets and businesses may result in unanticipated costs, competitive responses, loss of customer or other business relationships and the diversion of management attention, and the expansion of our operations in general, whether through acquisition, development or internal growth, could also cause us to incur substantial costs, including legal, professional and consulting fees.
in addition, we periodically review our business to identify properties or other assets that we believe either are non-core, no longer complement our business, are in markets which may not benefit us as much as other markets or could be sold at significant premiums. from time to time, we may attempt to sell these identified properties and assets. there can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to complete dispositions on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
the failure to maintain the integrity of our information and other systems or customer information can result in damage to our reputation, subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits and restrictions on our use of data, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we collect and process information relating to our employees, guests, and others for various business purposes, including marketing and promotional purposes. the collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted by the various states, the united states and other jurisdictions around the world. privacy laws and regulations continue to evolve and on occasion may be inconsistent (or conflict) between jurisdictions. various federal, state and foreign legislative or regulatory bodies may enact or adopt new or additional laws and regulations concerning privacy, data retention, data transfer, and data protection. for example, california has a comprehensive privacy law, known as the california consumer privacy act of 2018 ("ccpa"), which provides some of the strongest privacy requirements in the united states. the ccpa was amended by the california privacy rights act that went into effect in 2023. in addition, new privacy requirements went into effect in 2023 in colorado, connecticut, utah, and virginia. outside the united states, the european union has adopted a data protection regulation known as the general data protection regulation that provides data subjects with significant privacy-related rights and imposes operational and compliance requirements on organizations with significant penalties for non-compliance. other jurisdictions including canada and china have also amended or adopted new privacy laws and/or requirements which often include similar requirements and obligations. there may be risks and uncertainties associated with these and other privacy laws and regulations including their interpretation and implementation, as well as the potential extraterritorial effect of certain privacy laws and regulations.
compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations increases our operating costs and could adversely impact our ability to market our products, properties and services to our guests. in addition, non-compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-compliance by third parties engaged by us), including accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, unapproved dissemination or a breach of security on systems storing our customer data can result in damage to our reputation, subject us to investigations, fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. we rely on proprietary and commercially available systems, software, and tools to provide security for processing of customer and employee information, such as payment card and other confidential or proprietary information. our data security measures are reviewed and evaluated regularly; however, they might not protect us against increasingly sophisticated and aggressive threats, like the cybersecurity issue that affected us in september 2023, as further described below.
we also rely extensively on our information and other systems and those of third parties to process transactions, maintain and communicate information, and manage our businesses, including at our properties and on our website and digital platforms. disruptions in these systems, through cyber-attacks or otherwise, have in the past and can in the future be expected to impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. this can occur notwithstanding the data security measures and disaster recovery plans that we have in place. further, our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all possible scenarios that we may encounter.
there has been an increase in criminal cybersecurity attacks against companies (and third-party service providers) where systems have been breached, businesses disrupted, and customer, employee, and other company information has been compromised or destroyed. our systems and data, including those we maintain with our third-party service providers, have been subject to cybersecurity breaches of varying degrees of severity in the past and are expected to be subject to cybersecurity breaches in the future.
our third-party information system and other service providers face risks relating to cybersecurity similar to ours, and we do not directly control any of such parties' information security or other operations. a significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer or company data maintained by us or by a third-party service provider could have an adverse effect on our reputation, cause a material disruption to our operations, and result in remediation expenses, regulatory penalties and litigation by customers and other parties whose information was subject to such attacks, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.
while we maintain cybersecurity insurance to assist in the cost of recovery from a significant cyber event, such coverage may not be sufficient to cover any losses resulting from such incidents. a cybersecurity incident also could require that we expend significant additional resources on remediation, restoration, and enhancement of our information technology and other systems.
by way of example, in september 2023, we experienced a cybersecurity issue affecting certain of our systems, in which criminal actors obtained certain personal information of some of our customers (the "cybersecurity issue"). among other things, this issue resulted in system shutdowns that created operational disruptions at our domestic properties, adversely affected revenues, and is subjecting us to litigation, investigations, and potential regulatory penalties or other remedies. for more information, see "cybersecurity issue" in part ii, item 7 - "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" as well as "cybersecurity litigation, claims, and investigations" in part ii, item 8, note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
we are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility and reputation. many factors influence our reputation and the value of our brands including the perception held by our customers, business partners, other key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business. our business faces increasing scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance factors and risk of damage to our reputation and the value of our brands if we fail to act responsibly in several areas including diversity and inclusion, community engagement and philanthropy, environmental sustainability, plastic pollution, climate change, responsible gaming, supply chain management, workplace conduct, human rights, and many others, some of which may be unforeseen. any harm to our reputation could further impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.
we are subject to risks and costs related to climate change. extreme weather conditions, potentially exacerbated by climate change, may cause property damage or interrupt business, which could harm our business and results of operations. certain of our properties are located in areas that may be subject to extreme weather conditions, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, floods, tornados, wildfires, and winter storms in the united states and severe typhoons in macau. such extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations or the operations of critical suppliers, damage our properties, and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in such areas. in addition, our operations or the operations of critical suppliers could be adversely impacted by a drought or other cause of water stress or shortage. a severe drought of extensive duration experienced in las vegas or in the other regions in which we operate or source critical supplies could adversely affect our business. although we maintain both property and business interruption insurance coverage for certain extreme weather conditions, such coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits, including limitation on the coverage period for business interruption, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect, if at all, on claims resulting from such extreme weather conditions.
furthermore, such extreme weather conditions may result in reduced availability or increased price volatility of certain critical supplies, may interrupt or impede access to our affected properties, and may cause visits to our affected properties to decrease for an indefinite period. additionally, many states and municipalities have begun to adopt laws and policies on climate change and emission reduction targets. changes in federal, state, and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in increased regulatory costs, which may include capital expenditures on our existing properties to ensure compliance with any new or updated regulations, which may potentially adversely affect our operations. there can be no assurance that the potential impacts of climate change and severe weather will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, results of operations, cash flows or business.
water scarcity could negatively impact our operations. water is critical to the prosperity of the communities we serve and the ecosystems in which we operate. water is also a limited resource in many parts of the world, including las vegas where the majority of our properties are located. water availability is facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation, the effects of climate change, and increasing demand for food and other consumer and industrial products whose manufacturing processes require water. as the demand for water continues to increase in the areas in which we operate, and as water becomes scarcer and the quality of available water deteriorates, our operations may incur higher costs or face capacity constraints and the possibility of reputational damage, which could adversely affect our profitability.
risks related to legal and regulatory matters and changes in public policy our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations. our ownership and operation of gaming operations is subject to extensive regulation by the countries, states and provinces in which we operate. these laws, regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations. as such, our gaming regulators can require us to disassociate ourselves from suppliers or business partners found unsuitable by the regulators or, alternatively, cease operations in that jurisdiction. in addition, unsuitable activity on our part or on the part of our domestic or foreign unconsolidated affiliates or subsidiaries in any jurisdiction could have a negative effect on our ability to continue operating in other jurisdictions. the regulatory environment in any particular jurisdiction may change in the future and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. furthermore, our igaming and online sports betting initiatives may be particularly subject to risks related to potential changes in the regulatory and enforcement environment as a result of the continued development of regulatory schemes in this industry in the u.s. and internationally. for a summary of gaming and other regulations that affect our business, see "regulation and licensing" and exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on form 10-k.
further, our directors, officers, key employees and investors in our properties and igaming and online sports betting initiatives must meet approval standards of certain state and foreign regulatory authorities. if such regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuitable, we would be required to sever our relationship with that person or the investor may be required to dispose of his, her or its interest. regulatory authorities may also conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors, officers, key employees or investors to ensure compliance with applicable standards. certain public and private issuances of securities, borrowings under credit agreements, guarantees of indebtedness and other transactions also require the approval of certain regulatory authorities.
macau laws and regulations concerning gaming and gaming concessions are complex, and a court or administrative or regulatory body may in the future render an interpretation of these laws and regulations, or issue new or modified regulations, that differ from mgm china's interpretation, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, mgm grand paradise's activities in macau are subject to administrative review and approval by various government agencies. we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to obtain all necessary approvals, and any such failure to do so may materially affect its long-term business strategy and operations. macau laws permit redress to the courts with respect to administrative actions; however, to date such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues.
in addition to gaming regulations, we are also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general. these laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, smoking, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. for instance, we are subject to certain federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, including the clean air act, the clean water act, the resource conservation recovery act, the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act, the energy policy act, the safe drinking water act, renewable portfolio standards, the oil pollution act of 1990, and many others. under various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible for, the presence of such substances or wastes. such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. there has been increasing focus from international, national, and state regulators on reporting and reducing ghg emissions and other climate change-related topics, such as climate-related disclosure rules proposed by the sec. these regulations could impose stricter standards on operations and reporting which could be costly and difficult to implement. in addition, effective since january 1, 2019, smoking in casinos in macau, including mgm macau and mgm cotai, is only permitted inside specially ventilated smoking rooms, rather than outside smoking areas or vip areas. the likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted, though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance.
we also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to recordkeeping and reporting obligations as required by various anti-money laundering laws and regulations. for instance, in the united states, we are subject to regulation under the currency and foreign transactions reporting act of 1970, commonly known as the "bank secrecy act", which, among other things, requires us to report to the internal revenue service ("irs") any currency transactions in excess of $10,000 that occur within a 24-hour gaming day, including identification of the individual(s) involved in the currency transaction. we are also required to report suspicious activity where we know, suspect or have reason to suspect transactions, among other things, involve funds from illegal activity or are intended to evade federal regulations or avoid reporting requirements or have no business or lawful purpose. in addition, under the bank secrecy act and similar laws in other jurisdictions, we are subject to various other rules and regulations involving reporting, recordkeeping and retention. our compliance with anti-money laundering regulations, including the bank secrecy act, is subject to periodic examinations by the relevant regulatory agencies in each jurisdiction where we operate. any such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. any violations of the anti-money laundering laws, including the bank secrecy act, or regulations by any of our properties, businesses, customers, or employees could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
any violation of the foreign corrupt practices act or any other similar anti-corruption laws could have a negative impact on us. historically, a significant portion of our revenue was derived from operations outside the united states, which exposes us to complex foreign and u.s. regulations inherent in doing cross-border business and in each of the countries in which we transact business. we are subject to compliance with the united states foreign corrupt practices act ("fcpa") and other similar anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. while our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. violations of these laws by us or our non-controlled ventures may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties against us, and the sec and u.s. department of justice continue to vigorously pursue enforcement of the fcpa. the occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.
if the jurisdictions in which we operate increase taxes and fees, including gaming taxes, our results could be adversely affected. federal, state and local authorities domestically and internationally raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees, including taxes and fees on gaming activities. from time to time, legislators and government officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. periods of economic downturn or uncertainty and budget deficits may intensify such efforts to raise revenues through increases in taxes, the imposition of new taxes or changes to tax laws that result in higher taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law or interpretation. if the jurisdictions in which we operate were to increase taxes, impose new taxes or change existing tax laws, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
the future recognition of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is uncertain, and the amount of valuation allowance we may apply against such deferred tax asset may change materially in future periods. we currently have significant deferred tax assets resulting from foreign tax credit carryforwards that are available to potentially reduce taxes attributable to taxable foreign-sourced income in future periods. we evaluate our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset for recoverability and record a valuation allowance to the extent we determine it is not more likely than not such asset will be recovered. this evaluation is based upon all available evidence, including assumptions concerning future u.s. operating profits and foreign source income. as a result, significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a valuation allowance and changes to our assumptions could result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on the provision for income taxes in the period including such change.
we face risks related to pending claims that have been, or future claims that may be, brought against us. claims have been brought against us and our subsidiaries in various legal proceedings, and additional legal and tax claims arise from time to time. we may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of our current or future legal proceedings, which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation. please see the further discussion in "legal proceedings" and note 12 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
risks related to our macau operations we have agreed not to have any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in china, macau, hong kong and taiwan, other than through mgm china. in connection with the gaming concession, we entered into a third renewed deed of non-compete undertakings with mgm china and ms. ho, pansy catilina chiu king ("ms. ho"), pursuant to which we are restricted from having any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in the people's republic of china, macau, hong kong and taiwan, other than through mgm china. while gaming is currently prohibited in china, hong kong and taiwan, if it is legalized in the future our ability to compete in these locations could be limited until the earliest of (i) the date mgm china's ordinary shares cease to be listed on the stock exchange of hong kong limited or (ii) the last day of mgm grand paradise's concession for operation of casino games (or any extension thereof); or (iii) the date when our ownership of mgm china shares is less than 15% of the then-issued share capital of mgm china.
the macau government can (i) terminate mgm grand paradise's concession under certain circumstances without compensating mgm grand paradise, (ii) from the eighth year of mgm grand paradise's concession, redeem the concession by providing mgm grand paradise at least one year's prior notice and subject to the payment of reasonable and fair damages or indemnity to mgm grand paradise, or (iii) refuse to grant mgm grand paradise an extension of the concession prior to its expiry. the macau government has the right to unilaterally terminate the concession for endangering the national security of china or macau by mgm grand paradise, failure of mgm grand paradise to perform its obligations, for the public interest or lack of appropriate qualifications of mgm grand paradise under the gaming law. from the eighth year of mgm grand paradise's concession, the macau government may redeem the concession by providing mgm grand paradise with at least one year of advance notice. in the event the macau government exercises this redemption right, mgm grand paradise is entitled to reasonable and fair damages or indemnity. upon such termination, all of mgm grand paradise's casino area premises and gaming-related equipment, with the exception of those which have been temporarily transferred to mgm grand paradise by the macau government for use in accordance with the concession contract, would be transferred automatically to the macau government without compensation to mgm grand paradise, and we would cease to generate any revenues from these operations. we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will perform all of its obligations under the concession contract in a way that satisfies the requirements of the macau government.
under the terms of mgm grand paradise's concession, mgm grand paradise is required to implement certain investments in gaming and non-gaming projects, for which the non-gaming commitment is subject to increase if market-wide macau annual gross gaming revenue reaches a specified level, as further discussed in note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. there can be no assurance, however, that mgm grand paradise will have sufficient cash on hand to fund these obligations, or that it will be able to obtain financing to fund these obligations on satisfactory terms or at all. if mgm grand paradise is unable to satisfy its investment commitments, its concession contract may be subject to termination by the macau government.
furthermore, under the concession contract, mgm grand paradise is obligated to comply with any laws and regulations that the macau government might promulgate in the future. we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to comply with these laws and regulations or other requirements of mgm grand paradise's concession contract, or that these laws and regulations or other requirements would not adversely affect our ability to construct or operate our macau businesses. if any disagreement arises between mgm grand paradise and the macau government regarding the interpretation of, or mgm grand paradise's compliance with, a provision of the concession contract, mgm grand paradise will be relying on a consultation and negotiation process with the macau government. during any consultation or negotiation, mgm grand paradise will be obligated to comply with the terms of the concession contract as interpreted by the macau government. currently, there is no precedent concerning how the macau government will treat the termination of a concession upon the occurrence of any of the circumstances mentioned above. the loss of the concession would require us to cease conducting gaming operations in macau, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
in addition, the concession contract expires on december 31, 2032. we cannot assure you that mgm grand paradise will be able to obtain an extension of the concession contract upon its expiration or be awarded a new gaming concession on terms favorable to mgm grand paradise or at all. we cannot provide any assurances on the terms associated with any potential future extension, which could include additional fees or other financial commitments that may have an adverse impact on the financial position of mgm grand paradise. we also cannot assure you that if the concession is redeemed by the macau government, the compensation paid to mgm grand paradise will be adequate to compensate for the loss of future revenues.
we are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the united states. our operations outside of the united states are subject to risks that are inherent in conducting business under non-united states laws, regulations and customs. in particular, the risks associated with the operation of mgm china or any future operations in which we may engage in any other foreign territories, include:
•changes in laws and policies that govern operations of companies in macau or other foreign jurisdictions;
•changes in non-united states government programs;
•changes in laws or regulations restricting the ability of our non u.s. subsidiaries to make distributions or declare dividends;
•possible failure by our employees or agents to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions;
•general economic conditions and policies in china, including restrictions on travel and currency movements;
•difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing non-united states operations;
•different labor regulations;
•changes in environmental, health and safety laws;
•outbreaks of diseases or epidemics, including the covid-19 pandemic;
•potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;
•political instability and actual or anticipated military and political conflicts;
•economic instability and inflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations; and
•uncertainties regarding judicial systems and procedures.
these risks, individually or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we are also exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. if the united states dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of other countries, our united states dollar reported income from sources where revenue is denominated in the currencies of other such countries will decrease.
conflicts of interest may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also directors of mgm china, the holding company for mgm grand paradise which owns and operates mgm macau and mgm cotai. as a result of the initial public offering of shares of mgm china common stock in 2011, mgm china has stockholders who are not affiliated with us, and we and certain of our officers and directors who also serve as officers and/or directors of mgm china may have conflicting fiduciary obligations to our stockholders and to the minority stockholders of mgm china. decisions that could have different implications for us and mgm china, including contractual arrangements that we have entered into or may in the future enter into with mgm china, may give rise to the appearance of a potential conflict of interest or an actual conflict of interest.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes discussion as of and for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to december 31, 2022. discussion of our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to december 31, 2021 can be found in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2022, filed with the securities and exchange commission ("sec") on february 24, 2023.
overview our primary business is the operation of casino properties, which offer gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment, retail and other resort amenities. we lease the real estate assets of our domestic properties pursuant to triple-net lease agreements.
our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature, though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period, including the timing of major conventions, far east baccarat volumes, the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our high-end gaming customers, and the level of play during major holidays, including new year and lunar new year. while our results do not depend on key individual customers, a significant portion of our operating income is generated from high-end gaming customers, which can cause variability in our results. in addition, our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers and the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or high-end gaming customers from a specific country or region can affect our results. our results will also depend upon our ability to expand our ownership, management and operation of gaming facilities and accessing new markets for igaming and online sports betting.
our results are also affected by significant recent developments in our business, which principally consist of transactions we have executed in furtherance of our businesses strategy and the recovery from the covid-19 pandemic, including the removal of covid-19 travel restrictions in macau and mainland china, as described in further detail below.
overview of strategic business developments
•in july 2018, we and entain formed betmgm. in connection with its formation, we provided betmgm with exclusive access to all of our domestic land based and online sports betting, major tournament poker, and online gaming operations, and entain provided betmgm with exclusive access to its technology in the united states.
•on september 28, 2021, we announced that we and orix were selected by osaka as the region's integrated resort partner. in december 2021, we and orix formed a venture, osaka ir kk, through which we plan to develop the integrated resort. on april 27, 2022, we, together with osaka prefecture/city, osaka ir kk, and orix, submitted an adp to japan's central government. on april 14, 2023, we announced that the japanese government officially certified the adp, and, in september 2023, osaka ir kk signed an agreement with osaka to implement the adp.
•on april 29, 2022, vici acquired mgm growth properties llc ("mgp") in a stock-for-stock transaction (such transaction, the "vici transaction"). mgp class a shareholders received 1.366 shares of newly issued vici stock in exchange for each mgp class a share outstanding and we received 1.366 units of vici properties op llc ("vici op") in exchange for each mgm growth properties operating partnership lp ("mgp op") unit held by us. in connection with the exchange, vici op redeemed the majority of our vici op units, with us retaining an approximate 1% ownership interest in vici op. mgp's class b share that was held by us was cancelled. accordingly, we no longer hold a controlling interest in mgp and deconsolidated mgp upon the closing of the transaction. in connection with the vici transaction, we entered into an amended and restated master lease with vici. see note 4 and note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the transaction and lease, respectively.
•on may 17, 2022, we acquired the operations of the cosmopolitan for cash consideration of $1.625 billion, plus working capital adjustments, for a total purchase price of approximately $1.7 billion. additionally, we entered into a lease agreement for the real estate assets of the cosmopolitan. see note 4 and note 11 for discussion of the transaction and lease, respectively.
•in june 2022, the macau government enacted a new gaming law that provides for material changes to the legal form of gaming concessions in macau, including discontinuing and prohibiting gaming subconcessions subsequent to their expiration, and also includes material changes to the rights and obligations provided for under the new gaming concessions that were awarded in the public tender that concluded in december 2022, such as limiting the term of concessions to a maximum of 10 years. as a result, we reassessed the useful life of the mgm grand paradise gaming subconcession intangible asset and reduced the useful life to align with the contractual term of the subconcession, which expired on december 31, 2022, thereby accelerating the recognition of amortization within our statements of operations. see note 7 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion. in december 2022, we were awarded a new gaming concession, which permits the operation of games of chance or other games in casinos in macau, commencing on january 1, 2023.

•in august 2023, leovegas completed the acquisition of the majority ownership of push gaming, a digital gaming developer.
cybersecurity issue in september 2023, we identified a cybersecurity issue involving unauthorized access to certain of our u.s. systems by criminal actors. upon discovery of the cybersecurity issue, we shut down certain systems to mitigate risk to customer information, which resulted in operational disruptions at our domestic properties during the third quarter of 2023. based on our investigation, we believe that the unauthorized activity has been contained. we determined that the criminal actors obtained, for some of our customers, personal information (including name, contact information (such as phone number, email address and postal address), gender, date of birth and driver's license numbers). for a limited number of customers, social security numbers and passport numbers were also obtained by the criminal actors. the types of impacted information varied by individual. at this time, we do not believe that customer passwords, bank account numbers or payment card information were obtained by the criminal actors.
in connection with the cybersecurity issue, we became subject to consumer class actions and state and federal regulatory inquiries to which we intend to respond to in due course. however, we cannot predict the timing or outcome of any of these potential matters, or whether we may be subject to additional legal proceedings, claims, regulatory inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions as a result.
the cybersecurity issue, together with the incident response efforts discussed above, resulted in some disruptions to our business operations primarily during the third quarter of 2023 and we also incurred expenses for technology consulting services, legal fees and other third-party advisors in connection with this issue during the second half of 2023, which were not material to our 2023 results.
we have incurred, and may continue to incur, certain expenses related to the cybersecurity issue, including expenses to respond to, remediate, and investigate this matter. although we have cybersecurity insurance that we expect will cover these expenses, the full scope of the costs and related impacts of this issue have not been determined. the cybersecurity issue is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
covid-19
the spread of covid-19 and developments surrounding the global pandemic had a significant impact on our business from 2020 through early 2023. domestically, we had temporary closures, re-closures, and re-openings of our properties or portions thereof, as well as operations without certain amenities and subject to certain occupancy limitations, with restrictions varying by jurisdiction. in 2022, all of our domestic properties were open and not subject to operating restrictions; however, travel and business volume were negatively affected in the early part of the first quarter of 2022 due to the spread of the omicron variant.
in macau, travel and entry restrictions, testing and quarantine requirements, as well as temporary closures and suspensions of gaming, hotel, restaurant, and retail operations, significantly impacted visitation to our macau properties from 2020 through early 2023. beginning in december 2022, macau and mainland china started to unwind testing and quarantine requirements as well as travel and entry restrictions associated with the "dynamic zero" covid-19 policy. on january 8, 2023, macau lifted the majority of its covid-19 pandemic travel and quarantine restrictions with the exception of overseas visitors travelling from outside of mainland china, hong kong and taiwan being required to present a negative nucleic acid test or rapid antigen test result, and, on february 6, 2023, all remaining covid-19 travel restrictions were removed.
visitation statistics the las vegas strip segment results of operations are heavily impacted by visitor volume and trends. during the year ended december 31, 2023, las vegas visitor volume increased 5% compared to 2022 according to information published by the las vegas convention and visitors authority. the las vegas market has experienced the expansion of convention center, sporting, music, and entertainment events in the current year, which have positively impacted business and leisure travel.
the mgm china segment results of operations also are heavily impacted by visitor volume and trends. during the year ended december 31, 2023, macau visitor arrivals increased 395% compared to 2022 according to statistics published by the statistics and census service of the macau government, as 2022 was more negatively affected by travel and entry restrictions in macau than in 2023.
key performance indicators key performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue are:
•gaming revenue indicators: table games drop and slots handle (volume indicators); "win" or "hold" percentage, which is not fully controllable by us. our normal table games hold percentage at our las vegas strip resorts is in the range of 25.0% to 35.0% of table games drop for baccarat and 19.0% to 23.0% for non-baccarat; and
•hotel revenue indicators (for las vegas strip resorts): hotel occupancy (a volume indicator); average daily rate ("adr," a price indicator); and revenue per available room ("revpar," a summary measure of hotel results, combining adr and occupancy rate). our calculation of adr, which is the average price of occupied rooms per day, includes the impact of complimentary rooms. complimentary room rates are determined based on standalone selling price. because the mix of rooms provided on a complimentary basis, particularly to casino customers, includes a disproportionate suite component, the composite adr including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the adr for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value of suites. rooms that were out of service during the year ended december 31, 2021 as a result of property closures due to the pandemic were excluded from the available room count when calculating hotel occupancy and revpar.

consolidated operating income increased 31% in 2023 compared to 2022. the increase was due primarily to the increase in net revenues, discussed above, a $2.7 billion decrease in depreciation and amortization expense, and a $399 million gain in the current year period related to the sale of the operations of gold strike tunica recorded in property transactions, net, partially offset by a $2.3 billion gain related to the vici transaction and a $1.1 billion gain on the sale of the operations of the mirage recorded in property transactions, net in 2022, as well as a current year increase in rent expense recorded within general and administrative expense primarily related to the vici and the cosmopolitan leases, which commenced in april 2022 and may 2022, respectively. depreciation and amortization expense decreased compared to 2022 primarily due to $2.5 billion of amortization in 2022 related to the mgm grand paradise gaming subconcession, which became fully amortized in 2022.

gross interest expense was $463 million in 2023 compared to $596 million in 2022. the decrease from 2022 is due primarily to a decrease in debt outstanding as a result of the repayment of the $1.0 billion 7.75% senior notes in march 2022, the derecognition of mgp op's senior notes in connection with the deconsolidation of mgp in april 2022, the repayment of the $1.25 billion 6% senior notes in march 2023, the decrease in the debt outstanding under mgm china's revolving credit facilities, and repayment of the leovegas senior notes in august 2023. see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion on long-term debt and see "liquidity and capital resources" for discussion on issuances and repayments of long-term debt and other sources and uses of cash.

our effective rate for 2023 was favorably impacted primarily by a decrease in the valuation allowance on foreign tax credit carryforwards resulting from a projected increase in foreign source income and favorably impacted by an increase in macau income offset by expiring net operating losses from prior years subject to valuation allowances. these changes were partially offset by an increase in incremental u.s. tax on foreign earnings. our effective rate for 2022 was unfavorably impacted by losses in macau from which we could not benefit and an increase in state deferred tax liabilities as a result of the new jersey income tax regulation issuance, partially offset by a decrease in macau deferred tax liabilities resulting from the acceleration of amortization of the mgm grand paradise gaming subconcession and the extension of the exemption from the macau 12% complementary tax to the end of the year as well as the impact of a decrease in state deferred tax liabilities as a result of the vici transaction.
cash taxes paid increased in 2023 compared to 2022 due to utilization of our remaining overall domestic loss in 2023 prior to fully sheltering 50% of domestic taxable income as well as the payment of taxes in 2023 related to the disposition of the mirage. in addition, cash taxes paid in 2022 were lower due to approximately $80 million in refunds received mainly from claims related to losses incurred in 2020.
reportable segment gaap measure
"adjusted property ebitdar" is our reportable segment gaap measure, which we utilize as the primary profit measure for our reportable segments and underlying operating segments. adjusted property ebitdar is a measure defined as earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net, gain on reit transactions, net, rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases, income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures, and also excludes gain on consolidation of citycenter, net, gain related to citycenter's sale of harmon land recorded within income from unconsolidated affiliates, corporate expense and stock compensation expense, which are not allocated to each operating segment, and rent expense related to the master lease with mgp that eliminated in consolidation. "adjusted property ebitdar margin" is adjusted property ebitdar divided by related segment net revenues.
non-gaap measures
"same-store adjusted property ebitdar" is adjusted property ebitdar further adjusted to exclude the adjusted property ebitdar of acquired operating segments from the date of acquisition through the end of the reporting period and to exclude the adjusted property ebitdar of disposed operating segments from the beginning of the reporting period through the date of disposition. accordingly, for las vegas strip resorts, we have excluded the adjusted property ebitdar of the cosmopolitan for periods subsequent to its acquisition on may 17, 2022, aria for periods subsequent to its acquisition on september 27, 2021, and the mirage for the periods prior to its disposition on december 19, 2022, as applicable. for regional operations, we have excluded the adjusted property ebitdar of gold strike tunica for the periods prior to its disposition on february 15, 2023, as applicable.
same-store adjusted property ebitdar is a non-gaap measure and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported gaap measures because management believes this measure is useful in providing meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the results of our operations for operating segments that were consolidated for the full period presented to assist users of the financial statements in reviewing operating performance over time. same-store adjusted property ebitdar should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance, considered in isolation, or as an alternative to our reportable segment gaap measure or net income, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, because this measure is not presented on a gaap basis, and is provided for the limited purposes discussed herein. in addition, same-store adjusted property ebitdar may not be defined in the same manner by all companies and, as a result, may not be comparable to similarly titled non-gaap financial measures of other companies, and such differences may be material. a reconciliation of our reportable segment adjusted property ebitdar gaap measure to same-store adjusted property ebitdar is included herein.
"adjusted ebitdar" is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net, gain on reit transactions, net, gain on consolidation of citycenter, net, rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases, gain related to citycenter's sale of harmon land recorded within income from unconsolidated affiliates, and income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures.
adjusted ebitdar information is a non-gaap measure that is a valuation metric, should not be used as an operating metric, and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported gaap measures because we believe this measure is widely used by analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors as a principal basis for the valuation of gaming companies. we believe that while items excluded from adjusted ebitdar may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends. also, we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current trends or be indicative of future results. for example, preopening and start-up expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the project(s). property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our properties, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which may not be comparable period over period. in addition, management excludes rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases. management believes excluding rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases provides useful information to analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors when valuing us, as well as comparing our results to other gaming companies, without regard to differences in capital structure and leasing arrangements since the operations of other gaming companies may or may not include triple-net operating leases or ground leases. however, as discussed herein, adjusted ebitdar should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance, an indicator of our performance, considered in isolation, or construed as an alternative to operating income or net income, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because this measure is not presented on a gaap basis and excludes certain expenses, including the rent expense related to our triple-net operating leases and ground leases, and is provided for the limited purposes discussed herein. in addition, other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report adjusted ebitdar may calculate adjusted ebitdar in a different manner and such differences may be material. we have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes, real estate triple-net lease and ground lease payments, and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in adjusted ebitdar. a reconciliation of gaap net income to adjusted ebitdar is included herein.

cash flows operating activities. trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but can be affected by changes in working capital, the timing of significant interest payments, and tax payments or refunds. cash provided by operating activities was $2.7 billion in 2023 compared to $1.8 billion in 2022. the increase from the prior year was due primarily to the increase in adjusted property ebitdar at our las vegas strip resorts and mgm china discussed within the results of operations section above and a decrease in cash paid for interest, partially offset by an increase in triple-net lease rent payments and cash paid for taxes, net.
investing activities. our investing cash flows can fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new or existing properties, business acquisitions or dispositions, and the timing of maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the quality of our properties. capital expenditures related to regular investments in our existing properties can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel rooms.

other factors affecting liquidity and anticipated uses of cash we require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our businesses. in addition to required cash on hand for operations, we utilize corporate cash management procedures to minimize the amount of cash held on hand or in banks. funds are swept from the accounts at most of our domestic properties daily into central bank accounts, and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repay amounts drawn under our revolving credit facilities. in addition, from time to time we may use excess funds to repurchase our outstanding debt and equity securities subject to limitations in our revolving credit facility and delaware law, as applicable. we have significant outstanding debt, interest payments, rent payments, and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures and commitments.
on february 8, 2023, we announced that the board of directors has determined to suspend the ongoing dividends in light of our current preferred method of returning value to shareholders through our share repurchase plan. to the extent we determine to reinstate the dividend in the future, determinations regarding the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our results of operations, financial condition, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.
as of december 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 billion, of which mgm china held $542 million, and we had $6.4 billion in principal amount of indebtedness, including $3.1 billion related to mgm china. no amounts were drawn on our revolving credit facility or mgm china's second revolving credit facility, and as of december 31, 2023, there was $371 million outstanding under mgm china's first revolving credit facility. in june 2023, mgm china amended each of its first revolving credit facility and its second revolving credit facility, which extended the maturity date of each facility to may 2026, increased the amount to which mgm china may upsize its second revolving credit facility, removed the requirement for the mgm china first revolving credit facility to be fully drawn prior to utilizing the mgm china second revolving credit facility, and extended the financial covenant waivers through december 31, 2024. the option to increase the amount of the second revolving facility was partially exercised in 2023, as further discussed in note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. in february 2024, the company amended its senior secured credit facility to increase the facility to $2.3 billion and extend the maturity date to february 2029.
our expected cash interest payments, based on principal amounts of debt outstanding, contractual maturity dates, and interest rates as of december 31, 2023, for 2024, 2025, and 2026 are approximately $185 million, $140 million, and $95 million, respectively, excluding mgm china, and approximately $360 million, $280 million, and $170 million, respectively, on a consolidated basis, which includes mgm china.
we are also required as of december 31, 2023 to make annual contractual cash rent payments of $1.8 billion over the next twelve months under triple-net lease agreements, which triple-net leases are also subject to annual escalators and also require us to pay substantially all costs associated with the lease, including real estate taxes, ground lease payments, insurance, utilities and routine maintenance, in addition to the annual cash rent. see note 11 for discussion of our leases and lease obligations.
we have planned capital expenditures in 2024 of approximately $830 million to $860 million domestically, which is inclusive of the capital expenditures required under the triple-net lease agreements, each of which requires us to spend a specified percentage of net revenues at the respective domestic properties, and an estimate of approximately $200 million to $250 million at mgm china, which is inclusive of the estimated amount of the gaming concession investment for 2024 that relates to capital projects. refer to note 12 for discussion of mgm grand paradise's commitment to investment in gaming and non-gaming projects and the development of international tourist markets as well as other contractual obligations pursuant to its gaming concession.
we continue to explore potential development or investment opportunities, such as expanding our global online gaming presence and pursuing a commercial gaming facility in new york, which may require cash commitments in the future. if our pursuit of a commercial gaming facility in new york is successful, we expect the project cost to be approximately $2 billion, reflecting an estimated $1.5 billion of improvements and a $500 million license fee, with the timing of costs dependent upon progress of the project and selection process. additionally, we have cash commitments to fund osaka ir kk relating to the development of an integrated resort in osaka, japan for our proportionate share of the unfinanced portion of osaka ir kk's development project. we currently expect our share to be 306 billion yen (approximately $2.2 billion as of december 31, 2023), which we anticipate funding over the next five years, subject to changes in the progress and scope of the development, the availability and amount of financing to be obtained by osaka ir kk, and the timing and amount of noncontrolling interest participation. refer to note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our commitments and guarantees.
we also expect to continue to repurchase shares pursuant to our share repurchase plans. subsequent to december 31, 2023, we repurchased approximately 7 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate amount of $320 million, excluding excise tax. repurchased shares were retired. in connection with those repurchases, the company completed its february 2023 $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan.
for additional information related to our long-term obligations, refer to the maturities of long-term debt table in note 9 and the lease liability maturity table in note 11.
principal debt arrangements see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding our debt agreements as of december 31, 2023.
critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions, particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates, where the estimates and assumptions involve both a significant level of estimation uncertainty due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for the matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change is high and also have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. however, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual results can differ from our estimates.
loss reserve for casino receivables marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our las vegas resorts. our other casinos do not emphasize marker play to the same extent, although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well. mgm china extends credit to certain in-house vip gaming customers. we maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers by assessing patrons' credit worthiness prior to issuing credit and we aggressively pursue collection from our customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely. these collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts, including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation. markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states and macau. markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the united states assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the united states. we consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when we issue credit to customers at our domestic properties who are not residents of the united states.
we maintain a loss reserve for casino accounts at all of our operating casino properties. expected credit losses, an operating expense, increases the loss reserve. we regularly evaluate the loss reserve for casino accounts, which involves judgments and assumptions about realizability, current and expected future economic conditions in various geographies, and business conditions. at domestic properties where marker play is not significant, the loss reserve is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances, which is supported by ongoing evaluation of relevant historical analysis and any other known information such as the current economic conditions that could drive losses. at domestic properties where marker play is significant, we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount, based on the age of the account, the customer's current and expected future financial condition, collection history, and current and expected future economic conditions. mgm china specifically analyzes the collectability of casino receivables on an individual basis taking into account the age of the account, the financial condition and the collection history of the customer. approximately $99 million and $54 million of casino receivables and $29 million and $25 million of the loss reserve for casino receivables relate to mgm china at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
the following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables:

casino receivables                                                             $567,766                   $500,986
loss reserve for casino accounts receivable                                     112,905                     97,929
loss reserve as a percentage of casino accounts receivable                      20    %                    20    %
the loss reserve as a percentage of casino accounts receivable in the current year is consistent with prior year. because individual customer account balances can be significant, the loss reserve and credit losses can change significantly between periods, as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in economic conditions occur. at december 31, 2023, a 100 basis-point change in the loss reserve as a percentage of casino receivables would change income before income taxes by $6 million.
fixed asset capitalization property and equipment are stated at cost. a significant amount of our property and equipment was acquired through business combinations and was therefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred. when we construct assets, we capitalize direct costs of the project, including fees paid to architects and contractors, property taxes, and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries.
we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures. whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense, or a capital asset is a matter of judgment. when constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired, which also may be a matter of judgment. in addition, our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets' estimated useful lives. we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets, engineering studies, and our estimate of the usage of the asset. whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively.
impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets we evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on our classification as held for sale or to be held and used. several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. for assets classified as held for sale, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. for assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset. for operating assets, fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital, developed using a standard capital asset pricing model, based on guideline companies in our industry. if an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. all recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.
there are several estimates, assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of long-lived assets. first, management must determine the usage of the asset. to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold, it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized. assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist. this means that some assets must be grouped, and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets. future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates.
on a quarterly basis, we review our major long-lived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment. potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results, negative industry or economic factors, significant changes to our operating environment, or changes in intended use of the asset group. we estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets and probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group, including potential sale. historically, undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin.
we review indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. we perform our annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights and trademarks. for our 2023 annual impairment tests, we either utilized the option to perform a qualitative ("step zero") analysis for certain of our indefinite-lived intangibles and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such intangibles exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin or we elected to perform a quantitative analysis and the fair value of such intangibles exceeded their carrying value by a substantial margin. as discussed below, management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses. if certain future operating results do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of the intangibles to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in an impairment charge.
we review goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. none of our reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2023. for our 2023 annual impairment tests, we either utilized the option to perform a step zero analysis for certain of our reporting units and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such reporting units exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin or we elected to perform a quantitative analysis and the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying value by a substantial margin. there are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment. in particular, future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. if future operating results of our reporting units do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. in addition, the determination of multiples, capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions or events outside of our control. the value of our empire city reporting unit is dependent upon us obtaining a commercial gaming license and the timing thereof, as well as other assumptions that may change throughout the bidding process as additional information becomes known, which includes the size, scope, and timing of constructing an expanded commercial gaming facility, the potential for and timing of a transaction for the monetization of the improvements and the proceeds and any rent associated with such transaction, and the incremental cash flows generated by the expanded facility, such as license payments and other payments to government entities, gaming tax rates, and forecasted revenue and expenses from operations. while the quantitative impairment analysis performed in 2023 resulted in the fair value of empire city exceeding its carrying value by a substantial margin based upon the assumptions as of the date of the analysis, any of these assumptions could change materially as a result of new or additional information and, if they do, could result in an impairment of up to the full amount of the reporting unit's goodwill of $256 million.
see note 2 and note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the income taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material.
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities related to net operating losses, tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences with future tax consequences. we reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized. accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed at each reporting period based on such "more-likely-than-not" realization threshold. this assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and tax planning strategies.
we recorded a valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of our domestic jurisdictions of $1.6 billion and $2.6 billion as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets of foreign jurisdictions of $180 million and $245 million as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. we reassess the realization of deferred tax assets each reporting period. in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination. likewise, if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance. in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located.
furthermore, we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. we believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported, but tax authorities may challenge these positions, which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities. accordingly, our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges. determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates. the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our income tax provision, net income and cash flows.

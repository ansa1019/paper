risks related to the operation of our business macroeconomic conditions and global events have impacted and will continue to impact our business and cost structure in a variety of ways, and these and other uncontrollable events may in the future impact the rate of growth of our patient population and our ability to grow the business. there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute cost savings or other initiatives in a manner that will offset the impact of these conditions, which could result in a material adverse impact on us.
we continue to be impacted by general conditions in the global economy and marketplace, many of which may be interrelated. these conditions relate to, among other things, inflation, interest rates, challenging labor market conditions, supply chain challenges, continuing effects of covid-19 and other factors that may impact our long term rate of growth of our patient population. certain of these impacts could be further intensified by concurrent global events such as the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine and in israel, gaza and the surrounding areas, which have continued to drive sociopolitical and economic uncertainty and volatility across the globe. the ultimate impact of these and other conditions on our business over time depends on future developments that are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.
we also have risk associated with covid-19. we have experienced and expect to continue to experience a negative impact on revenue and non-acquired growth from covid-19 due to lower treatment volumes, including from the negative impact of covid-19 on the mortality rates of our patients, which has in turn impacted our patient census, as well as the direct and indirect impact of covid-19 on our missed treatment rate and new admissions. we expect that the impact of covid-19 is likely to continue to negatively impact our revenue and non-acquired growth for a period of time due to the ongoing impact of the virus on eskd and ckd patient mortality rates, among other things. new admission rates, future revenues and non-acquired growth could also continue to be negatively impacted over time to the extent that the ckd population experiences elevated mortality levels due to covid-19. as further described below in the risk factor under the heading, "if we are unable to compete successfully...", certain other events beyond our control could also impact the rate of growth of our eskd patient population. any decrease in growth rates for the eskd or ckd patient population, higher mortality rates for dialysis patients or other reductions in demand for dialysis treatments, if sustained or significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. any such impact would be magnified to the extent it also resulted in a lower number of patients with commercial insurance or a lower percentage of patients under commercial insurance relative to government-based programs.
ongoing global economic conditions and political and regulatory developments, such as general labor, supply chain and inflationary pressures have also increased, and will continue to increase, our expenses, including among other things, staffing and labor costs. our business is labor intensive and our financial and operating results have been and continue to be sensitive to variations in labor-related costs and productivity. we have historically faced and expect to continue to face difficulties in hiring and retaining caregivers due in part to a nationwide shortage of clinical personnel. we expect certain of these increased staffing and labor costs to continue, due to, among other factors, recent legislative changes, such as senate bill 525 in california, and increased training costs. the cumulative impact of these increased costs could be material. in addition, our industry has experienced increased union organizing activities, including the filing of petitions by unions at certain of our competitors' clinics with a number of those clinics voting to unionize. potential staffing shortages or other potential developments or disruptions related to our teammates, if material, could ultimately lead to the unplanned closures of certain centers or adversely impact clinical operations, or may otherwise have a material adverse impact on our ability to provide dialysis services or the cost of providing those services, among other things.
the staffing and labor cost inflation described above, in addition to higher equipment and clinical supply costs, among other things, have put pressure on our existing cost structure, and we expect that some of these increased costs will continue as labor market conditions remain challenging, global supply chains continue to experience volatility and disruptions and as inflationary pressures continue. prolonged volatility, uncertainty, labor supply shortages and other challenging labor market conditions could have an adverse impact on our growth and ability to execute on our other strategic initiatives and a material adverse impact on our labor costs, among other things. prolonged strain on global supply chains may result in equipment and clinical supply shortages, disruptions, delays or associated price increases that could impact our ability to provide dialysis services or the cost of providing those services, among other things. moreover, to the extent that monetary policies or other factors impacting structural costs over the long term have contributed to or may in the future contribute to inflationary pressures, this may in turn continue to increase our labor and supply costs at a rate that outpaces the medicare or any other rate increases we may receive. in our value-based care and other programs where we assume financial accountability for total patient cost, an increase in our underlying staffing and labor expenses could have an impact on total cost of care. this increase may in turn impact the profitability of those programs relative to their respective funding.
we continue to invest in and implement cost savings initiatives designed to help mitigate these cost and volume pressures. these include, among other things, anticipated cost savings related to general and administrative cost efficiencies, such as ongoing initiatives that increase our use of third party service providers to perform certain activities, including financial reporting and information technology functions, initiatives relating to clinic optimization, initiatives for capacity utilization improvement, and procurement opportunities. we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur charges in connection with the continued implementation of these initiatives, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute these initiatives or that they will achieve expectations or succeed in helping offset the impact of these challenging conditions. any failure on our part to adjust our business and operations in this manner, to adjust to other marketplace developments or dynamics or to appropriately implement these initiatives in accordance with applicable legal, regulatory or compliance requirements could adversely impact our ability to provide dialysis services or the cost of providing those services, among other things, and ultimately could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
deterioration in economic conditions, whether driven by macroeconomic conditions, global events, domestic political or governmental volatility or other events beyond our control, including the aforementioned inflationary and labor market pressures, volatility and uncertainty, as well as potential volatility in interest rates, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. among other things, the potential decline in federal and state tax revenues that may result from a deterioration in economic conditions may create additional pressures to government sponsored programs. any potential period of extended or increased job losses in the u.s. as a result of adverse economic conditions, including economic deterioration, could ultimately result in a smaller percentage of our patients being covered by an employer group health plan and a larger percentage being covered by lower-paying government insurance programs or being uninsured. in the event a material reduction occurs in the share of our patients covered by commercial insurance plans, it would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the extent of these effects will depend upon, among other things, the extent and duration of any increased unemployment levels for our patient population, any economic deterioration or potential recession; and patients' ability to retain existing insurance and their individual choices with respect to their coverage, all of which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. declining economic conditions or other pressures that drive increased focus on healthcare costs may lead, employers to select more restrictive commercial plans with lower reimbursement rates. to the extent that payors are negatively impacted by a decline in the economy, we may experience further pressure on commercial rates, a slowdown in collections and a reduction in the amounts we expect to collect. for additional information on risks regarding the potential impact of decreases to the percentage or number of our patients with commercial insurance, see the risk factor under the heading "if the number or percentage of patients with higher-paying commercial insurance declines..."
if general economic conditions or labor market conditions deteriorate or remain uncertain for an extended period of time, we may experience negative impacts on reimbursement rates or the availability of insurance coverage for our patients, which may in turn materially and unfavorably impact our revenues and financial results. these impacts could lead us to incur future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying amount of our goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. as of december 31, 2023, we had approximately $7 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. we account for impairments of goodwill in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance, and record impairment charges when and to the extent a reporting unit's carrying amount is determined to exceed its estimated fair value. we use a variety of factors to assess changes in the financial condition, future prospects and other circumstances concerning our businesses and to estimate their fair value when applicable. these assessments and the related valuations can involve significant uncertainties and require significant judgment on various matters.
the aforementioned impacts may also drive an increased need for additional liquidity funded by accessing existing credit facilities, raising new debt in the capital markets, or other sources, and we may seek to refinance existing debt, which may be more difficult or costly in an uncertain or declining economic environment. for additional information regarding the risks related to our indebtedness, see the discussion in the risk factor under the heading "the level of our current and future debt..." furthermore, any extended billing or collection cycles, or deterioration in collectability of accounts receivable, will adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.
any or all of these economic conditions or developments, as well as other consequences of these conditions or developments, some of which are beyond our control and none of which we can reasonably predict, could have a material adverse effect on our patients, teammates, physician partners, suppliers, business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows or materially harm our reputation. in addition, these conditions or developments each may heighten many of the other risks and uncertainties discussed herein.
our business is subject to a complex set of governmental laws, regulations and other requirements and any failure to adhere to those requirements, or any changes in those requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, could materially harm our stock price, and in some circumstances, could materially harm our reputation.
we operate in a complex regulatory environment with an extensive and evolving set of federal, state and local governmental laws, regulations and other requirements that apply to us. these laws, regulations and other requirements are promulgated and overseen by a number of different legislative, regulatory, administrative, and quasi-regulatory bodies, each of which may have varying interpretations, judgments or related guidance. as such, we utilize considerable resources on an ongoing basis to monitor, assess and respond to applicable legislative, regulatory and administrative requirements, but there is no guarantee that we will be successful in our efforts to adhere to all of these requirements. laws, regulations and other requirements that apply to or impact our business include, but are not limited to:
•medicare and medicaid coverage and reimbursement statutes, and other federal coverage and reimbursement statutes, rules and regulations (including, but not limited to, manual provisions, local coverage determinations, national coverage determinations, payment schedules and agency guidance);
•medicare and medicaid provider requirements, including, but not limited to, requirements associated with providing and updating certain information about the medicare or medicaid entity, as applicable, and its direct and indirect affiliates;

•the other risk factors, trends and uncertainties set forth in part i item 1a. of this annual report on form 10-k, and the other risks and uncertainties discussed in any subsequent reports that we file or furnish with the sec from time to time.
the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements.
company overview our principal business is to provide dialysis and related lab services to patients in the united states, which we refer to as our u.s. dialysis business. we also operate our u.s. integrated kidney care (ikc) business, our u.s. other ancillary services, and our international operations, which we collectively refer to as our ancillary services, as well as our corporate administrative support. our u.s. dialysis business is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services in the u.s. for patients suffering from chronic kidney failure, also known as end stage renal disease (esrd) or end stage kidney disease (eskd).
our year-over-year overall financial performance in 2023 benefited from increased revenues in our u.s. dialysis, international and ikc businesses, as well as decreases in pharmaceutical costs, contract wage expense and advocacy spend. these positive trends were partially offset by continued increases in compensation expense, severance costs and center closure costs as we continued to focus on cost savings initiatives. in addition, 2023 was negatively impacted by increased legal costs and our continued investment in our integrated care support functions needed to support patient growth in our ikc business.
operational and financial highlights for 2023 include, among other things:
•u.s. dialysis revenue growth of 3.2% from an increase in average patient services revenue per treatment of $12.20;
•revenue growth of 35.2% in our ikc business which included the recognition of an incremental $55 million in shared savings revenue from the ikc adjustment described below, and 9.0% in our international operations;
•operating income of $1,603 million and adjusted operating income of $1,734 million;
•operating cash flows of $2,059 million and free cash flows of $1,236 million;
•repurchase of 2,903,832 shares of our common stock for aggregate consideration of $286 million, and a 1.8% reduction in our share count year-over-year;
•entry into a new term loan a-1 facility in the aggregate principal amount of $1,250 million and a revolving line of credit in an aggregate principal amount up to $1,500 million and purchase of $4,500 million notional amount of forward caps to shield our exposure to significant interest rate increases through 2026; and
•leverage ratio, as a multiple of consolidated ebitda, each as defined by our credit agreement, is back within our target range of 3.0x to 3.5x.
additional highlights include:
•a net decrease of 49 u.s. dialysis centers to improve center capacity utilization, as well as a net increase of 17 international dialysis centers from acquisitions and developments;
•a net increase in u.s. dialysis patients of 0.7% and international patients of 8.4% as of december 31, 2023;
•continued patient growth in ikc to 58,000 patients in risk-based integrated care arrangements and an additional 17,000 patients in other integrated care arrangements; and
•invested in mozarc medical holding llc (mozarc), an independent new company committed to reshaping kidney health and driving patient-centered technology solutions.
in 2024, we expect that treatment volumes will return to positive growth as the compounding impact of covid-19 on historical mortality rates of dialysis patients and our patient census subsides. we expect improving adjusted operating income due to the combination of the net impact of our continued improvements in our billing cycle process and ongoing cost savings initiatives. we continue to expect pressure on wage rates and other costs due to the challenging labor market and other inflationary conditions. we also expect to see continued investment and operating improvement in our integrated kidney care and value-based care initiatives during 2024. finally, considerable uncertainty exists surrounding the continued development of the various governmental laws, regulations and other requirements that may impact our business, including to the extent such developments impact the behavior of other health care market participants such as payors, employers, charitable organizations and government agencies.
the discussion below includes analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2023 compared to december 31, 2022. our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2021, in its part ii item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations".
references to the "notes" in the discussion below refer to the notes to the company's consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k at part iv item 15, "exhibits, financial statement schedules" as referred from part ii item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
general economic and marketplace conditions; legal and regulatory developments as noted above and described in further detail below, developments in general economic and market conditions have directly and indirectly impacted the company and in the future could have a material adverse impact on our patients, teammates, physician partners, suppliers, business, operations, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, share price, cash flows and/or liquidity. many of these external factors and conditions are interrelated, including, among other things, inflation, potential interest rate volatility, labor market conditions, wage pressure, the impact of covid-19 on the mortality rates of our patients and other eskd or ckd patients, supply chain challenges and the potential impact and application of innovative technologies, drugs or other treatments. certain of these impacts could be further intensified by concurrent global events such as the ongoing conflicts between russia and ukraine and in israel, gaza and the surrounding areas, which have continued to drive sociopolitical and economic uncertainty across the globe.
operational and financial impacts in the fourth quarter of 2023, treatment per day volumes were relatively flat compared to the third quarter. on a full year basis, we continue to experience a negative impact on revenue and treatment volume due to the cumulative and compounding negative impact of covid-19 on the mortality rates of our patients and the associated adverse impact on our patient census. however, we have continued to experience improvements with respect to these negative impacts with treatment volumes remaining relatively flat year over year and looking at the full year, we have seen an increase in patient census compared for the first time since 2019. despite these improvements, new admission rates, treatment volumes, future revenues and non-acquired growth, among other things, could continue to be negatively impacted over time to the extent that the eskd and ckd populations experience sustained elevated mortality levels. the magnitude of these cumulative impacts could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
ongoing global economic conditions and political and regulatory developments, such as general labor, supply chain and inflationary pressures have also increased, and will continue to increase, our expenses, including, among others, staffing and labor costs. we continue to experience increased levels of compensation compared to the prior year with contract labor improvements offset by investments in our teammate compensation. we expect certain of these increased staffing and labor costs to continue, due to, among other factors, the continuation of a challenging healthcare labor market. the cumulative impact of these increased costs could be material. in addition, our industry has experienced increased union organizing activities, including the filing of petitions by unions at certain of our competitors' clinics with a number of those clinics voting to unionize. potential staffing shortages or other potential developments or disruptions related to our teammates, if material, could ultimately lead to the unplanned closures of certain centers or adversely impact clinical operations, or may otherwise have a material adverse impact on our ability to provide dialysis services or the cost of providing those services, among other things.
the cost inflation trends described above have put pressure on our existing cost structure, and as noted above, we expect that certain of those increased costs will persist as inflationary and supply chain pressures and challenging labor market conditions continue. during the fourth quarter of 2023, we continued to invest in and implement cost savings initiatives designed to help mitigate these cost and volume pressures. these include identified cost savings related to the achievement of general and administrative cost efficiencies through ongoing initiatives that increase our use of third party service providers to perform certain activities. these opportunities and investments also include, among others, initiatives relating to clinic optimization, capacity utilization improvement and procurement opportunities, as well as investments in revenue cycle management. we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, charges in connection with the continued implementation of certain of these initiatives. there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute these initiatives or that they will achieve expectations or succeed in helping offset the impact of these challenging conditions.
legal and regulatory developments on october 13, 2019, california assembly bill 290 (ab 290) was signed into law. as drafted, ab 290 would, among other things, limit the amount of reimbursement paid to certain providers for services provided to patients with commercial insurance who receive charitable premium assistance (reimbursement cap). the implementation of ab 290 has been stayed pending resolution of legal challenges. the trial court recently issued a decision relating to these challenges to ab 290 that may result in the stay being lifted and at least some provisions of the law being implemented in the near future, although any appeal of the decision may result in the stay being continued. while it is currently unclear when and how those provisions may be implemented, in the event certain provisions of ab 290 are implemented in their proposed form, including the reimbursement cap, it may have negative consequences for our business. depending on what provisions are implemented, organizations that provide charitable premium assistance may choose to withdraw from california, which would have an adverse impact on the ability of patients to afford medicare premiums and medicare supplemental and commercial coverage. we expect that such an adverse impact will in turn adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in the past, bills similar to ab 290 have been introduced in other states, but none has become law. if these or similar bills are introduced and implemented in other jurisdictions, and organizations that provide charitable premium assistance in those jurisdictions are similarly impacted, it could in the aggregate have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. for additional information on risks associated with charitable premium assistance for esrd patients and the potential impact of decreases to the percentage or number of our patients with commercial insurance, see the risk factors under the heading "changes in federal and state healthcare legislation or regulations..." and "if the number or percentage of patients with higher-paying commercial insurance declines..."

u.s. dialysis business as of december 31, 2023, our u.s. dialysis business is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services, operating 2,675 outpatient dialysis centers serving a total of approximately 200,800 patients, and contracted to provide hospital inpatient dialysis services in approximately 790 hospitals. we estimate that we have approximately a 36% share of the u.s. dialysis market based upon the number of patients we serve.
approximately 89% of our 2023 consolidated revenues were derived directly from our u.s. dialysis business. the principal drivers of our u.s. dialysis revenues include    :
•our number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring approximately three in-center treatments per week as well as, to a lesser extent, the number of treatments for home-based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis; and
•our average dialysis patient service revenue per treatment, including the mix of patients with commercial plans and government programs as primary payor.
within our u.s. dialysis business, our home-based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis services are operationally integrated with our outpatient dialysis centers and related laboratory services. our outpatient, home-based and hospital inpatient dialysis services comprise approximately 76%, 18% and 6% of our u.s. dialysis revenues, respectively.
in the u.s., government dialysis-related payment rates are principally determined by federal medicare and state medicaid policy. for 2023, approximately 67% of our total u.s. dialysis patient service revenues were generated from government-based programs for services to approximately 89% of our total u.s. patients. these government-based programs are principally medicare and ma, medicaid and managed medicaid plans, and other government plans, representing approximately 56%, 8% and 3% of our u.s. dialysis patient service revenues, respectively.
on october 27, 2023, the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) issued a final rule to update the medicare esrd prospective payment system payment rate and policies for calendar year 2024. cms estimates the final rule will affect esrd facilities' average reimbursement by a productivity-adjusted market basket increase of 2.1% in 2024.
dialysis payment rates from commercial payors vary and a major portion of our commercial rates are set at contracted amounts with payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. on average, dialysis-related payment rates from contracted commercial payors are significantly higher than medicare, medicaid and other government program payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients in relation to total patients represents a significant driver of our total average dialysis patient service revenue per treatment. commercial payors (including hospital dialysis services) represent approximately 33% of u.s. dialysis patient service revenues.
for a discussion of government reimbursement, the medicare esrd bundled payment system, ma and commercial reimbursement, see part i item 1. business under the heading "u.s. dialysis business - sources of revenue-concentrations and risks." for a discussion of operational, clinical and financial risks and uncertainties that we face in connection with the medicare esrd bundled payment system, see the risk factor in part i item 1a. risk factors under the heading "our business is subject to a complex set of governmental laws, regulations and other requirements and any failure to adhere to those requirements, or any changes in those requirements..." for a discussion of operational, clinical and financial risks and uncertainties that we face in connection with commercial payors, see the risk factor in item 1a. risk factors under the heading "if the number or percentage of patients with higher-paying commercial insurance declines, if the average rates that commercial payors pay us declines..."
we anticipate that we will continue to experience increases in our operating costs in 2024 that may outpace any net medicare, commercial or other rate increases that we may receive, which could significantly impact our operating results. in particular, we expect to continue experiencing increases in operating costs that are subject to inflation, such as labor and supply costs, including increases in maintenance costs, regardless of whether there is a compensating inflation-based increase in medicare, commercial or other payor payment rates. in addition, we expect to continue to incur capital expenditures and associated depreciation and amortization costs to improve, renovate and maintain our facilities, equipment and information technology to meet evolving regulatory requirements and otherwise.
u.s. dialysis patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers, home-based dialysis programs and hospital inpatient dialysis programs, and consist principally of labor, benefits, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and other operating costs of the dialysis centers.
the principal drivers of our u.s. dialysis patient care costs include:
•clinical hours per treatment, labor rates and benefit costs;
•vendor pricing and utilization levels of pharmaceuticals;
•business infrastructure costs, which include the operating costs of our dialysis centers; and
•medical supply costs.
other cost categories that can present significant variability include insurance costs and professional fees. in addition, proposed ballot initiatives or referendums, legislation, regulations or policy changes could cause us to incur substantial costs to prepare for, or implement changes required. any such changes could result in, among other things, increases in our labor costs or limitations on the amount of revenue that we can retain. for additional information on risks associated with potential and proposed ballot initiatives, referendums, legislation, regulations or policy changes, see the risk factor in item 1a. risk factors under the heading, "changes in federal and state healthcare legislation or regulations..."
our average clinical hours per treatment was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. we are always striving for improved productivity levels, however, changes in factors such as federal and state policies or regulatory billing requirements can lead to increased labor costs as can increases in turnover. in 2023, the demand for skilled clinical personnel continued, exacerbated by the nationwide shortage of these resources. in 2023 and 2022, we experienced increases in our clinical labor wage rates, which includes contract labor, of approximately 1.3% and 7.4%, respectively. we expect to continue to see higher clinical labor rates in 2024 due to labor market conditions, including changes in local minimum wage laws, and the continued competition for skilled clinical personnel. in 2023, our overall clinical teammate turnover was relatively flat from 2022, but remains elevated from historical levels. we also continue to experience increases in the infrastructure and operating costs of our dialysis centers and general increases in rent and repairs and maintenance. in 2023, we continued to implement certain cost control initiatives to help manage our overall operating costs, including labor productivity, and we expect to continue these initiatives in 2024.
our u.s. dialysis general and administrative expenses represented 10.1% and 9.8% of our u.s. dialysis revenues in 2023 and 2022, respectively. increases in general and administrative expenses over the last several years were primarily related to strengthening our dialysis business and related compliance and operational processes, responding to certain legal and compliance matters, professional fees associated with enhancing our information technology (it) systems, such as our new clinical system, and more recently severance costs related to planned administrative efficiencies and advocacy costs in 2022 related to countering union policy efforts. we expect that these levels of general and administrative expenses will be impacted by continued investment in developing our capabilities and executing on our strategic priorities, among other things.

(1)normalized non-acquired treatment growth reflects year over year growth in treatment volume, adjusted to exclude acquisitions and other similar transactions, and further adjusted to normalize for the number and mix of treatment days in a given period versus the prior period.
our u.s. dialysis treatment volume is directly correlated with our operating revenues and expenses. the decrease in our u.s. dialysis treatments in 2023 was primarily driven by fewer treatment days.

(1)general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2022 included advocacy costs of approximately $51 million incurred to counter union policy efforts, including a california statewide ballot initiative (ca proposition 29).
charges impacting operating income closure costs. during the year ended december 31, 2023, we continued the strategic review of our outpatient clinic capacity requirements and utilization, which have been impacted both by declines in our patient census in some markets due to the covid-19 pandemic as well as by our initiatives toward, and advances in, increasing the proportion of our home dialysis patients. this continuing review, begun in the third quarter of 2022, has resulted in higher than normal charges for center capacity closures since its initiation. these capacity closure costs include net losses on assets retired, lease costs, asset impairments and accelerated depreciation and amortization.
during the year ended december 31, 2023, u.s. dialysis center closure costs were approximately $99.1 million, which increased our patient care costs by $28.0 million, our general and administrative expenses by $20.6 million and our depreciation and amortization expense by $50.5 million. by comparison, during the year ended december 31, 2022, u.s. dialysis center closures were approximately $85.7 million, which increased our patient care costs by $20.7 million, our general and administrative expenses by $19.2 million and our depreciation and amortization expense by $45.8 million.
in the upcoming fiscal year, we will continue to optimize our u.s. dialysis center footprint through center mergers and/or closures and expect our center closure levels to mirror the current year's elevated closure levels.
severance costs. during the fourth quarter of 2022, we committed to a plan to increase efficiencies and cost savings in certain general and administrative support functions. as a result of this plan, we recognized expenses related to termination and other benefit commitments in our u.s. dialysis business of $26.7 million and $17.0 million during the twelve months ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
patient care costs. u.s. dialysis patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and consist principally of compensation expenses including labor and benefits, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and other operating costs of the dialysis centers.
u.s. dialysis patient care costs per treatment increased primarily due to increased compensation expenses including increased wage rates and headcount, as well as increases in medical supply costs, routine repairs and maintenance, health benefit expenses, professional fees and utilities expense. other drivers of this change include increases in travel costs, other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers, office equipment expense, and center closure costs, as described above. these increases were partially offset by decreases in pharmaceutical unit costs and contract wages.
general and administrative expenses. u.s. dialysis general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increases in compensation expense including increased wage rates and severance costs, as described above. other drivers of this change include higher gains recognized on the sale of our self-developed properties in 2022 and increases in it-related costs, contributions to our charitable foundation, travel costs, long-term incentive compensation and marketing and advertising expenses. these increases were partially offset by decreases in advocacy costs and professional fees.
depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization expense is directly impacted by the number of our dialysis centers and the information technology that we develop and acquire as well as changes in useful lives of assets. u.s. dialysis depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2023 primarily due to accelerated depreciation for expected center closures, as described above.
equity investment income. u.s. dialysis equity investment income increased primarily due to increased profitability at certain nonconsolidated dialysis partnerships.

u.s. dialysis operating income was negatively impacted by center closure and severance costs, as described above. operating income and adjusted operating income increased compared to 2022 primarily due to an increase in our average patient service revenue per treatment, as described above, and decreases in pharmaceutical unit costs, contract wages and advocacy costs. these increases in operating income and adjusted operating income were partially offset by increases in compensation expenses and decreased gains on sale, each described above, as well as increased costs related to travel, contributions to our foundation, medical supply costs, routine repairs and maintenance, it-related costs, health benefit expenses and utilities expense. operating income and adjusted operating income were also impacted by decreased dialysis treatment volume, described above, and increases in other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers, long-term incentive compensation, marketing and advertising expense and office equipment expense.
other - ancillary services our other operations include ancillary services that are primarily aligned with our core business of providing dialysis services to our network of patients. as of december 31, 2023, these consisted primarily of our ikc business, certain u.s. other ancillary businesses (including our clinical research programs, transplant software business, and venture investment group), and our international operations.
these ancillary services, including our international operations, generated revenues of approximately $1.299 billion in 2023, representing approximately 11% of our consolidated revenues.
as of december 31, 2023, davita ikc provided integrated care and disease management services to approximately 58,000 patients in risk-based integrated care arrangements and to an additional 17,000 patients in other integrated care arrangements. we also expect to add additional service offerings to our business and pursue additional strategic initiatives in the future as circumstances warrant, which could include, among other things, healthcare services not related to kidney disease.
for a discussion of the risks related to ikc and our ancillary services, see the discussion in the risk factors in item 1a. risk factors under the headings, "the u.s. integrated kidney care, u.s. other ancillary services and international operations that we operate or invest in now or in the future..." and "if we are not able to successfully implement our strategy with respect to our integrated kidney care and value-based care initiatives..."
as of december 31, 2023, our international dialysis business owned or operated 367 outpatient dialysis centers located in 11 countries outside of the u.s. for 2023, total revenues generated from our international operations were approximately 6% of our consolidated revenues.

revenues:
our ikc revenues were impacted by an increase in shared savings from our vbc contracts and an increase in revenues from our special needs plans. our u.s. other ancillary services revenues were impacted by increased revenues in our clinical research programs. our international revenues increased due to acquisition-related growth as well as average reimbursement rate increases in certain countries.
items impacting operating income ikc adjustment. the increase in ikc revenues for 2023, as described above, was primarily due to the lifting of certain revenue recognition constraints for some of our value-based care contracts with health plans, allowing us to recognize approximately $55 million in incremental shared savings revenues.
severance and other costs. during the fourth quarter of 2022, similar to u.s. dialysis, we committed to a plan to increase efficiencies and cost savings in certain general and administrative support functions and other overhead costs. as a result of this plan, we recognized expenses related to termination and other benefit commitments in our ikc business of $0.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2023. by comparison, during the twelve months ended december 31, 2022, we recognized expenses related to termination and other benefit commitments in our ikc business, and similar expenses and other charges in our international operations, of $0.5 million and $7.5 million, respectively.
goodwill impairment charge and related items. during the fourth quarter of 2023, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $26.1 million in our transplant software business. we also recognized a gain of $7.7 million due to a reduction in the estimated value of earn-out obligations from our original acquisition of this business. this impairment charge and related gain resulted from a reduction in estimated fair value for the business driven primarily from the business not achieving its revenue targets, with reduced revenue expectations for future years, as well as an increase in the risk-free rate.
operating loss and adjusted operating loss:
our ikc operating loss was impacted by the ikc change in estimate, as described above. our ikc operating loss and adjusted operating loss decreased primarily due to increased revenues, as described above, partially offset by continued investments in our integrated care support functions. our u.s. other ancillary services operating loss was impacted by a goodwill impairment charge and related gain, as described above. our u.s. other ancillary services operating loss and adjusted operating loss was impacted by improved performance in our clinical research programs. our international operating income in 2022 was impacted by severance and other costs in one of our international businesses, as described above. international operating income and adjusted operating income were impacted by acquisition-related growth, partially offset by increases in equity losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency at our apac jv and other direct operating expenses associated with our international dialysis centers.
corporate administrative support corporate administrative support consists primarily of labor, benefits and long-term incentive compensation expense, as well as professional fees, for departments which provide support to more than one of our various operating lines of business. corporate administrative support expenses are included in general and administrative expenses on our consolidated income statement.
accruals for legal matters. during 2023, we recorded a charge of $40 million for a legal matter within corporate administrative support.
corporate support expenses increased $33 million primarily driven by accruals for legal matters, as described above, as well as increased compensation expenses, including long-term incentive compensation, partially offset by higher legal fees in 2022.

(1)for a reconciliation of our effective income tax rate from continuing operations attributable to davita inc., see the "reconciliations of non-gaap measures" section below.
debt expense debt expense increased primarily due to an increase in our overall weighted average effective interest rate, partially offset by a decrease in our weighted average credit facility balance outstanding. our overall weighted average effective interest rate on all debt, including the effect of interest rate caps and amortization of debt discount, was 4.52% in 2023 compared to 3.96% in 2022. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the components of our debt and changes in them since 2022.
debt extinguishment and modification costs debt extinguishment and modification charges were $8 million in 2023 related to the refinancing of our prior term loan a and prior revolving line of credit. these costs were composed partially of deferred financing costs written off for the portion of this debt considered extinguished and reborrowed and partially of fees incurred as part of this debt refinancing.
other (loss) income other (loss) income consists primarily of interest income on cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments, equity investment (loss) income on equity method investments other than dialysis partnerships, realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized on other investments, impairments on investments, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. other loss increased primarily due to equity investment losses on our new investment in mozarc which was net of the $15 million gain from the non-cash asset contributed at close. this was partially offset by decreased losses recognized on other investments and an increase in interest income.
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate and effective income tax rate from continuing operations attributable to davita inc. decreased in 2023 primarily due to decreases in nondeductible advocacy expenses and benefits realized from tax returns finalized during the year. these decreases were partially offset by nondeductible costs related to a legal matter and a reduction in benefits recognized for stock compensation in 2023.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests the increase in income attributable to noncontrolling interests was due to an increase in earnings at certain u.s. dialysis partnerships.
u.s. dialysis accounts receivable our u.s. dialysis accounts receivable balances at december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022 were $1.632 billion and $1.899 billion, respectively, representing approximately 54 days and 66 days of revenue (dso), respectively. the decrease in dso was primarily due to strong collections from non-medicare payors and medicare timing recoveries. our dso calculation is based on the most recent quarter's average revenues per day. there were no significant changes during 2023 from 2022 in the carrying amount of accounts receivable outstanding over one year old or in the amounts pending approval from third-party payors.
as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, our u.s. dialysis accounts receivable balances that are more than six months old represented approximately 19% of our u.s. dialysis accounts receivable balances outstanding. substantially all revenue realized for patient services is received from government and commercial payors, as discussed above. less than 1% of our revenues in both periods were classified as patient pay.
amounts pending approval from third-party payors associated with medicare bad debt claims as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, other than the standard monthly billing, were approximately $107 million and $111 million, respectively, and are classified within other receivables. a significant portion of our medicare bad debt claims are typically paid to us before the medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims but are subject to subsequent adjustment based upon the actual results of those audits. such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed.

consolidated cash flows consolidated cash flows from operating activities for 2023 and 2022 were $2,059 million and $1,565 million, respectively. the increase in cash flows from continuing operations was primarily driven by improvements in operating results and cash collections on accounts receivable as well as decreases in cash taxes paid partially offset by increases in interest payments on debt and other working capital items.
cash flows used for investing activities in 2023 increased $142 million compared to 2022 primarily due to a decrease in proceeds received on self-developed properties as well as increases in equity investments including the investment in mozarc. these increases were partially offset by decreases in acquisition expenditures combined with decreases in capital expenditures.
cash flows used in financing activities increased $49 million in 2023 compared to 2022. significant uses of cash during 2023 consisted of the pay-off of the remaining principal balance outstanding on our prior term loan a and prior revolving line of credit in the amount of $1,444 million and $150 million, respectively. other uses of cash included regularly scheduled and other principal payments under our senior secured credit facilities totaling approximately $54 million on our prior term loan a, $16 million on our new term loan a-1, described below, $57 million on term loan b-1, additional net repayments of $15 million on our revolving line of credit, as well as additional required payments under other debt arrangements. additionally, we recognized financing cash outflows of $30 million in deferred financing costs related to the amendments to the senior secured credit agreement and $40 million in cap premium fees for our 2023 forward interest cap agreements. significant sources of cash during the period included the refinancing of the term loan a and revolving line of credit with a secured term loan a-1 facility in the aggregate principal amount of $1,250 million. during the year ended december 31, 2023 we also used cash to repurchase 2,903,832 shares of our common stock.
by comparison, 2022 included a net draw of $165 million on our prior revolving line of credit, net debt payments which consisted of regularly scheduled mandatory principal payments under our senior secured credit facilities totaling approximately $98 million on our prior term loan a and $27 million on term loan b-1, as well as additional required payments under other debt arrangements. in addition, during the twelve months ended december 31, 2022 we used cash to repurchase 8,094,661 shares of our common stock.
dialysis center capacity and growth we are typically able to increase our capacity by extending hours at our existing dialysis centers, expanding our existing dialysis centers, relocating our dialysis centers, developing new dialysis centers and by acquiring dialysis centers. the development of a typical new outpatient dialysis center generally requires approximately $2 million for leasehold improvements and other capital expenditures. based on our experience, a new outpatient dialysis center typically opens within a year after the property lease is signed, normally achieves operating profitability in the second year after medicare certification, and normally reaches maturity within three to five years. acquiring an existing outpatient dialysis center requires a substantially greater initial investment, but profitability and cash flows are generally accelerated and more predictable. to a limited extent, we enter into agreements to provide management and administrative services to outpatient dialysis centers in which we own a noncontrolling interest or which are wholly-owned by third parties in return for management fees.

we retired all shares of common stock held in treasury effective december 31, 2023 and 2022. subsequent to december 31, 2023, we have repurchased 1,507,000 shares of or common stock for $164 million at an average price paid of $107.97 per share through february 12, 2024.
see further discussion of our share repurchase activity and authorizations in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.
available liquidity as of december 31, 2023, our cash balance was $380 million and we held approximately $12 million in short-term investments. at that time we also had undrawn capacity on the revolving line of credit under our senior credit facilities of $1.5 billion. credit available under this revolving line of credit is reduced by the amount of any letters of credit outstanding thereunder, of which there were none as of december 31, 2023. as of december 31, 2023 we separately had approximately $151 million in letters of credit outstanding under a separate bilateral secured letter of credit facility.
see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for components of our long-term debt and their interest rates.
we believe that our cash flows from operations and other sources of liquidity, including from amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities and our access to the capital markets, will be sufficient to fund our scheduled debt service under the terms of our debt agreements and other obligations for the foreseeable future, including the next 12 months. from time to time, depending on market conditions, our capital requirements and the availability of financing, among other things, we may seek to refinance our existing debt and may incur additional indebtedness. our primary recurrent sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings, which are subject to general, economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, as described in item 1a. risk factors under the heading "the level of our current and future debt..."
reconciliations of non-gaap measures the following tables provide reconciliations of adjusted operating income (loss) to operating income (loss) as presented on a u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) basis for our u.s. dialysis reportable segment as well as for our u.s. ikc business, our u.s. other ancillary services, our international business, and for our total ancillary services which combines them and is disclosed as our other segments category, in addition to our corporate administrative support. these non-gaap or "adjusted" measures are presented because management believes these measures are useful adjuncts to, but not alternatives for, our gaap results.
specifically, management uses adjusted operating income (loss) to compare and evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to establish operational budgets and forecasts and for incentive compensation purposes. we believe this non-gaap measure is also useful to investors and analysts in evaluating our performance over time and relative to competitors, as well as in analyzing the underlying trends in our business. we also believe this presentation enhances a user's understanding of our normal operating income by excluding certain items which we do not believe are indicative of our ordinary results of operations.
in addition, our effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations attributable to davita inc. excludes noncontrolling owners' income, which primarily relates to non-tax paying entities. we believe this adjusted effective income tax rate is useful to management, investors and analysts in evaluating our performance and establishing expectations for income taxes incurred on our ordinary results attributable to davita inc.
finally, our free cash flow from continuing operations represents net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less distributions to noncontrolling interests and all capital expenditures (including development capital expenditures, routine maintenance and information technology), plus contributions from noncontrolling interests and proceeds from the sale of self-developed properties. management uses this measure to assess our ability to fund acquisitions and meet our debt service obligations and we believe this measure is equally useful to investors and analysts as an adjunct to cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations and other measures under gaap.
it is important to bear in mind that these non-gaap "adjusted" measures are not measures of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered in isolation from, nor as substitutes for, their most comparable gaap measures.

off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations in addition to the debt obligations and operating lease liabilities reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with letters of credit as well as certain working capital funding obligations associated with our equity investments in nonconsolidated dialysis ventures that we manage and some we manage that are wholly-owned by third parties.
we also have potential obligations to purchase the noncontrolling interests held by third parties in many of our majority-owned dialysis partnerships and other nonconsolidated entities. these obligations are in the form of put provisions that are exercisable at the third-party owners' discretion within specified periods as outlined in each specific put provision. for additional information see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
the following is a summary of these cash contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31, 2023:

as of december 31, 2023 we had outstanding letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately $151 million under a separate bilateral secured letter of credit facility.
as of december 31, 2023 we have outstanding purchase agreements with various suppliers to purchase set amounts of dialysis equipment, parts, pharmaceuticals, and supplies. if we fail to meet the minimum purchase commitments under these contracts during any year, we are required to pay the difference to the supplier. for additional information see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
we also have certain potential commitments to provide working capital funding, if necessary, to certain nonconsolidated dialysis businesses that we manage and in which we own a noncontrolling equity interest or which are wholly-owned by third parties. for additional information see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
additionally, we expect our 2024 capital expenditures to be consistent with our 2023 capital expenditures.
in addition, we have approximately $45 million of existing long-term income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, which are excluded from the table above as reasonably reliable estimates of their timing cannot be made.
finally, on may 25, 2022, we entered into an agreement with medtronic, inc. and one of its subsidiaries (collectively, medtronic) to form a new, independent kidney care-focused medical device company (mozarc). the transaction closed on april 1, 2023. as a part of this transaction we agreed to pay medtronic additional consideration of up to $300 million if certain regulatory and commercial milestones are achieved between 2024 and 2028. as of december 31, 2023 we have contingent consideration of $86 million recorded for this obligation which represents its estimated fair value.

critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles. these accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, contingencies and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions (redeemable equity interests). all significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. actual results will generally differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material. changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on-going actual experience trends or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and accounts receivable, fair value estimates for goodwill and noncontrolling interests, accounting for income taxes, and loss contingencies are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates. for additional information, see part iv item 15, "exhibits, financial statement schedules" - note 1 - "organization and summary of significant accounting policies" as referred from part ii item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
revenue recognition and accounts receivable for our u.s. dialysis patient services. there are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of u.s. dialysis patient service revenue that we recognize in a given reporting period. payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments. in addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. the measurement and recognition of revenue requires the use of estimates of the amounts that will ultimately be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters.
revenues associated with medicare and medicaid programs are recognized based on (a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g., 80% for medicare patients) and (b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs providing secondary coverage (e.g., medicaid secondary coverage), the patient's commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. our dialysis-related reimbursements from medicare are subject to certain variations under medicare's single bundled payment rate system whereby our reimbursements can be adjusted for certain patient characteristics and other variable factors. our revenue recognition depends upon our ability to effectively capture, document and bill for medicare's base payment rate and these other factors. in addition, as a result of the potential range of variations that can occur in our dialysis-related reimbursements from medicare under the single bundled payment rate system, our revenue recognition is subject to a greater degree of estimating risk.
commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed-care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates; however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients covered under commercial healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non-contracted commercial healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience, historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments, the estimated timing of collections, changes in our expectations of the amounts that we expect to collect and regulatory compliance matters. determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our approximately 200,800 u.s. dialysis patients at any given point in time, together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month, requires complex, resource-intensive processes. collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years or longer after services are provided.
we generally expect the range of our u.s. dialysis revenue estimating risk to be within 1% of revenue, which can represent as much as approximately 6% of our u.s. dialysis business's adjusted operating income. changes in estimates are reflected in the then-current financial statements based on on-going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses, and have not been significant.
revenues for laboratory services, which are integrally related to our dialysis services, are recognized in the period services are provided at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received.
certain fair value estimates. fair value measurements and estimates affect, or potentially affect, a variety of elements in the company's financial statements. two of the elements most significantly impacted by fair value estimates are the company's goodwill impairment assessments and remeasurements of its noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions balance.
goodwill is not amortized, but is assessed for impairment at least annually, or when changes in circumstances warrant. an impairment charge is recorded when and to the extent a reporting unit's carrying amount is determined to exceed its estimated fair value. changes in circumstance that may trigger a goodwill impairment assessment for one of our business units can include, among others, changes in the legal environment, addressable market, business strategy, development or business plans, reimbursement structure or rates, operating performance, future prospects, relationships with partners, interest rates and/or market value indications for the subject business. we use a variety of factors to assess changes in the financial condition, future prospects and other circumstances for businesses subject to goodwill impairment assessment. however, these assessments and the related valuations can involve significant uncertainties and require significant judgment on various matters.
the company is also required to remeasure its noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions to estimated fair value each reporting period. these estimates also require substantive judgment on meaningful uncertainties concerning this significant balance. see notes 16 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the company's approach to these valuations, the variables and uncertainties involved, and the sensitivity of these valuations to changes in a primary aggregate valuation metric.
accounting for income taxes. our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous state and foreign jurisdictions, and changes in tax laws or regulations may be proposed or enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax liability. the actual impact of any such laws or regulations could be materially different from our current estimates.
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our consolidated income tax expense. deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdictions from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, results of recent operations, and assumptions about the amount of future federal, state, and foreign pre-tax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. the assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgments and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. the allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets.
loss contingencies. as discussed in notes 1 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, we operate in a highly regulated industry and are party to various lawsuits, claims, qui tam suits, governmental investigations and audits (including, without limitation, investigations or other actions resulting from our obligation to self-report suspected violations of law), contract disputes and other legal proceedings. assessments of such matters can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. we record accruals for loss contingencies on such matters to the extent that we determine an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion.
significant new accounting standards see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for information regarding certain recent financial accounting standards that have been issued by the financial accounting standards board (fasb).

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the market price of our common stock.
operational risks we may not be able to execute our business plan or growth strategy, including utility infrastructure investments.
operational, financial or regulatory conditions may result in our inability to execute our business plan or growth strategy, including investments related to natural gas pipeline modernization and our renewable energy projects, and the build-transfer execution goals within our business plan.
our enterprise-wide transformation roadmap initiatives are designed to identify long-term sustainable capability enhancements, cost optimization improvements, technology investments and work process optimization, has increased the volume and pace of change and may not be effective as it continues. our customer and regulatory initiatives may not achieve planned results. utility infrastructure investments may not materialize, may cease to be achievable or economically viable and may not be successfully completed. natural gas may cease to be viewed as an economically and environmentally attractive fuel. certain environmental activist groups, investors and governmental entities continue to oppose natural gas delivery and infrastructure investments because of perceived environmental impacts associated with the natural gas supply chain and end use. energy conservation, energy efficiency, distributed generation, energy storage, policies favoring electric heat over gas heat and other factors may reduce demand for natural gas and electricity. in addition, we consider acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses, jvs, and mergers from time to time as we execute on our business plan and growth strategy. any of these circumstances could adversely affect our business, results of operations and growth prospects. even if our business plan and/or growth strategy are executed, there is still risk of, among other things, human error in maintenance, installation or operations, shortages or delays in obtaining equipment, including as a result of transportation delays and availability, labor availability and performance below expected levels (in addition to the other risks discussed in this section). we are currently experiencing, and expect to continue to experience, supply chain challenges, including labor availability issues, impacting our ability to obtain materials for our gas and electric projects, as well as our ability to ensure timely completion.
our distribution, transmission and generation activities involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, including potential public safety risks.
our gas distribution and transmission, electric generation, transmission and distribution activities, involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, including, but not limited to, gas leaks and over-pressurization, downed power lines, stray electrical voltage, excavation or vehicular damage to our infrastructure, outages, environmental spills, mechanical problems and other incidents, which could cause substantial financial losses. these hazards and risks have resulted and may result in serious injury or loss of life to employees and/or the general public, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations, adverse regulatory rulings and reputational harm, which in turn could lead to substantial business and financial losses. the location of pipeline facilities, including regulator stations, liquefied natural gas and underground storage, or generation, transmission, substation and distribution facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from such incidents. hazardous incidents have subjected and may subject us to both civil and criminal litigation or administrative or other legal proceedings from time to time, which could result in substantial monetary judgments, fines, or penalties against us, be resolved on unfavorable terms, and require us to incur significant operational expenses. the occurrence of incidents has in certain instances adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect our reputation, cash flows, financial position and/or results of operations. we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses.
we currently conduct and may conduct in the future certain operations through a jv arrangement involving third- party investors that may result in operational impasses or litigation, including business delays as a result of such arrangements.
we have and may enter into jv arrangements involving third-party investors, including the nipsco minority interest transaction. as part of a jv arrangement, third-party investors may hold certain protective rights that may impact our ability to make certain decisions, restricting our operational and corporate flexibility. any such third-party investors may have interests and objectives which may differ from ours, we may be unable to cause these third parties to take action that we believe would be in the jv's best interest, and, accordingly, disputes may arise that may result in operational impasses or litigation, including business delays.
failure to adapt to advances in technology, including alternative energy sources, and changes in laws or regulations to support such advances in technology or alternative energy sources, and our ability to manage such related costs could make us less competitive.
item 1a. risk factors nisource inc.
a key element of our electric business model includes generating power at central station power plants to achieve economies of scale and produce power at a competitive cost. we continue to transition our generation portfolio in order to implement new and diverse technologies including renewable energy, distributed generation, energy storage, and energy efficiency designed to reduce regulated emissions. advances in technology and potential competition supported by changes in laws or regulations could reduce the cost of electric generation and provide retail alternatives causing power sales to decline and the value of our generating facilities to decline.
our natural gas business model depends on widespread utilization of natural gas for space heating as a core driver of revenues. alternative energy sources, new technologies or alternatives to natural gas space heating, including cold climate heat pumps and/or efficiency of other products, and potential competition supported by changes in laws or regulations could reduce demand and increase customer attrition, which could impact our ability to recover on our investments in our gas distribution assets.
our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and successfully adapt to technological changes, to offer services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards, including environmental impacts associated with our products and services, and to recover all, or a significant portion of, remaining investments in retired assets. a failure by us to effectively adapt to changes in technology, successfully implement such changes, and manage the related costs could harm the ability of our products and services to remain competitive in the marketplace and could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. furthermore, if these changes do not provide the anticipated benefits or meet customer demands, such failure could materially adversely affect our business model as well as impact results of operations and financial condition.
increased dependency on technology may hinder our business operations and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation if such technology fails.
we use a variety of technological tools and systems including both company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties. these tools and systems support critical functions including scheduling and dispatching of service technicians, automated meter reading systems, customer care and billing, operational plant logistics, management reporting and external financial reporting. the failure of these or other similarly important technologies, or our inability to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded, recovered (including timely recovered), or integrated into other technologies, could hinder our business operations and adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations. although the company has, when possible, developed alternative sources of technology and built redundancy into its computer networks and tools, there can be no assurance that these efforts would protect against all potential issues related to the loss of any such technologies.
aging infrastructure may lead to disruptions in operations and increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs.
we have risks associated with aging electric and gas infrastructure. these risks can be driven by threats such as, but not limited to, electrical faults, mechanical failure, internal corrosion, external corrosion, ground movement and stress corrosion and/or cracking. the age of these assets may result in a need for replacement, a higher level of maintenance costs or unscheduled outages, despite efforts by us to properly maintain or upgrade these assets through inspection, scheduled maintenance and capital investment. in addition, the nature of the information available on aging infrastructure assets, which in some cases is incomplete, may make the operation of the infrastructure, inspections, maintenance, upgrading and replacement of the assets particularly challenging. missing or incorrect infrastructure data may lead to (1) difficulty properly locating facilities, which can result in excavator damage and operational or emergency response issues, and (2) configuration and control risks associated with the modification of system operating pressures in connection with turning off or turning on service to customers, which can result in unintended outages or operating pressures. also, additional maintenance and inspections are required in some instances to improve infrastructure information and records and address emerging regulatory or risk management requirements, resulting in increased costs.
supply chain issues related to shortages of materials, labor and transportation logistics may lead to delays in the maintenance and replacement of aging or damaged infrastructure, which could increase the probability and/or impact of a public safety incident. we lack diversity in suppliers of some gas materials. while we have implemented contractual protections with suppliers and stockpile some materials in inventory for such supply risks, we may not be effective in ensuring that we can obtain adequate emergency supply on a timely basis in each state, that no compromises are being made on quality and that we have alternate suppliers available. the failure to operate our assets as desired could result in interruption of electric service, major component failure at generating facilities and electric substations, gas leaks and other incidents, and an inability to meet firm service and compliance obligations, which could adversely impact revenues, and could also result in increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs, which, if not fully recovered from customers, could negatively impact our financial results.
item 1a. risk factors nisource inc.
we may be unable to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or at all, and the insurance coverage we do obtain may not provide protection against all significant losses.
our ability to obtain insurance, as well as the cost and coverage of such insurance, is impacted by various events and developments affecting our industry and the financial condition and underwriting considerations of insurers. for example, some insurers have discontinued underwriting certain carbon-intensive energy-related businesses such as those in the coal industry or excluded coverage for specific perils such as wildfires or punitive damage risks. certain perils, such as cyber liability, are now being excluded from some master policies for property and casualty insurance, requiring, where we have the ability, procurement of additional policies to maintain consistent coverage at an additional cost. specific natural catastrophe events, such as hail and tornado, may not be covered with the same limits as other perils in certain property policies, as full coverage for these events is unavailable in the marketplace without costly specialty policies. insurance coverage may not continue to be available at limits, rates or terms acceptable to us. in addition, our insurance is not sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we are subject. certain types of damages, expenses or claimed costs, such as fines and penalties, have been and in the future may be excluded under the policies. in addition, insurers providing insurance to us may raise defenses to coverage under the terms and conditions of the respective insurance policies that could result in a denial of coverage or limit the amount of insurance proceeds available to us. any losses for which we are not fully insured or that are not covered by insurance at all could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
aspects of the implementation of our electric generation strategy, including the timing of the retirement of our coal generation units or the addition of new generation resources, may be delayed and may not achieve intended results.
we intend to retire the remaining two coal units at r.m. schahfer generating station by the end of 2025 and the remaining coal-fired generation by the end of 2028, to be replaced by lower-cost, reliable and cleaner options. our 2021 integrated resource plan ("2021 plan") validated the activities underway pursuant to our prior integrated resource plans and calls for the retirement of the michigan city generating station, replacement of existing vintage gas peaking facilities at the r.m. schahfer generating station and upgrades to the electric transmission system. macro supply chain issues and u.s. federal policy actions could create uncertainty around the availability of key input materials necessary to develop and place our renewable energy projects in service.
in the u.s., solar industry supply chain issues include the u.s. department of commerce regulations related to antidumping and countervailing duties circumvention, the uyghur forced labor protection act, section 201 tariffs and persistent general global supply chain and labor availability issues. the most prominent effect of these issues is the curtailment of imported solar panels and other key components required to complete utility scale solar projects in the u.s. any available solar panels may not meet the cost and efficiency standards of our currently approved projects and the incremental cost may not be recoverable through customer rates. as a result of the challenges in obtaining solar panels, many solar projects in the u.s. have been delayed or canceled. as we are in the midst of a transition to an electric generation portfolio with more renewable resources, including solar, our projects are vulnerable to the effects of these issues.
our expectation has been that renewable or alternative energy sources would be some of the primary ways in which we will meet our electric generation capacity and reliability obligations to the miso market and reliably serve our customers when we retire our coal generation capacity. the uncertainty surrounding the completion of generation resource projects could create significant risks for us to reliably meet our capacity and energy obligations to miso and to provide reliable and affordable energy to our customers. any additional delays to the completion dates of our planned and approved solar projects or other electric generation projects, including our proposed gas peaking facility could impact our capacity position and our ability to meet our resource adequacy obligations to miso. delays to the completion dates of our projects could also include delays in the financial return of certain investments and impact the overall timing of our electric generation transition.
our electric generation strategy may require additional investment to meet our miso obligations and may require significant future capital expenditures, operating costs and charges to earnings that may negatively impact our financial position, financial results and cash flows. an inability to secure and deliver on renewable projects has negatively impacted, and could in the future negatively impact, our generation transition timeline and could negatively impact our achievement of decarbonization goals and reputation.
our capital projects and programs subject us to construction and supply risks, and are subject to regulatory oversight, including requirements for permits, approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies.
item 1a. risk factors nisource inc.
our business requires substantial capital expenditures for investments in, among other things, capital improvements to our electric generating facilities, electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure, natural gas storage and other projects, including projects for environmental compliance. as we undertake these projects and programs, we may be unable to complete them on schedule or at the anticipated costs. additionally, we may construct or purchase some of these projects and programs to capture anticipated future growth, which may not materialize, and may cause the construction to occur over an extended period of time.
construction risks include, but are not limited to, changes in the availability or costs of materials, equipment, commodities or labor (including changes to tariffs on materials), delays caused by construction incidents or injuries, work stoppages, poor initial cost estimates, unforeseen engineering issues, and general contractors and subcontractors not performing as required under their contracts.
we are monitoring risks related to increasing delivery lead times for certain construction and other materials, increasing risk associated with the unavailability of materials due to global shortages in raw materials and issues with transportation logistics, and risk of decreased construction labor productivity in the event of disruptions in the availability of materials critical to our gas and electric operations. our efforts to enhance our resiliency to supply chain shortages may not be effective. we continue to see increasing prices associated with certain materials, equipment and products, which impacts our ability to complete major capital projects at the cost that was planned and approved. to the extent that delays occur, costs increase, costs become unrecoverable or recovery is delayed, or we otherwise become unable to effectively manage our affordability and complete our capital projects, our business operations, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition may be adversely affected. in addition, to the extent that delays occur on projects that target system integrity, the risk of an operational incident could increase.
our existing and planned capital projects require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from federal, state, and local governmental agencies, including obtaining necessary rights-of-way, easements and transmissions connections, as well as complying with various environmental statutes, rules and regulations, among other items. if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approvals or to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, we may not be able to construct or operate our facilities, we may be forced to incur additional costs or we may be unable to recover any or all amounts invested in a project. we also may not receive the anticipated increases in revenue and cash flows resulting from such projects and programs until after their completion.
a significant portion of the gas and electricity we sell is used by residential and commercial customers for heating and air conditioning. accordingly, fluctuations in weather, gas and electricity commodity costs, and economic conditions impact customer demand.
energy sales are sensitive to variations in weather. forecasts of energy sales are based on "normal" weather, which represents a long-term historical average. significant variations from normal weather resulting from climate change or other factors could have, and have had, a material impact on energy sales. additionally, residential usage, and to some degree commercial usage, is sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity, whereby usage declines with increased costs, thus affecting our financial results. commodity prices have been and may continue to be volatile as described in more detail in the below risk factor. rising gas costs could heighten regulator and stakeholder sensitivity relative to the impact of base rate increases on customer affordability. lastly, residential and commercial customers' usage is sensitive to economic conditions and factors such as recession, inflation, unemployment, consumption and consumer confidence. therefore, prevailing economic conditions affecting the demand of our customers may in turn affect our financial results.
fluctuations in the price of energy commodities or their related transportation costs, or an inability to obtain an adequate, reliable and cost- effective fuel supply may impact our ability to meet customer demand.
our current electric generating fleet has dependencies on coal and natural gas for fuel, and our gas distribution operations purchase and resell a portion of the natural gas we deliver to our customers. these energy commodities are subject to price fluctuations and fluctuations in associated transportation costs. we use physical hedging through the use of storage assets and use financial products in certain jurisdictions in order to offset fluctuations in commodity supply prices. we rely on regulatory recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order to fully recover the commodity costs incurred in selling energy to our customers. while we have historically been successful in the recovery of costs related to such commodity prices, there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered through rates in a timely manner.
in addition, we depend on electric transmission lines, natural gas pipelines, and other transportation and storage facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell to wholesale markets, supply natural gas to our gas storage and electric generation facilities, and provide retail energy services to our customers. if transportation is disrupted, if item 1a. risk factors nisource inc.
capacity is inadequate or if supply is interrupted due to issues at the wellhead, we may be unable to sell and deliver our gas and electric services to some or all of our customers. as a result, we may be required to procure additional or alternative electricity and/or natural gas supplies at then-current market rates, which, if recovery of related costs is disallowed, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.
failure to attract, retain or re-skill an appropriately qualified workforce, and maintain good labor relations, could adversely impact safety, service reliability, and customer satisfaction.
although our attrition rates have stabilized and are improving, we face increased competition for talent which may result in longer hire times or increased cost due to the competitive nature of certain positions.
we operate in an industry that requires many of our employees and contractors to possess unique technical skill sets. an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, the mismatch of skill sets to future needs, the unavailability of talent for internal positions and the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges or increased costs. these operating challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development. for example, certain skills, such as those related to construction, maintenance and repair of transmission and distribution systems, are in high demand and have a limited supply. current and prospective employees may determine that they do not wish to work for us due to market, economic, employment or other conditions, including those related to organizational changes as described in the risk factor below.
further, as part of our strategic plan, which includes enhanced technology, transmission and distribution investments, and a reduction in reliance on coal-fired generation, we will need to attract and retain personnel that are qualified to implement such a strategy and may need to retrain or re-skill certain employees to support our long-term objectives. additionally, successful implementation of our strategic plan is dependent on our ability to recruit and retain key executive officers to oversee its progress.
a significant portion of our workforce is subject to collective bargaining agreements. our collective bargaining agreements are generally negotiated on an operating company basis with some companies having multiple bargaining agreements, which may span different geographies. any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to renegotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes, boycotts or other labor disruptions. our workforce continuity plans may not be effective in avoiding work stoppages that may result from labor negotiations or mass resignations. labor disruptions, strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases, whether due to union activities, employee turnover or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows.
failure to attract, retain, or re-skill qualified employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, could result in a loss of momentum, loss of high-level employees to our peers and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. if we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce and maintain satisfactory labor relations, safety, service reliability, customer satisfaction and our results of operations could be adversely affected.
if we cannot effectively manage new initiatives and organizational changes, we will be unable to address the opportunities and challenges presented by our strategy and the business and regulatory environment.
in order to execute on our sustainable growth strategy and enhance our culture of ongoing continuous improvement, we must effectively manage the complexity and frequency of new initiatives and organizational changes. the organizational changes from our transformation initiatives have put short-term pressure on employees due to the volume and pace of change and, in some cases, the loss of personnel. front-line workers are being impacted by the variety of process and technology changes that are currently in progress.
if we are unable to make decisions quickly, assess our opportunities and risks, and successfully implement new governance, managerial and organizational processes as needed to execute our strategy in this increasingly dynamic and competitive business and regulatory environment, our financial condition, results of operations and relationships with our business partners, regulators, customers, employees and stockholders may be negatively impacted.
actions of activist stockholders could negatively affect our business and stock price and cause us to incur significant expenses.
we may be subject to actions or proposals from activist stockholders or others that may not be aligned with our long-term strategy or the interests of our other stockholders. our response to suggested actions, proposals, director nominations and item 1a. risk factors nisource inc.
contests for the election of directors by activist stockholders could disrupt our business and operations, divert the attention of our board of directors, management and employees, and be costly and time‐consuming. potential actions by activist stockholders or others may interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plans; create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy; cause uncertainty with our regulators; make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel; and adversely affect our relationships with our existing and potential business partners. any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. also, we may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to responding to stockholder activism, including for third-party advisors. moreover, our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any stockholder activism.
we outsource certain business functions to third-party suppliers and service providers, and may be impacted by substandard performance or quality by third parties.
utilities rely on extensive networks of business partners and suppliers to support critical enterprise capabilities across their organizations. like other companies in the utilities industry, we outsource certain services to third parties in areas including construction services, information technology, materials, fleet, environmental, operational services, corporate and other areas. we are seeing slowing deliveries from suppliers and in some cases materials and labor shortages for capital projects. in addition to delays and unavailability, at times, outsourcing of services to third parties could expose us to inferior service quality or substandard deliverables, which may result in non-compliance (including with applicable legal requirements and industry standards), interruption of service, accidents, or reputational harm, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. the nature of indirect supply chain, including a potential lack of control or certain visibility into sourcing by vendors, may also impact our ability to serve customers in a safe, reliable and cost-effective manner. these risks include the risk of operational failure, reputation damage, disruption due to new supply chain disruptions, exposure to significant commercial losses and fines and poorly positioned and distressed suppliers. if we continue to see delayed deliveries and shortages or if any other difficulties in the operations of these third-party suppliers and service providers, including their systems, were to occur, they could adversely affect our results of operations, or adversely affect our ability to work with regulators, unions, customers, or employees.
a cyber-attack or security breach on any of our or certain third-party technology systems, including but not limited to information systems, infrastructure, software and hardware, upon which we rely may adversely affect our ability to operate, could lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information, or potential liability.
we are reliant on technology to run our business, which is dependent upon technology systems to process critical information necessary to conduct various elements of our business, including the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity; operation of our gas pipeline facilities; and the recording and reporting of commercial and financial transactions to regulators, investors and other stakeholders. in addition to general information and cybersecurity risks that all large corporations face (e.g., ransomware, malware, unauthorized access attempts, phishing attacks, malicious intent by insiders, third-party software vulnerabilities and inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information), the utility industry faces evolving and increasingly complex cybersecurity risks associated with protecting electric grid and natural gas infrastructure as well as sensitive and confidential customer and employee information. deployment of new business technologies, along with maintaining legacy technology, represents a large-scale opportunity for attacks on our information systems and confidential customer and employee information, as well as on the integrity of the energy grid and the natural gas infrastructure. increasing large-scale corporate cyber-attacks in conjunction with more sophisticated threats continue to challenge power and utility companies. additionally, international conflicts, as well as increased surveillance activity from china, has increased the likelihood of a cyber-attack or security breach on critical infrastructure systems.
additionally, our information systems experience ongoing, often sophisticated, cyber-attacks or security breaches by a variety of sources, including foreign sources, with the apparent aim to breach our cyber-defenses. while we have implemented and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect our information technology, operational technology, and data systems from such cyber-attacks or security breaches, our cybersecurity program does not prevent all breaches, cyber-attack or security breach incidents. we have experienced an increase in the number of attempts by external parties to access our networks or our company data without authorization. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cybersecurity intrusions and attacks or security breaches to our information systems. to our knowledge, none of these intrusions or attacks have resulted in a material cybersecurity intrusion or data breach. the risk of a disruption or breach of our operational technology, or the compromise of the data processed in connection with our operations, through cybersecurity breach or ransomware attack has increased as attempted cyber-attacks or security breaches have advanced in sophistication and number around the world. technological complexities combined with advanced cyber- attack or security breach techniques, lack of cybersecurity hygiene and human error can result in a cybersecurity incident, such as a ransomware attack. supplier non-compliance with item 1a. risk factors nisource inc.
cybersecurity controls can also result in a cybersecurity incident. we are aware of vendor cyber incidents that have impacted our business, although no such events have had a material impact. cyber-attacks or security breaches can occur at any point in the supply chain or with any suppliers, and future supplier non-compliance with cybersecurity controls could result in material cybersecurity incidents. in addition, we use unmanned aircraft systems (uas) or drones in our business operations. uass are also being used for malicious activities and the cybersecurity risk in connection with operating uass is increasing.
in addition, we collect and retain personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. customers and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information. the legal and regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding.
although we attempt to maintain adequate defenses to these cyber-attacks or security breaches and work through industry groups and trade associations to identify common threats and assess our countermeasures, a security breach of our information systems or operational technology, or a security breach of the information systems of our customers, suppliers or others with whom we do business, could (i) adversely impact our ability to safely and reliably deliver electricity and natural gas to our customers through our generation, transmission and distribution systems and potentially negatively impact our compliance with certain mandatory reliability and gas flow standards, (ii) subject us to reputational and other harm or liabilities associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information such as system operating information or information, personal or otherwise, relating to our customers or employees, (iii) impact our ability to manage our businesses, and/or (iv) subject us to legal and regulatory proceedings and claims from third parties, in addition to remediation costs, any of which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects. although we do maintain cybersecurity insurance, it is possible that such insurance will not adequately cover any losses or liabilities we may incur as a result of a cybersecurity incident.
compliance with and changes in cybersecurity requirements have a cost and operational impact on our business, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely impact our reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.
as cyber-attacks or security breaches are becoming more sophisticated, critical infrastructure assets, including pipelines and electric infrastructure, may be specifically targeted. in 2021, the tsa announced two new security directives in response to a ransomware attack on the colonial pipeline that occurred earlier in the year. these directives, including updates or amendments to such tsa directives, require critical pipeline owners to comply with mandatory reporting measures, designate a cybersecurity coordinator, provide vulnerability assessments, and ensure compliance with certain cybersecurity requirements. nisource continues to work with the tsa to ensure that compliance with the security directives are being met. additionally, on november 30, 2022, the tsa issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (anprm) seeking public comment on more comprehensive, formal cybersecurity regulations for the pipeline industry. such directives or additional legal requirements may require expenditure of significant additional resources to respond to cyber-attacks or security breaches, to continue to modify or enhance protective measures, or to assess, investigate and remediate any critical infrastructure security vulnerabilities. increased costs and the operational impacts of compliance and changes in cybersecurity requirements, including any failure to comply with government regulations or any failure in our cybersecurity protective measures may result in enforcement actions, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, there is no certainty that costs incurred related to securing against threats will be recovered through rates.
the impacts of natural disasters, acts of terrorism, acts of war, civil unrest, accidents, public health emergencies or other catastrophic events may disrupt operations and reduce the ability to service customers.
a disruption or failure of natural gas distribution systems, or within electric generation, transmission or distribution systems, in the event of a major hurricane, tornado, wildfire, or other major weather event, or terrorist attack, acts of war, international military invasions, including the political and economic disruption and uncertainty related to such terrorist attack, acts of war, or international military invasions (e.g. russia's military invasion of ukraine, israel/hamas conflict), civil unrest, accident, public health emergency (e.g. pandemic), or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. we have experienced disruptions in the past from hurricanes and tornadoes and other events of this nature. also, companies in our industry face a heightened risk of exposure to and have experienced acts of terrorism and vandalism. our electric and gas physical infrastructure may be targets of physical security threats or terrorist activities that could disrupt our operations. we have increased security given the current environment and may be required by regulators or by the future threat environment to make investments in security that we cannot currently predict. in addition, the supply chain constraints that we are experiencing could impact our ability to timely restore services. the occurrence of such events could materially adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. as a result, the amount and scope item 1a. risk factors nisource inc.
of insurance coverage maintained against losses resulting from any such event may not be sufficient to cover such losses or otherwise adequately compensate for any business disruptions that could result.
we are exposed to significant reputational risks, which make us vulnerable to a loss of cost recovery, increased litigation and negative public perception.
as a utility company, we are subject to adverse publicity focused on the reliability of our services, the speed with which we are able to respond effectively to electric outages, natural gas leaks or events and related accidents and similar interruptions caused by storm damage, physical or cybersecurity incidents, or other unanticipated events, as well as our own or third parties' actions or failure to act. we are subject to prevailing labor markets and potential high attrition, which may impact the speed of our customer service response. we are also facing supply chain challenges, the impacts of which may adversely impact our reputation in several areas as described elsewhere in these risk factors. we are also subject to adverse publicity related to actual or perceived environmental impacts. if customers, legislators or regulators have or develop a negative opinion of us, this could result in less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes or increased regulatory oversight, increased litigation and negative public perception. the foregoing may have adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.
the physical impacts of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon future are impacting our business and could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
climate change is exacerbating risks to our physical infrastructure by increasing the frequency of extreme weather, including heat stresses to power lines, cold temperature stress to our electric and gas systems, and storms and floods that damage infrastructure. in addition, climate change is likely to cause lake and river level changes that affect the manner in which services are currently provided and droughts or other limits on water used to supply services, and other extreme weather conditions. we have adapted and will continue to evolve our infrastructure and operations to meet current and future needs of our stakeholders. with higher frequency of these and other possible extreme weather events it may become more costly for us to safely and reliably deliver certain products and services to our customers. further, as our generation profile increases geographically, it is potentially more vulnerable to certain weather hazards than centralized fossil generation, thereby increasing the frequency of weather impacts to overall electric reliability and such distributed renewables. some of these costs may not be recovered. to the extent that we are unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates arising from recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for services, our future financial results may be adversely impacted. further, as the intensity and frequency of significant weather events increases, insurers may reprice or remove themselves from insuring risks for which the company has historically maintained insurance, resulting in increased cost or risk to us.
our strategy may be impacted by policy and legal, technology, market and reputational risks and opportunities that are associated with the transition to a lower-carbon economy, as disclosed in other risk factors in this section. as a result of increased awareness regarding climate change, coupled with adverse economic conditions, availability of alternative energy sources, including private solar, microturbines, fuel cells, energy-efficient buildings and energy storage devices, and new regulations restricting emissions, including potential regulations of methane emissions, some consumers and companies may use less energy, meet their own energy needs through alternative energy sources or avoid expansions of their facilities, including natural gas facilities, which may result in less demand for our services. as these technologies become a more cost-competitive option over time, whether through cost effectiveness or government incentives and subsidies, certain customers may choose to meet their own energy needs and subsequently decrease usage of our systems and services, which may result in, among other things, our facilities becoming less competitive and economical. further, evolving investor sentiment related to the use of fossil fuels and initiatives to restrict continued production of fossil fuels could result in a significant impact on our electric generation and natural gas businesses in the future.
we are unable to forecast the future of commodity markets. some of our baseload generation is dependent on natural gas and coal, and we pass through the costs for these energy sources to our customers. in addition, in our gas distribution business, we procure natural gas on behalf of certain customers, and we pass through the actual cost of the gas consumed. diminished investor interest in funding fossil fuel development could reduce the amount of exploration and production of natural gas or coal, or investment in gas transmission pipelines. reduced production and transportation of natural gas could, in the long-term, lead to supply shortages leading to baseload generation outages. given that we pass through commodity costs to customers, this could also create the potential for regulatory questions resulting from increased customer costs, reduced fossil fuel investment, due to evolving investor sentiment, could lead to higher commodity prices and shortages impacting our generation and our reputation with regulators. conversely, demand for our services may increase as a result of customer changes in response to climate change. for example, as the utilization of electric vehicles increases, demand for electricity may increase, resulting in increased usage of our systems and services.

any negative views with respect to our environmental practices or our ability to meet the challenges posed by climate change from regulators, customers, investors or legislators could harm our reputation and adversely affect the perceived value of our products and services. changes in policy to combat climate change, and technology advancement, each of which can also accelerate the implications of a transition to a lower carbon economy, may materially adversely impact our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. for example, in february 2023, the maryland office of people's counsel filed a petition with the maryland psc seeking an investigation regarding planning, practices, and future operations of natural gas suppliers in the state and this initiated a proceeding related to near-term, priority actions and comprehensive, long-term planning for maryland's gas companies, and in december 2023 the maryland department of environment proposed a building efficiency performance standard regulation that could require buildings of a certain size and type eliminate scope 1 ghg emissions by 2040.
we are subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities associated with the implementation and efforts to achieve our carbon emission reduction goals.
on november 7, 2022, we announced our goal of reaching net zero scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 (the "net zero goal"). achieving the net zero goal will require supportive regulatory and legislative policies, favorable stakeholder environments and advancement of technologies that are not currently economical to deploy, the impacts and costs of which are not fully understood at this time. nipsco's electric generation transition is a key element of the net zero goal. our analysis and plan for execution, which is outlined in the nipsco 2021 integrated resource plan, requires us to make a number of assumptions. these goals and underlying assumptions involve risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees. should one or more of our underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and ability to achieve our emissions goal could differ materially from our expectations. certain of the assumptions that could impact our ability to meet our emissions goal include, but are not limited to: the accuracy of current emission measurements, service territory size and capacity needs remaining in line with expectations; regulatory approval; impacts of future environmental regulations or legislation; impact of future ghg pricing regulations or legislation, including a future carbon tax or methane fee; price, availability and regulation of carbon offsets; price of fuel, such as natural gas; cost of energy generation technologies, such as wind and solar, natural gas and storage solutions; adoption of alternative energy, including adoption of electric vehicles; rate of technology innovation with regards to alternative energy resources; our ability to implement our modernization plans for our pipelines and facilities; the ability to complete and implement generation alternatives to nipsco's coal generation and retirement dates of nipsco's coal facilities by 2028; the ability to construct and/or permit new natural gas pipelines; the ability to procure resources needed to build at a reasonable cost, the lack of scarcity of resources and labor, project cancellations, construction delays or overruns and the ability to appropriately estimate costs of new generation; impact of any supply chain disruptions; and advancement of energy efficiencies. any negative opinions with respect to these goals or our environmental practices, including any inability to achieve, or a scaling back of these goals, formed by regulators, customers, investors or legislators could harm our reputation and have an adverse effect on our financial condition.
financial, economic and market risks we have substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition.
our business is capital intensive and we rely significantly on long-term debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt, and on short-term borrowings to fund a portion of day-to-day business operations. we had total consolidated indebtedness of $14,127.9 million outstanding as of december 31, 2023. our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. for example, it could:
•limit our ability to borrow additional funds or increase the cost of borrowing additional funds;
•reduce the availability of cash flow from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;
•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the business and the industries in which we operate;
•lead parties with whom we do business to require additional credit support, such as letters of credit, in order for us to transact such business;
•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that are less leveraged;
•increase vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and
•limit our ability to execute on our growth strategy, which is dependent upon access to capital to fund our substantial infrastructure investment program.
some of our debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debt-to-capital ratios and cross-default provisions. our failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations. additionally, non-compliance with debt covenants could adversely affect our item 1a. risk factors nisource inc.
ability to obtain future borrowings and as a result materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.
a drop in our credit ratings could adversely impact our cash flows, results of operation, financial condition and liquidity.
the availability and cost of credit for our businesses may be greatly affected by credit ratings. the credit rating agencies periodically review our ratings, taking into account factors such as our capital structure, earnings profile, and overall shifts in the economy or business environment. we are committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings; however, there is no assurance we will be able to do so in the future. our credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, the circumstances warrant. any negative rating action could adversely affect our ability to access capital at rates and on terms that are attractive. a negative rating action could also adversely impact our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners, who may be less willing to extend credit or offer us similarly favorable terms as secured in the past under such circumstances.
certain of our subsidiaries have agreements that contain "ratings triggers" that require increased collateral in the form of cash, a letter of credit or other forms of security for new and existing transactions if our credit ratings (including the standalone credit ratings of certain of our subsidiaries) are dropped below investment grade. these agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of gas or power. as of december 31, 2023, the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $90.1 million. in addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain "adequate assurance" or "material adverse change" provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business.
if our or certain of our subsidiaries' credit ratings were downgraded, especially below investment grade, financing costs and the principal amount of borrowings would likely increase due to the additional risk of our debt and because certain counterparties may require additional credit support as described above. such amounts may be material and could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. losing investment grade credit ratings may also result in more restrictive covenants and reduced flexibility on repayment terms in debt issuances, lower share price and greater stockholder dilution from common equity issuances, in addition to reputational damage within the investment community.
adverse economic and market conditions, including increases in inflation or interest rates, recession or changes in investor sentiment could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity.
deteriorating, sluggish or volatile economic conditions in our operating jurisdictions could adversely impact our ability to maintain or grow our customer base and collect revenues from customers, which could reduce our revenue or growth rate and increase operating costs. a continued economic downturn or recession, or slowing or stalled recovery from such economic downturn or recession, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
we rely on access to the capital markets to finance our liquidity and long-term capital requirements, including expenditures for our utility infrastructure and to comply with future regulatory requirements, to the extent not satisfied by the cash flow generated by our operations. we have historically relied on long-term debt and on the issuance of equity securities to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt, and on short-term borrowings to fund a portion of day-to-day business operations. actions to reduce inflation, including raising interest rates, increase our cost of borrowing, which in turn could make it more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments on favorable terms. successful implementation of our long-term business strategies, including capital investment, is dependent upon our ability to access the capital and credit markets, including the banking and commercial paper markets, on competitive terms and rates. an economic downturn or uncertainty, market turmoil, changes in interest rates, changes in tax policy, challenges faced by financial institutions, changes in our credit ratings, or a change in investor sentiment toward us or the utilities industry generally could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt. for example, because nipsco's current generating facilities substantially rely on coal for its operations, certain financial institutions may choose not to participate in our financing arrangements. in addition, large institutional investors may choose to sell or choose not to purchase our stock due to environmental, social and governance ("esg") concerns or concerns regarding renewable energy supply chain challenges. reduced access to capital markets, increased borrowing costs, and/or lower equity valuation levels could reduce future earnings per share and cash flows. in addition, any rise in interest rates may lead to higher borrowing costs, which may adversely impact reported earnings, cost of capital and capital holdings.
item 1a. risk factors nisource inc.
if, in the future, we face limits to the credit and capital markets or experience significant increases in the cost of capital or are unable to access the capital markets, it could limit our ability to implement, or increase the costs of implementing, our business plan, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity.
most of our revenues are subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedings.
most of our revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level. as such, the revenues generated by us are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority. these rate reviews determine the rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues. our financial results are dependent on frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs and investments. as described in more detail in the risk factor below, the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain, potentially lengthy and could be influenced by many factors, some of which may be outside of our control, including the cost of providing service, the necessity of expenditures, the quality of service, regulatory interpretations, customer intervention, economic conditions and the political environment. further, the rate orders are subject to appeal, which creates additional uncertainty as to the rates that will ultimately be allowed to be charged for services.
the actions of regulators and legislators could result in outcomes that may adversely affect our earnings and liquidity.
the rates that our electric and natural gas companies charge their customers are determined by their state regulatory commissions and by the ferc. these state regulatory commissions also regulate the companies' accounting, operations, the issuance of certain securities and certain other matters. the ferc also regulates the transmission of electric energy, the sale of electric energy at wholesale, accounting, issuance of certain securities and certain other matters, including reliability standards through the north american electric reliability corporation (nerc).
under state and federal law, our electric and natural gas companies are entitled to charge rates that are sufficient to allow them an opportunity to recover their prudently incurred operating and capital costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, to attract needed capital and maintain their financial integrity, while also protecting relevant public interests. our electric and natural gas companies are required to engage in regulatory approval proceedings as a part of the process of establishing the terms and rates for their respective services. each of these companies prepares and submits periodic rate filings with their respective regulatory commissions for review and approval, which allows for various entities to challenge our current or future rates, structures or mechanisms and could alter or limit the rates we are allowed to charge our customers. these proceedings typically involve multiple parties, including governmental bodies and officials, consumer advocacy groups, and various consumers of energy, who have differing interests. any change in rates, including changes in allowed rate of return, are subject to regulatory approval proceedings that can be contentious, lengthy, and subject to appeal. this may lead to uncertainty as to the ultimate result of those proceedings. established rates are also subject to subsequent prudency reviews by state regulators, whereby various portions of rates could be adjusted, subject to refund or disallowed, including cost recovery mechanisms. the ultimate outcome and timing of regulatory rate proceedings could have a significant effect on our ability to recover costs or earn an adequate return. adverse decisions in our proceedings could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
there can be no assurance that regulators will approve the recovery of all costs incurred by our electric and natural gas companies, including costs for construction, operation and maintenance, and compliance with current and future changes in environmental, federal pipeline safety, critical infrastructure and cyber-security laws and regulations. challenges arise with state regulators on inflationary pricing for electric and gas materials and potential price increases, ensuring that updated pricing for electric and gas materials is included in plans and regulatory assumptions, and ensuring there is a regulatory recovery model. there is debate among state regulators and other stakeholders over how to transition to a decarbonized economy and prudency arguments relative to investing in natural gas assets when the depreciable life of the assets may be shortened due to electrification. the inability to recover a significant amount of operating costs could have an adverse effect on a company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
changes to rates may occur at times different from when costs are incurred. additionally, catastrophic events at other utilities could result in our regulators and legislators imposing additional requirements that may lead to additional costs or operational requirements for the companies.
in addition to the risk of disallowance of incurred costs, regulators may also impose downward adjustments in a company's allowed roe as well as assess penalties and fines. regulators may reduce roe to mitigate potential customer bill increases due to items unrelated to capital investments. these actions would have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
item 1a. risk factors nisource inc.
our electric business is subject to mandatory reliability and critical infrastructure protection standards established by nerc and enforced by the ferc. the critical infrastructure protection standards focus on controlling access to critical physical and cybersecurity assets. compliance with the mandatory reliability standards could subject our electric utilities to higher operating costs. in addition, compliance with phmsa regulations, including the expected final ruling around leak detection and repair requirements could subject our gas utilities to higher operating costs and divert business resources from other activities in order to remain compliant. if our businesses are found to be in noncompliance, we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, or damage to our reputation.
changes in tax laws, as well as the potential tax effects of business decisions, could negatively impact our business, results of operations (including our expected project returns from our planned renewable energy projects), financial condition and cash flows.
our business operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industries.
business operations throughout our service territories have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic events at the national and local level where our businesses operate. in particular, sales to large industrial customers, such as those in the steel, oil refining, industrial gas and related industries, are impacted by economic downturns and recession; geographic or technological shifts in production or production methods; and consumer demand for environmentally friendly products and practices. the u.s. manufacturing industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, inflation and increasing costs, government and societal pressure to decarbonization, and fluctuating demand for its products. in addition, our results of operations are negatively impacted by lower revenues resulting from higher bankruptcies, predominately focused on commercial and industrial customers not able to sustain operations through the economic disruptions related to the pandemic.
we are exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services, and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating agreements.
our extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy, involves judgment by our employees and is based on an evaluation of customer, supplier, or counterparty's financial condition, credit history and other factors. we monitor our credit risk exposure by obtaining credit reports and updated financial information for customers and suppliers, and by evaluating the financial status of our banking partners and other counterparties by reference to market-based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and to traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. adverse economic conditions could result in an increase in defaults by customers, suppliers and counterparties we are also exposed to the risk that due to adverse economic conditions one or more suppliers or counterparties may fail or delay the performance of their contractual obligations. such risks could negatively impact our business, financial condition and cash flow.
we are a holding company and are dependent on cash generated by our subsidiaries to meet our debt obligations and pay dividends on our stock.
we are a holding company and conduct our operations primarily through our subsidiaries, which are separate and distinct legal entities. substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by our subsidiaries. accordingly, our ability to meet our debt obligations or pay dividends on our common stock and preferred stock is largely dependent upon cash generated by these subsidiaries. in the event a major subsidiary is not able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to us, our ability to service our debt obligations or pay dividends could be negatively affected.
capital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require significant additional funding and impact earnings.
the performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. we have significant obligations in these areas and hold significant assets in these trusts. these assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns, which could fall below our projected rates of return. a decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension plans. additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, which could potentially increase funding requirements. further, the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or longer life expectancy assumptions, as well as voluntary early retirements. in addition, lower asset returns result in increased expenses. ultimately, significant funding requirements and increased pension or other postretirement benefit plan expenses could negatively impact our results of operations and financial position.
we have significant goodwill. any future impairments of goodwill could result in a significant charge to earnings in a future period and negatively impact our compliance with certain covenants under financing agreements.
item 1a. risk factors nisource inc.
in accordance with gaap, we test goodwill for impairment at least annually and review our definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate its fair value might be below its carrying value. goodwill is also tested for impairment when factors, examples of which include reduced cash flow estimates, a sustained decline in stock price or market capitalization below book value, indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and results in a significant charge to earnings. we cannot predict the timing, magnitude, or duration of such changes. in general, the carrying value of goodwill would not be recoverable, in which case we may record a non-cash impairment charge, which could materially impact our results of operations and financial position.
a significant impairment charge in the future could impact the capitalization ratio covenant under certain financing agreements. we are subject to a financial covenant under our revolving credit facility, which requires us to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. as of december 31, 2023, the ratio was 58.2%.
litigation, regulatory and legislative risks the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations, inquiries, claims and litigation related to our business operations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
we are, or may be, involved in legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations, inquiries, claims and litigation in connection with our business operations, the most significant of which are summarized in, note 19, "other commitments and contingencies," in the notes to consolidated financial statements. while we have insurance, it may not cover all costs or expenses incurred relating to litigation. due to the inherent uncertainty of the outcomes of such matters, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.
our businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations, tariffs and policies and a failure to comply with changes in, or new or different interpretations of, such laws, regulations, tariffs and policies could have an adverse impact on our business.
our businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations, tariffs and policies, including, but not limited to, those relating to natural gas pipeline safety, employee safety, the environment and our energy infrastructure. in particular, we are subject to significant federal, state and local regulations applicable to utility companies, including regulations by the various utility commissions in the states where we serve customers. these regulations significantly influence our operating environment, may affect our ability to recover costs from utility customers, and cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs. existing laws, regulations, tariffs and policies may be revised or become subject to new interpretations, and new laws, regulations, tariffs and policies may be adopted or become applicable to us and our operations. in some cases, compliance with new or different laws, regulations, tariffs and policies increases our costs or risks of liability. supply chain constraints may challenge our ability to remain in compliance if we cannot obtain the materials that we need to operate our business in a compliant manner. if we fail to comply with laws, regulations and tariffs applicable to us or with any changes in or new interpretations of such laws, regulations, tariffs or policies, our financial condition, results of operations, regulatory outcomes and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.
our businesses are regulated under numerous environmental laws and regulations. the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations, and changes to or additions to, or reinterpretations of the laws and regulations, could be significant, and the cost of compliance may not be recoverable. liability from the failure to comply with existing or changed laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
our businesses are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and rules that regulate, among other things, air emissions, water usage and discharges, leak detection and repair, ghg and waste products such as ccr. compliance with these legal obligations require us to make significant expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment, remediation, environmental monitoring, emissions fees, and permits at many of our facilities. furthermore, if we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or are found to have caused damage to the environment or persons, that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against us, injunctions to remedy the failure or harm, and the inability to operate facilities as designed and intended. further, failing to comply with such laws and regulations or a determination that we have caused damage to the environment or persons, could result in reputational damage.
existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us, with an increasing focus on the impact of coal and natural gas facilities that may result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on our facilities, which may not be fully recoverable from customers and could materially affect the continued economic viability of our facilities.
item 1a. risk factors nisource inc.
an area of significant uncertainty and risk are potential changes to the laws concerning emission of ghg. while we continue to execute our plan to reduce our scope 1 ghg emissions through the retirement of coal-fired electric generation, increased sourcing of renewable energy, priority pipeline replacement, leak detection and repair, and other methods, and while we have set a net zero goal, ghg emissions are anticipated to be associated with energy delivery for many years. future ghg legislation and/or regulation related to the generation of electricity or the extraction, production, distribution, transmission, storage and end use of natural gas could materially impact our gas supply, financial position, financial results and cash flows.
another area of significant uncertainty and risk are the regulations concerning ccr. the epa has issued regulations and plans to promulgate additional regulations concerning the management, transformation, transportation and storage of ccrs. nipsco is also incurring or will incur costs associated with closing, corrective action, and ongoing monitoring of certain ccr impoundments. further, a release of ccr to the environment could result in remediation costs, penalties, claims, litigation, increased compliance costs, and reputational damage.
we currently have a pending application with the epa to continue operation of a ccr impoundment that is tied to operation of r.m. schahfer generating station units 17 and 18 to the end of 2025, with the ccr impoundment closing by october 2028. in proposed and final epa actions denying continued operation of ccr impoundments at other utilities, epa said that ccr impoundments should cease receipt of ccrs within 135 days of final epa action unless certain conditions are demonstrated, such as potential reliability issues. in the event that approval is not obtained, future operations could be impacted.
the actual future expenditures to achieve environmental compliance depends on many factors, including the nature and extent of impact, the method of improvement, the cost of raw materials, contractor costs, and requirements established by environmental authorities. changes or increases in costs and the ability to recover under regulatory mechanisms could affect our financial position, financial results and cash flows.
changes in tax laws or the interpretation thereof and challenges to tax positions could adversely affect our financial results.
we are subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the federal, state and local levels where we do business. legislation or regulation which could affect our tax burden could be enacted or interpreted by any of these governmental authorities. the ira imposed a 15 percent minimum tax rate on book earnings for corporations with higher than $1 billion of annual income, along with a 1 percent excise tax on corporate stock repurchases while providing tax incentives to promote various clean energy initiatives. separately, a challenge by a taxing authority, changes in taxing authorities' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions, our ability to utilize tax benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits, or a deviation from other tax-related assumptions may cause actual financial results to deviate from previous estimates.

this management's discussion is designed to provide an understanding of our operations and financial performance and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k.
we are an energy holding company under the public utility holding company act of 2005 whose subsidiaries are fully regulated natural gas and electric utility companies serving customers in six states. we generate substantially all of our operating income through these rate-regulated businesses, which are summarized for financial reporting purposes into two primary reportable segments: gas distribution operations and electric operations.
refer to the "business" section under item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k and note 21, "business segment information," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our regulated utility business segments.
our goal is to develop strategies that benefit all stakeholders as we (i) focus on long-term infrastructure investment and safety programs to better serve our customers, (ii) align our tariff structures with our cost structure, and (iii) address changing customer energy demand. these strategies focus on improving safety and reliability, enhancing customer experience, pursuing regulatory and legislative initiatives to increase accessibility for customers currently not on our gas and electric service, ensuring customer affordability and reducing emissions while generating sustainable returns. the safety of our customers, communities and employees remains our focus. serving as a guiding practice for our sms, nisource is certified in conformance to the american petroleum institute recommended practice 1173, which is the foundation to our journey towards operational excellence.
2023 overview: in 2023, we continued to make significant progress towards our strategic and financial goals and objectives by achieving in-service status in june 2023 and substantial completion in august 2023 for our first two solar bta projects, indiana crossroads solar and dunns bridge i. we continue to progress on the remaining portfolio of projects that will enable our electric generation transition. during the year, we received orders for four cases: columbia of virginia, columbia of ohio, columbia of maryland, and nipsco electric. in addition, the nipsco gas rate case filed in 2023 is anticipated to be resolved in the third quarter of 2024. these cases represent balanced outcomes supporting all stakeholders. between our gas distribution and electric operating segments, we added 22,000 customers. we also invested $1.5 billion in infrastructure modernization to enhance safe, reliable service, including replacement of 339 miles of distribution main and service lines, 34 miles of underground cable and 1,942 electric poles.
we also made advancements in key strategic initiatives, described in further detail below.
your energy, your future: we continue to advance your energy, your future primarily through the continuation and enhancement of existing programs, such as retiring and replacing remaining coal-fired electric generation by 2028 with a balanced mix of low or zero-emission electric generation, ongoing pipe replacement and modernization programs, and deployment of advanced leak detection and repair. our electric generation transition, initiated through our 2018 integrated resource plan ("2018 plan") is well underway, and we are continually adjusting to the dynamic energy landscape. as of item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
nisource inc.
december 31, 2023, we have executed and received iurc approval for btas and ppas with a combined nameplate capacity of 1,950 mw and 1,400 mw, respectively, under the 2018 plan. we have also taken contractual actions on a number of our other renewable projects to address the timing of these projects as well as consider the broad market issues facing the industry. we remain on track to retire r.m schahfer's remaining two coal units by the end of 2025. on january 1, 2023, the provisions of the ira became effective. on january 17, 2024, the iurc approved full ownership of the cavalry and dunns bridge ii projects, allowing nipsco to leverage provisions of the ira to monetize tax credits for the benefit of customers in lieu of utilizing tax equity partnerships. we are evaluating the impact of this legislation on our remaining projects, with potential to drive increased value to customers. for additional information, see "results and discussion of operations - electric operations," in this management's discussion.
in 2021, we announced and filed with the iurc the preferred energy resource plan associated with our 2021 integrated resource plan ("2021 plan"). the 2021 plan lays out a timeline to retire the michigan city generating station by the end of 2028. the 2021 plan calls for the replacement of the retiring units with a diverse portfolio of resources including demand side management resources, incremental solar, stand-alone energy storage and upgrades to existing facilities at the sugar creek generating station, among other steps. additionally, the 2021 plan calls for a new natural gas peaking facility to replace existing vintage gas peaking facilities at the r.m. schahfer generating station to support system reliability and resiliency, and upgrades to to the electric transmission system. in september of 2023, we filed a request for issuance of a certificate of public convenience and necessity for an approximately 400 mw natural gas peaking generation facility with the iurc. the planned retirement of the two vintage gas peaking facilities at the r.m. schahfer generating station is also expected to occur by the end of 2028. final retirement dates for these units, as well as michigan city, will be subject to miso approval.
we continue to enhance safety and reduce methane emissions on our gas systems through modernization programs and utilization of advanced leak detection and repair. advanced mobile methane-detection vehicles are being deployed across our service territory. these vehicles are designed to identify potential natural gas leaks using proven technology that is more sensitive than traditional leak-detection equipment. resources like these vehicles are advancing the company's commitment to safety and reaching our goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040.
in addition, we plan to advance other low- or zero-emission energy resources and technologies, such as hydrogen and renewable natural gas. in 2023, we launched a multi-phase pilot project at the columbia gas of pennsylvania training center's safety town to better understand the impact of blending hydrogen into the natural gas system. we have partnered with outside experts to conduct a series of field trials blending hydrogen with the natural gas system at various percentages. the blending system allows blending from 0% to 20% hydrogen, by volume. the field trials have initially focused on the customer experience and are now moving toward system operations and other procedures. this pilot is designed to help us understand hydrogen blending into the natural gas system, identify best practices, and analyze the operational and safety impact on company infrastructure and customer appliances. carbon offsets and renewable energy credits may also be used to assist with achieving ghg reductions and our net zero goal.
nipsco minority interest transaction: on december 31, 2023, we consummated the closing of the nipsco minority interest transaction and issued the 19.9% equity interest in nipsco holdings ii to bip in exchange for a capital contribution of $2.16 billion in cash. refer to note 4, "noncontrolling interest," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on this transaction.
transformation: our enterprise-wide transformation roadmap focuses on operational excellence, safety, operation and maintenance management, and unlocking efficiencies. we are committed to identifying and implementing initiatives that will enable us to streamline work and improve logistics company-wide. these efforts include investments in proven technologies backed with standardized processes that will change the way we plan, schedule, and execute work in the field and how we engage and provide service to our customers. taken together, all of our optimization initiatives will prioritize safety and continue to optimize our long-term growth profile.
economic environment: we continue to monitor risks related to order and delivery lead times for construction and other materials, potential unavailability of materials due to global shortages in raw materials, and decreased construction labor productivity in the event of disruptions in the availability of materials. we continue to see increasing prices associated with certain materials and supplies. to the extent that work plan delays occur or our costs increase, our business operations, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. refer to item 1a. risk factors, "financial, economic and market risks" of this annual report on form 10-k for further detail.
we are faced with increased competition for employee and contractor talent in the current labor market which has resulted in increased costs to attract and retain talent. we are ensuring that we use all internal human capital programs (development, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

leadership enablement programs, succession, performance management) to promote retention of our current employees along with having a competitive and attractive appeal for potential recruits. with a focus on workforce planning, we are evaluating our future talent footprint by creating flexible work arrangements where possible to ensure we have the right people, in the right role, and at the right time. refer to item 1a. risk factors, "operational risks" of this annual report on form 10-k for further detail.
the market price of natural gas has been stable during the last half of 2023 at lower levels than 2022 and with little volatility. similar to natural gas pricing, electric commodity costs have stayed subdued due to plentiful supplies of natural gas and coal and the growing influence of renewable generation on power market pricing. changes in commodity prices do not have a material impact on our results of operations, however higher commodity prices can impact our cash flows and liquidity. for more information on our commodity price impacts, see item 1a. risk factors, "operational risks" of this annual report on form 10-k, "results and discussion of segment operations - gas distribution operations," "results and discussion of segment operations - electric operations," and "market risk disclosures."
due to rising interest rates, we experienced higher interest expense during 2023 compared to 2022 associated with short-term borrowings. we continue to evaluate our financing plan to manage interest expense and exposure to rates. for more information on interest rate risk, see "market risk disclosures" and item 1a. risk factors, "financial, economic and market risks" of this annual report on form 10-k.

the majority of the costs of energy in both segments are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer, resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in operating revenues.
the decrease in net income available to common shareholders during 2023 was primarily due to lower revenue resulting from the effects of weather, the receipt of the insurance settlement related to the greater lawrence incident in 2022, higher other deductions due to higher interest expense in 2023, partially offset by lower tax expense and favorable impact from net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest. the decrease in preferred dividends during 2023 was due primarily to the redemption of series a preferred stock in the second quarter 2023. see note 6, "equity," for additional information.

other deductions, net the change in other deductions, net in 2023 compared to 2022 is primarily driven by higher long-term and short-term debt interest in 2023 and higher non-service pension costs offset by increases in afudc. see note 7, "short-term borrowings," note 8, "long-term debt," and note 16, "pension and other postemployment benefits," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
income taxes the decrease in income tax expense in 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 is primarily attributable to lower pre-tax income.
refer to note 15, "income taxes," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes and the change in the effective tax rate.
results and discussion of operations presentation of segment information our operations are divided into two primary reportable segments: gas distribution operations and electric operations. the remainder of our operations, which are not significant enough on a stand-alone basis to warrant treatment as an operating segment, are presented as "corporate and other" within the notes to the consolidated financial statements and primarily are comprised of interest expense on holding company debt, and unallocated corporate costs and activities.

weather in general, we calculate the weather-related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days, net of weather normalization mechanisms. our composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather-related dollar impact on the results of gas distribution operations. heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. when the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather-related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in our aggregated composite heating degree day comparison.
throughput the decrease in total volumes sold and transported in 2023 compared to 2022 of 24.7 mmdth is primarily attributable to the effects of warmer weather offset by increased industrial usage.

gas distribution operations (continued)
commodity price impact cost of energy for the gas distribution operations segment is principally comprised of the cost of natural gas used while providing transportation and distribution services to customers. all of our gas distribution operations companies have state-approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. these are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer, and the gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period. the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as under-recovered or over-recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. therefore, increases in these tracked operating expenses are offset by increases in operating revenues and have essentially no impact on net income. certain gas distribution operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third-party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions.

weather in general, we calculate the weather-related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal cooling degree days. our composite cooling degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather-related dollar impact on the results of electric operations. cooling degree days experienced during different times of the year may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when they occur. when the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather-related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in our aggregated composite cooling degree day comparison.
sales nipsco's electric segment results remains closely linked to the performance of the steel industry. mwh sales to steel-related industries accounted for approximately 49.3% and 47.4% of the total industrial mwh sales for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
commodity price impact cost of energy for the electric operations segment is principally comprised of the cost of coal, natural gas purchased for internal generation of electricity at nipsco, and the cost of power purchased from generators of electricity. nipsco has a state-approved recovery mechanism that provides a means for full recovery of prudently incurred costs of energy. the majority of these costs of energy are passed through directly to the customer, and the costs of energy included in operating revenues are matched with the cost of energy expense recorded in the period. the difference is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as under-recovered or over-recovered fuel cost to be included in future customer billings. therefore, increases in these tracked operating expenses are offset by increases in operating revenues and have essentially no impact on net income.

electric supply and generation transition nipsco continues to execute on an electric generation transition consistent with the 2018 plan and 2021 plan, which outline the path to retire the remaining two coal units at r.m. schahfer by the end of 2025 and the remaining coal-fired generation at michigan city by the end of 2028, to be replaced by lower-cost, reliable and cleaner options. see "project status" discussion, below, and "liquidity and capital resources" in this management's discussion for information on anticipated in-service dates related to our electric generation transition and additional information on our capital investment spend.
nipsco continues to work with the epa to obtain an administrative approval associated with the operation of r.m. schahfer's remaining two coal units until 2025. in the event that the approval is not obtained, future operations could be impacted. we cannot estimate the financial impact on us if this approval is not obtained. refer to item 1a. risk factors, "operational risks," of this annual report on form 10-k for further detail.
the current replacement plan is aligned with the preferred energy resource plan outlined in the 2021 plan and primarily includes renewable sources of energy, including wind, solar, battery storage, and flexible natural gas resources to be obtained through a combination of nipsco ownership and ppas. nipsco has sold, and may in the future sell, renewable energy credits from its renewable generation to third parties to offset customer costs. nipsco has executed several ppas to purchase 100% of the output from renewable generation facilities at a fixed price per mwh. each facility supplying the energy will have an associated nameplate capacity, and payments under the ppas will not begin until the associated generation facility is constructed by the owner/seller. nipsco has also executed several btas with developers to construct renewable generation facilities.
since 2020, two wind ppa projects, two wind bta projects and two solar bta projects have been placed into service, totaling 1,465 mw of nameplate capacity. nipsco has executed commercial agreements for each of the eight remaining identified projects. dunns bridge ii, cavalry, fairbanks, gibson, greenriver, appleseed, carpenter and templeton have received iurc approval. additional approvals by the iurc may be required to obtain recovery for increases in projects costs. nipsco has filed for a new gas peaking facility to be located at r.m. schahfer generating station. on november 22, 2023 the iurc approved nipsco's request to convert the gibson project from a ppa to a bta. on january 17, 2024 the iurc approved increases to the project costs as well as the full ownership of cavalry and dunns bridge ii, allowing nipsco to leverage provisions of the ira to monetize tax credits for the benefit of customers in lieu of utilizing tax equity partnerships. see "executive summary - your energy, your future" in this management's discussion for additional information.

(1) under the structure approved by the iurc ownership of fairbanks and gibson will be transferred to jvs whose members are expected to include nipsco and an unrelated tax equity partner. nipsco is evaluating leveraging provisions of the ira to monetize tax credits for the benefit of customers in lieu of utilizing tax equity partnerships. nipsco may seek iurc approval for full ownership of the fairbanks and gibson projects.
project status. we expect the majority of our remaining bta and ppa projects to be placed in service in 2024 and 2025. our contract amendments for these projects formally address inflationary cost pressures communicated from the developers of our solar and storage projects that are primarily due to (i) limited supply of solar panels and other uncertainties related to the u.s. department of commerce investigation on antidumping and countervailing duties petition filed by a domestic solar manufacturer (the "doc investigation"), (ii) the u.s. department of homeland security's june 2021 withhold release order on silica-based products made by hoshine silicon industry co., ltd./uyghur forced labor prevention act, (iii) section 201 tariffs and (iv) persistent general global supply chain and labor availability issues. we are actively monitoring progress towards project milestones for each of our remaining projects.
in june 2022, the biden administration announced a 24-month tariff relief on solar panels subject to the doc investigation and authorized the use of the defense production act, to accelerate domestic production of clean energy technologies, including solar panel parts. on august 18, 2023, the department of commerce issued final determinations in the doc investigation and affirmed that tariff relief announced by the biden administration in june 2022 would remain in effect until june 2024. at this time, we do not anticipate any significant panel tariffs will impact our solar projects.

liquidity and capital resources we continually evaluate the availability of adequate financing to fund our ongoing business operations, working capital and core safety and infrastructure investment programs. our financing is sourced through cash flow from operations and the issuance of debt and/or equity. external debt financing is provided primarily through the issuance of long-term debt, accounts receivable securitization programs and our $1.85 billion commercial paper program, which is backstopped by our committed revolving credit facility with a total availability from third-party lenders of $1.85 billion. we entered into a $1.0 billion term agreement in the fourth quarter of 2022 and a $650.0 million term credit agreement in the fourth quarter of 2023. on january 3, 2024, we terminated and repaid in full our $1.0 billion term credit agreement and our $650.0 million term credit agreement. on march 24, 2023, we completed the issuance and sale of $750.0 million of 5.25% senior unsecured notes maturing in 2028, which resulted in approximately $742.2 million of net proceeds after discount and debt issuance costs. on june 8, 2023, we completed the issuance and sale of a reopening of $300.0 million of 5.25% senior unsecured notes maturing in 2028 and $450.0 million of 5.40% senior unsecured notes maturing in 2033, which resulted in approximately $742.5 million of net proceeds after discount and debt issuance costs. on june 15, 2023, we redeemed all 400,000 shares of series a preferred stock for a redemption price of $1,000 per share, or $400.0 million in total. as of december 31, 2023, the atm program and the associated equity distribution agreements expired. on december 31, 2023, we consummated the nipsco minority interest transaction in exchange for a capital contribution of $2.16 billion in cash. see note 4, "noncontrolling interest,", note 6, "equity," note 7, "short-term borrowings," and note 8, "long-term debt," in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
we believe these sources provide adequate capital to fund our operating activities and capital expenditures in 2024 and beyond.
operating activities net cash from operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2023 was $1,935.1 million, an increase of $525.7 million from 2022. this increase in cash from operating activities was primarily driven by year over year change in accounts receivable collections driven by the implementation of new rates and the impact of lower gas prices as compared to 2022, partially offset by lower accounts payables also driven by lower gas prices.
investing activities net cash used for investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2023 was $3,571.6 million, an increase of $1,001.4 million from 2022. our current year investing activities were comprised of increased capital expenditures related to system growth and reliability as well as payments to renewable generation asset developers related to milestone payments for certain of our bta projects in 2023, as well as the property insurance settlement related to the greater lawrence incident received in the prior year.

(1)amounts differ from those presented in note 21, "business segment information," in the notes to consolidated financial statements due to the allocation of corporate and other maintenance costs to the gas distribution and electric operations segments.
(2)amounts differ from those presented on the statements of consolidated cash flows primarily due to the capitalized portion of the corporate incentive plan payout, inclusion of capital expenditures included in current liabilities and afudc equity.
in addition to these capital expenditures, we made $871.2 million of capital investments in the form of milestone and final payments to the renewable generation asset developers. through december 2023, nisource has added approximately $1 billion in renewable generation projects to its rate base.
we expect to make capital investments totaling approximately $16.0 billion during the 2024-2028 period related to infrastructure modernization, generation transition and customer growth over the next five years. this forecast incorporates an estimated $1.7 billion of additional investment in renewable generation projects.

equity. our authorized capital stock consists of 770,000,000 shares, $0.01 par value, of which 750,000,000 are common stock and 20,000,000 are preferred stock. as of december 31, 2023, 447,381,671 shares of common stock and 40,000 shares of preferred stock were outstanding. for more information regarding our common and preferred stock, see note 6, "equity," in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
contractual obligations, cash requirements and off-balance sheet arrangements we have certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. our material cash requirements are detailed below. we intend to use funds from the liquidity sources referenced above to meet these cash requirements.
at december 31, 2023, we had $11,079.3 million in long-term debt and $3,048.6 million in short-term borrowings outstanding.
during 2024 and 2025, we expect to make cash payments of $652.0 million and $485.7 million, respectively, related to pipeline service obligations including demand for gas transportation, gas storage and gas purchases.
our expected payments include employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2024. plan contributions beyond 2024 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated at this time. in 2024, we expect to make contributions of approximately $2.2 million to our pension plans and approximately $23.1 million to our postretirement medical and life plans. refer to note 16, "pension and other postemployment benefits," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.
we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to certain of our long-term obligations classified as "total other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets.

"other matters - generation transition," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
in addition, we, along with certain of our subsidiaries, enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. such agreements include guarantees and stand-by letters of credit.

market risk disclosures risk is an inherent part of our businesses. the extent to which we properly and effectively identify, assess, monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in our businesses is critical to our profitability. we seek to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal market risks that are involved in our businesses: commodity price risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. we manage risk through a multi-faceted process with oversight by the risk management committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. our senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. these may include, but are not limited to market, operational, financial, compliance and strategic risk types. in recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, our risk management process, policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification.
commodity price risk our gas and electric operations have commodity price risk primarily related to the purchases of natural gas and power. to manage this market risk, our subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps, forwards and options. we do not participate in speculative energy trading activity.
commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at our rate-regulated subsidiaries is limited and does not bear significant exposure to earnings risk, since our current regulatory mechanisms allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate-making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. these changes are included in the gca and fac regulatory rate-recovery mechanisms. if these mechanisms were to be adjusted or item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

eliminated, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate-making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. for additional information, see "results and discussion of operations" in this management's discussion.
certain of our subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. the amount of these deposits, some of which are reflected in our restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets.
refer to note 13, "risk management activities," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our commodity price risk assets and liabilities as of december 31, 2023 and 2022.
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program, term credit agreements and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short-term market interest rates. based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short-term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $18.9 million and $8.7 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively. we are also exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in benchmark rates that can influence the interest rates of future debt issuances. from time to time, we may enter into forward interest rate instruments to lock in long term interest costs and/ or rates.
credit risk due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of our business activities. our extension of credit is governed by a corporate credit risk policy. in addition, risk management committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. exposures to credit risks are monitored by the risk management function, which is independent of commercial operations. credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. for derivative-related contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to us at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash and letters of credit.
we evaluate the financial status of our banking partners through the use of market-based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by major credit rating agencies.
other information critical accounting estimates we apply certain accounting policies in accordance with gaap, which require that we make estimates and judgments that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on our operations and consolidated financial statements. we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates. we believe the following represent the more significant items requiring the use of judgment in preparing our consolidated financial statements:
basis of accounting for rate-regulated subsidiaries. asc topic 980, regulated operations, provides that rate-regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be billed and collected. accordingly, certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income may be deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. the total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets were $2,460.2 million and $1,789.3 million at december 31, 2023, and $2,580.8 million and $2,012.6 million at december 31, 2022, respectively. for additional information, refer to note 12, "regulatory matters," in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for us to recover our costs in the future, all or a portion of our regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of asc topic 980, regulated operations. in such item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

event, a write-down of all or a portion of our existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. if transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under gaap for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. if we were unable to continue to apply the provisions of asc topic 980, regulated operations, we would be required to apply the provisions of asc topic 980-20, discontinuation of rate-regulated accounting. in management's opinion, our regulated subsidiaries will be subject to asc topic 980, regulated operations for the foreseeable future.
certain of the regulatory assets reflected on our consolidated balance sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, we believe that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. if we determine that the amounts included as regulatory assets are no longer probable of recovery, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts.
one of the more significant items recorded through the application of this accounting guidance is the regulatory overlay for jv accounting. the application of hlbv to consolidated vies generally results in the recognition of profit from the related jvs over a time frame that is different from when the regulatory return is earned. in accordance with the principles of asc 980, we have recognized a regulatory deferral of certain amounts representing the timing difference between the profit earned from the jvs and the amount included in regulated rates to recover our approved investments in consolidated jvs. for additional information, refer to note 1, "nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies - s. noncontrolling interest," in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
pension and postretirement benefits. we have defined benefit plans for both pension and other postretirement benefits. the calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, health care trend rates, and mortality rates, among other assumptions. due to the size of the plans and the long-term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred into aoci or a regulatory balance sheet account, depending on the jurisdiction of our entity. these deferred gains or losses are then amortized into the income statement when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets (known in gaap as the "corridor" method) or when settlement accounting is triggered.
the discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, health care cost trend rates and mortality rates are critical assumptions. methods used to develop these assumptions are described below. while a third party actuarial firm assists with the development of many of these assumptions, we are ultimately responsible for selecting the final assumptions.
the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs. our discount rates for both pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using spot rates along an aa-rated above median yield curve with cash flows matching the expected duration of benefit payments to be made to plan participants.
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is a component utilized in calculating annual pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs. we estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, target asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. we also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets. for measurement of 2023 net periodic benefit cost, we selected a weighted-average assumption of the expected pre-tax long-term rate of return of 7.00% and 6.96% for our pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets, respectively. for measurement of 2024 net periodic benefit cost, we selected a weighted-average assumption of the expected pre-tax long-term rate of return of 7.02% and 7.06 % respectively, for our pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets.
we estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate, which is used in determining our other postretirement benefit net expense, based upon our actual health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted legislation, third-party actuarial surveys and general economic conditions.

we utilize a full yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. for further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefits, see note 16, "pension and other postemployment benefits," in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
typically, we use the society of actuaries' most recently published mortality data in developing a best estimate of mortality as part of the calculation of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. we adopted aon's u.s. endemic mortality improvement scale mp-2021, accounting for both the near-term and long-term covid-19 impacts.

goodwill and other intangible assets. we have six goodwill reporting units, comprised of the six state operating companies within the gas distribution operations reportable segment. our goodwill assets at december 31, 2023 were $1,486 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of columbia on november 1, 2000.
as required by gaap, we test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. our annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was performed on may 1, 2023. a qualitative ("step 0") test was completed on may 1, 2023, for all reporting units. in the step 0 analysis, we assessed various assumptions, events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the applicable reporting units as compared to the baseline "step 1" fair value measurement performed may 1, 2020. the results of this assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the reporting units substantially exceeded the related carrying values of our reporting units; therefore, no "step 1" analysis was required and no impairment charges were indicated. since the annual evaluation, there have been no indications that the fair values of the goodwill reporting units have decreased below the carrying values.
as noted above, application of the qualitative goodwill impairment test requires evaluating various events and circumstances to determine whether it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. although we believe all relevant factors were considered in the qualitative impairment analysis to reach the conclusion that goodwill is not impaired, significant changes in any one of the assumptions could potentially result in the recording of an impairment that could have significant impacts on the consolidated financial statements.

unbilled revenue. we record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. however, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. at the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. this unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon historical usage, customer rates and weather. as of december 31, 2023, we recorded $337.6 million of customer item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)

accounts receivable for unbilled revenue. significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. refer to note 3, "revenue recognition," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our significant judgments and estimates related to unbilled revenue recognition.
income taxes. the consolidated income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as any unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances, require use of estimates and significant management judgement. although we believe that current estimates for deferred tax assets and liabilities are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates for a variety of reasons, including reasonable projections of taxable income, the ability and intent to implement tax planning strategies if necessary, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. ultimate resolution or clarification of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows, and adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities could be material.
we account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach including a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. we evaluate each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. at december 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $21.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits. changes in these unrecognized tax benefits may result from remeasurement of amounts expected to be realized, settlements with tax authorities and expiration of statutes of limitations.
on a quarterly basis, we evaluate our deferred tax assets by considering current and historical financial results, expectations for future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or successfully implement tax planning strategies may affect the realization of deferred tax assets. we establish a valuation allowance when we conclude it is more likely than not that all, or a portion, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized in future periods. significant judgment is required to determine the amount of tax benefits expected to be realized. at december 31, 2023 and 2022, we had established $6.4 million and $7.8 million, respectively, of valuation allowances (net of federal benefit) related to certain state net operating loss carryforwards. refer to note 15, "income taxes," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.

item 1a.   risk factors our business involves various risks and uncertainties that may affect achievement of our business objectives. many of the risks could have ramifications across our organization. for example, while risks related to setting insurance rates and establishing and adjusting loss reserves are insurance activities, actual results differing from our assumptions, judgments or estimates in these areas could have an impact on our investment activities, growth and overall results.
the following discussion should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks we face. it is not a definitive summary of their potential impacts or of our strategies to manage and control the risks. please see item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, for a discussion of those strategies.
if any risks or uncertainties discussed here develop into actual events, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. in that case, the market price of our common stock could decline materially. the failure of our risk management strategies could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
readers should carefully consider this information together with the other information we have provided in this report and in other reports and materials we file periodically with the securities and exchange commission as well as news releases and other information we disseminate publicly.
risks related to insurance operations we rely primarily on independent insurance agents to distribute our products.
we market our main products, insurance policies for businesses and individuals, through independent, nonexclusive insurance agents. these agents are not obligated to promote our products and can and do sell our competitors' products. we must offer insurance products that meet the needs of these agents and their clients. we need to maintain good relationships with the agents who market our products. if we do not, these agents may market our competitors' products instead of ours, which may lead to us having a less desirable mix of business and could affect our results of operations.
in addition to our marketing of insurance policies for businesses and individuals, cincinnati re reinsures policies written by other insurance companies. this business is marketed through reinsurance intermediaries and is generally not offered by the typical independent agents who market our insurance policies.
certain events or conditions could diminish our agents' desire to produce business for us and the competitive advantage that our independent agents enjoy, including:
•downgrade of the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries. we believe our strong insurer financial strength ratings, in particular, the a+ (superior) ratings from a.m. best for our standard market property casualty insurance group and each subsidiary in that group, are an important competitive advantage. see item 1, our business and our strategy, financial strength, for additional discussion of our financial strength ratings.
•concerns that doing business with us is difficult or not profitable, perceptions that our level of service is no longer a distinguishing characteristic in the marketplace, perceptions that our products do not meet the needs of our agents' clients or perceptions that our business practices are not compatible with agents' business models.
•mergers and acquisitions of agencies could result in a concentration of a significant amount of premium in one agency.
•delays in the development, implementation, performance and benefits of technology systems and enhancements or independent agent perceptions that our technology solutions do not match their needs.
a reduction in the number of independent agencies marketing our products, the failure of agencies to successfully market our products or pay amounts due to us, changes in the strategy or operations of agencies or the choice of agencies to reduce their writings of our products could affect our results of operations if we are unable to replace them with agencies that produce adequate and profitable premiums.
cincinnati financial corporation - 2023 10-k - page 30
further, policyholders may choose a competitor's product rather than our own because of real or perceived differences in price, terms and conditions, coverage or service. if the quality of the independent agencies with which we do business were to decline, that also might cause policyholders to purchase their insurance through different agencies or channels. consumers, especially in the personal insurance industry segment, may increasingly choose to purchase insurance from distribution channels other than independent insurance agents, such as direct marketers. increased advertising by insurers, especially direct marketers, could cause consumers to shift their buying habits, bypassing independent agents altogether. innovation, new or changing technologies and/or buying trends or consumer preferences could reduce or eliminate the need or demand for products we sell.
marked or prolonged economic downturns or other events have in the past and may in the future result in a softening of the insurance market and agents or consumers choosing a competitor's product that may in turn adversely affect our premium revenues and underwriting profit. such economic events experienced during recent periods included elevated inflation, global supply chain disruptions, increasing interest rates, tightening credit markets and higher fuel costs.
our credit ratings or financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could be downgraded.
a downgrade in one or more of our company's credit or debt ratings could adversely impact our borrowing costs or limit our access to capital. financial strength ratings reflect a rating agency's opinion of our insurance subsidiaries' financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet obligations to policyholders. our ratings are subject to periodic review and there is no assurance that our ratings will not be changed. rating agencies could change or expand their requirements or could find that our insurance subsidiaries no longer meet the criteria established for current ratings. if our property casualty or life insurance subsidiary insurer financial strength ratings were to be downgraded, our agents might find it more difficult to market our products or might choose to emphasize the products of other carriers.
we could experience an unusually high level of losses due to natural or man-made catastrophe, terrorism or epidemic events or risk concentrations.
our insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes. catastrophes can be man-made or caused by natural perils. man-made catastrophes to which we have been exposed in the past, and may be exposed in the future, include, but are not limited to, industrial accidents, terrorist attacks, wars, cyberattacks, infrastructure failures, social unrest and riot. other man-made events, such as hydraulic fracturing, could cause damage from earth movement or create environmental and/or health hazards. natural peril catastrophe events to which we have been exposed in the past, and may be exposed in the future, include, but are not limited to, hurricanes, severe winter weather, wildfires, earthquakes, landslides and severe convective storm effects such as tornadoes, windstorms, hailstorms and flooding. due to the nature of these events, we are unable to predict precisely the frequency, severity or potential cost of catastrophe occurrences.
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured and reinsured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. our ability to appropriately manage catastrophe risk depends partially on catastrophe models, which may be affected by inaccurate or incomplete data, the uncertainty of the frequency and severity of future events and the uncertain impact of climate change. additionally, these models are recalibrated and changed over time, with more data availability and changing opinions regarding the effect of current or emerging loss patterns and conditions.
according to these models, probable maximum loss estimates from a single hurricane event that combine the effects of property casualty insurance written on a direct basis by the cincinnati insurance companies, the cincinnati re reinsurance portfolio and risks insured by cincinnati global include the following amounts, net of amounts recoverable through reinsurance ceded and also income taxes, and including the effects of estimated reinstatement premiums: $570 million for a once-in-a-100-year event and $848 million for a once-in-a-250-year event. please see item 7, liquidity and capital resources, 2024 reinsurance programs, for a discussion of modeled losses considered in evaluating our risk mitigation strategy, which includes our ceded reinsurance program.
cincinnati financial corporation - 2023 10-k - page 31
the geographic regions in which we market insurance and reinsurance are exposed to numerous natural catastrophes, such as:
•hurricanes in the gulf, eastern, southeastern and northeastern coastal regions
•earthquakes in many regions, most particularly in the new madrid fault zone, california, the northwest and southwest
•tornadoes, wind and hail
•wildfires
•winter storms
•on a worldwide basis, in the event of a severe catastrophic event or terrorist attack we may be exposed to material losses through our cincinnati re and cincinnati global operations.
the occurrence of terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve could result in substantially higher claims under our insurance policies than we have anticipated. our insurance policies provide coverage for terrorism risk in all areas we serve, including tier 1 and tier 2 cities. we have exposure to small co-op utilities, water utilities, wholesale fuel distributors, small shopping malls and small colleges throughout our 46 active states and, because of the number of associates located there, our fairfield, ohio, headquarters. additionally, our life insurance subsidiary could be adversely affected in the event of a terrorist event or an epidemic, particularly if the epidemic were to affect a broad range of the population, or affect the overall economy. our associate health plan is self-funded and could similarly be affected.
our results of operations would be adversely affected if the level of losses we experience over a period of time were to exceed our actuarially determined expectations. in addition, our financial condition may be adversely affected if we were required to sell securities prior to maturity or at unfavorable prices to pay an unusually high level of loss and loss expenses. securities pricing might be even less favorable if a number of insurance or other companies and other investors needed to sell securities during a short period of time because of unusually high losses from catastrophic events.
our geographic concentration links our performance to business, economic, environmental and regulatory conditions in certain states. we market our standard market property casualty insurance products in 46 states, but our business is concentrated in the midwest and southeast. we also have exposure in states where we do not actively market insurance when clients of our independent agencies have businesses or properties in multiple states or we provide insurance through cincinnati global and reinsurance through cincinnati re.
cincinnati re and cincinnati global provide reinsurance or insurance coverage in many parts of the world, including coverage for losses due to war, terrorism or political violence. wars can occur anywhere, and our results of operations could be adversely affected, especially if effects of wars expand over time and space. we have limited direct exposure within our insurance operations to businesses or individuals in russia, ukraine or gaza. we have exposure within our insurance operations, primarily through reinsurance treaties, to insured losses related to wars that include risks in the middle east region. if effects related to the war in gaza expand significantly in the middle east region, causing a high frequency of loss events, or a single extreme event, during the coverage period of our treaties or policies, our financial position and results of operations could be materially affected.
the cincinnati insurance company continues to expand its cincinnati re reinsurance assumed operations and has staffed it with seasoned underwriting and analytical associates who strive to assume risks that we understand, both quantitatively and qualitatively. business written includes treaties that provide coverage for property catastrophe and terrorism events on a worldwide basis. based on treaties in effect at january 1, 2024, the largest loss exposure to us for cincinnati re is from natural catastrophe events. that exposure includes probable maximum loss estimates, on a marginal basis, of the following amounts: $194 million for a once-in-a-100-year event and $224 million for a once-in-a-250-year event. those effects represent a single hurricane event and include the effects of income taxes, estimated reinstatement premiums and applicable reinsurance ceded, including any retrocessions for reinsurance assumed, and estimated reinstatement premiums. they are based on probable maximum loss estimates from the applied insurance research touchstone® version 10.0 catastrophe model. the marginal basis reflects diversification effects of the cincinnati re reinsurance portfolio and property casualty insurance written on a direct basis by the cincinnati insurance companies. ignoring diversification effects provided by those two components, on a standalone basis, probable maximum loss estimates for cincinnati re include the following amounts: $231 million for a once-in-a-100-year event and $281 million for a once-in-a-250-year event. if there is a cincinnati financial corporation - 2023 10-k - page 32
high frequency of large property catastrophe or terrorism events, or a single extreme event, during the coverage period of these treaties, our financial position and results of operations could be materially affected.
we are also expanding cincinnati global, our global specialty underwriter with premiums primarily for u.s. and international property exposures. cincinnati global also writes north american and united kingdom (u.k.) contingency and event cancellation coverage and worldwide credit and political risk coverage and political violence coverage. at january 1, 2024, the largest loss exposure to us for cincinnati global is from natural catastrophe events. cincinnati global's exposure from such events includes probable maximum loss estimates of the following amounts: $46 million for a once-in-a-100-year event and $64 million for a once-in-a-250-year event. those effects are on a standalone basis and represent a single hurricane event and include the effects of income taxes, applicable reinsurance ceded and estimated reinstatement premiums. they are based on probable maximum loss estimates from the applied insurance research touchstone version 10.0 catastrophe model. if there is a high frequency of large property catastrophe or terrorism events, or a single extreme event, during the coverage period of its policies, our financial position and results of operations could be materially affected.
additionally, the companies we invest in might be severely affected by a severe catastrophic event, terrorist attack, or epidemic event which could affect our financial condition and results of operations. our reinsurers might experience significant losses, potentially jeopardizing their ability to pay losses we cede to them. it could also reduce the availability of reinsurance. if we cannot obtain adequate reinsurance or primary insurance coverage at a reasonable cost, it could constrain where we can write business or reduce the amount of business we can write in certain areas. we also may be exposed to state guaranty fund assessments if other carriers in a state cannot meet their obligations to policyholders. a catastrophe or epidemic event also could affect our operations by damaging our headquarters facility, injuring associates and visitors at our fairfield, ohio, headquarters or disrupting our associates' ability to perform their assigned tasks.
climate change may adversely impact our results of operations and/or our financial position.
various scientists have linked global climate change from rising planet temperatures over the last several decades to a number of factors that contribute to the increased unpredictability, frequency, duration and severity of weather events, including: changing weather patterns, a rise in ocean temperatures and sea level rise. certain catastrophe models assume an increase in frequency and severity of certain weather or other events, which could result in a disproportionate impact on insurers with certain geographic concentrations of risk. changes in climate and/or weather patterns may increase the frequency and/or intensity of severe weather and natural catastrophe events, including hurricanes, heavy precipitation events, heavy wind events, flash flooding, sea level rise, droughts, heat waves and wildfires potentially leading to increased insured losses. a continuation of these trends would also likely increase the risks of writing property insurance in coastal areas or areas susceptible to wildfires or flooding, particularly in jurisdictions that restrict pricing and underwriting flexibility. we cannot predict how legal, regulatory or social responses to concerns about climate change may impact our business.
the outbreak of covid-19 could result in an unusually high level of losses.
in march 2020, the outbreak of covid-19, also known as the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2, was recognized as a pandemic by the world health organization. the outbreak was widespread in the u.s., including in the markets in which we operate. like many companies in the property casualty insurance industry, our property casualty subsidiaries were named as defendants in lawsuits seeking insurance coverage under commercial property insurance policies issued by the company for alleged losses resulting from the shutdown or suspension of their businesses due to the covid-19 pandemic. risks to our business include legislation or court decisions that extend business interruption insurance in commercial property coverage forms to cover claims for pure economic loss related to the covid-19 pandemic. legislative initiatives and pending litigation are ongoing in numerous jurisdictions, and we cannot provide assurance that we will not be impacted by adverse legislation or adverse judicial rulings in certain of these jurisdictions. these actions seek to extend coverage beyond the terms and conditions we intended for those policies, including policies that do not contain specific virus exclusions. therefore we could be forced to pay claims when no coverage was contemplated and for which no premium was collected. if these actions are successful, the aggregate amount of these claims could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition, reputation, results of operations and cash flows.
our net losses and loss adjustment expenses are estimates and actual net losses could be higher.
our estimates for covid-19 losses and loss adjustment expenses represent our best estimates as of december 31, 2023, based upon information currently available. these estimates are based on reported claims, policy level reviews, judicial rulings and other litigation developments. however, assumptions about coverage, cincinnati financial corporation - 2023 10-k - page 33
liability and reinsurance continue to be subject to on-going judicial review and may be subject to further government action. while we believe our net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses for covid-19 as of december 31, 2023, are adequate based on information available at this time, we continue to closely monitor reported claims, government actions, judicial decisions and changes in the levels of worldwide social disruption and economic activity arising from the pandemic and will adjust our estimates of gross and net losses as new information becomes available. factors that affect our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses or our ability to reasonably estimate such losses include the number of policyholders that will ultimately submit claims or file lawsuits; the lack of submitted proofs of loss for allegedly covered claims; judicial rulings in similar litigation involving other companies in the insurance industry; difference in state law and developing case law; litigation trends, including varying legal theories advanced by policyholders; whether and to what degree any class of policyholders may be certified; and the inherent unpredictability of litigation. such adjustments to our reserves for covid-19 losses and loss adjustment expenses may be material to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
our ability to properly underwrite and price risks and increased competition could adversely affect our results.
our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks. we establish our pricing based on assumptions about the level of losses that may occur within classes of business, geographic regions and other criteria.
to properly price our products, we must collect, properly analyze and use data to make decisions and take appropriate action; the data must be sufficient, reliable and accessible. cincinnati global has risks due to its reliance on coverholders in underwriting parts of its business. we also need to develop appropriate rating methodologies and formulae; and we may need to identify and respond to trends quickly. we may overestimate or underestimate loss cost trends or these trends may unexpectedly change, such as inflation in recent years outside of historical norms, leading to losing business by pricing risks above our competitors or charging rates too low to maintain profitability. legal trends in recent years have also made it more difficult to determine adequate pricing, including adverse changes in the tort environment caused by more aggressive attorney involvement in insurance claims, increased litigation, expanded theories of liability, higher jury awards, lawsuit abuse and third-party litigation finance. if rates are not accurate, we may not generate enough premiums to offset losses and expenses, or we may not be competitive in the marketplace.
our ability to set appropriate rates are hampered if states where we write business refuse to allow rate increases that we believe are necessary to cover the risks insured. a state could also hamper our ability to set appropriate rates if it no longer allows us to use factors that we believe are predictive of loss, such as credit-based factors. limitations on our ability to use various types of artificial intelligence (ai) in the development of pricing precision could adversely affect underwriting results. multiple states require us to purchase reinsurance from a mandatory reinsurance fund. such reinsurance funds can create a credit risk for insurers if not adequately funded by the state and, in some cases, the existence of a reinsurance fund could affect the prices charged for our policies. the effect of these and similar arrangements could reduce our profitability in any given period or limit our ability to grow our business.
the insurance industry is cyclical and intensely competitive. from time to time, the industry goes through prolonged periods of intense competition during which it is more difficult to attract new business, retain existing business and maintain profitability. competition in our insurance business is based on many factors, including:
•competitiveness of premiums charged
•relationships among carriers, agents, brokers and policyholders
•underwriting and pricing methodologies that allow insurers to identify and appropriately price risks
•compensation provided to agents
•underwriting discipline
•terms and conditions of insurance coverage
•speed with which products are brought to market
•product and marketing innovations, including advertising
•technological competence and innovation
•ability to control expenses
•adequacy of financial strength ratings by independent rating agencies such as a.m. best cincinnati financial corporation - 2023 10-k - page 34
•quality of services and tools provided to agents and policyholders
•claims satisfaction and reputation we compete with major u.s., bermudian, european, and other international insurers and reinsurers and with underwriting syndicates, some of which have greater financial, marketing and management resources than we do. recent industry consolidation, including business combinations among insurance and other financial services companies, has resulted in larger competitors with even greater financial resources. we also compete with new companies that continue to enter the insurance and reinsurance markets. in addition, capital market participants have created alternative products that are intended to compete with reinsurance products that we sell through cincinnati re. increased competition could result in fewer submissions, lower premium rates, and less favorable policy terms and conditions, which could reduce our underwriting margins and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
if our pricing was incorrect or we were unable to compete effectively because of one or more of these factors, our premium writings could decline and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. large competitors could intentionally disrupt the market by targeting certain lines or underpricing the market.
please see the discussion of our commercial lines, personal lines, excess and surplus lines and life insurance segments in item 1, our segments, for a discussion of our competitive position in the insurance marketplace.
our pricing and capital models could be flawed.
we use various actuarial pricing methods, predictive pricing and underwriting models, stochastic models and/or forecasting techniques to help us understand our business, analyze risk and estimate future trends. the output of these techniques and models is used to assist us in making underwriting, pricing, reinsurance, reserving and capital decisions and helps us set our strategic direction. these models contain numerous assumptions, including the assumption that the data used is sufficient and accurate. they are also subject to uncertainties and limitations inherent in any statistical analysis. actual results may be materially different from modeled output, resulting in pricing our products incorrectly, overestimating or underestimating reserves, or inaccurately forecasting the impact of modeled events on our results. this could materially adversely impact the results of our operations.
our loss reserves, our largest liability, are based on estimates and could be inadequate to cover our actual losses.
our consolidated financial statements are prepared using gaap. these principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. actual results could differ materially from those estimates. for a discussion of the significant accounting policies we use to prepare our financial statements, the material implications of uncertainties associated with the methods, assumptions and estimates underlying our critical accounting policies and the process used to determine our loss reserves, please refer to item 8, note 1 of the consolidated financial statements, and item 7, critical accounting estimates, property casualty insurance loss and loss expense reserves and life insurance policy reserves.
our most critical accounting estimate is loss reserves. loss reserves are the amounts we expect to pay for covered claims and expenses we incur to settle those claims. the loss reserves we establish in our financial statements represent an estimate of amounts needed to pay and administer claims arising from insured events that have already occurred, including events that have not yet been reported to us. loss reserves are estimates and are inherently uncertain; they do not and cannot represent an exact measure of liability. inflationary scenarios, especially scenarios outside of historical norms or regulatory changes that affect the assumptions underlying our critical accounting estimates, may make it more difficult to estimate loss reserves. examples of inflation effects include adverse changes in the tort environment caused by more aggressive attorney involvement in insurance claims, increased litigation, expanded theories of liability, higher jury awards, lawsuit abuse and third-party litigation finance. accordingly, our loss reserves for past periods could prove to be inadequate to cover our actual losses and related expenses. any changes in these estimates are reflected in our results of operations during the period in which the changes are made. an increase in our loss reserves would decrease earnings, while a decrease in our loss reserves would increase earnings.
unforeseen losses, or unintended coverages, the type and magnitude of which we cannot predict, may emerge. these additional losses could arise from changes in the legal environment, laws and regulations, climate change, catastrophic events, increases in loss severity or frequency, environmental claims, mass torts or other causes such cincinnati financial corporation - 2023 10-k - page 35
as social inflation. such future losses could be substantial. the increase in inflation in recent periods has significantly increased our loss costs in our auto and property businesses. it is possible that inflation could remain at high levels for a prolonged period, or increase from these high levels, which could in turn lead to further increases in our loss costs. in addition, a significant portion of claims costs consists of medical costs. as a result, an increase in medical inflation could materially and adversely impact our loss costs and our loss reserves. recent changes in the macroeconomic environment have impacted medical labor and materials costs, the potential persistency of which could result in future loss costs which are higher than our current expectations.
our life policy reserves are also subject to uncertainty. periods of higher death claims outside of long-term historical norms, such as during the covid-19 pandemic, and not anticipated within our actuarial models could make our life policy reserves inadequate to cover actual future death claims. increases in estimates of future death claims would increase life policy reserve levels and in turn decrease earnings.
in addition to the risks stated above, cincinnati re reserves are subject to uncertainty because a reinsurer relies on the original underwriting decisions and claims reserving practices of ceding companies. as a result, we are subject to the risk that our ceding companies may not have adequately evaluated the risks reinsured by us and the premiums ceded may not adequately compensate us for the risks we assume. in addition, there is generally a longer lapse of time from the occurrence of the event to the reporting of the loss or benefit to the reinsurer and ultimate resolution or settlement of the loss. similar risks exist for cincinnati global due to potential delays in loss reporting.
because of the inherent uncertainties involved in setting reserves, we cannot provide assurance that our existing reserves or future reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events. our results of operations and financial condition have in the past been, and in the future could be, materially affected by adverse loss development for events that we insured in prior periods.
international operations subject us to additional regulation and expose us to additional investment, political and economic risks.
we have international operations that expose us to a number of additional risks. these risks include restrictions such as price controls, capital controls, currency exchange limits, ownership limits and other restrictive or anti-competitive governmental actions or requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. our business activities outside the u.s., including in the u.k., subject us to political and economic risks, including foreign currency and credit risk. additionally, cincinnati global's operations will expand the products offered by us and could expose us to additional regulation or other risks.
business activities outside the u.s. will subject us to additional domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including the foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act and similar laws in other countries that prohibit the making of improper payments to foreign officials. in addition, insurers in the u.k. (including managing agents and members of lloyd's of london) are subject to solvency ii and the u.k. regulatory regime, which itself includes rules promulgated by lloyd's. although we have policies and controls in place that are designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulatory requirements, if those controls are ineffective and an employee or intermediary fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties and our business and reputation could be adversely affected. some countries have laws and regulations that lack clarity and, even with local expertise and effective controls, it can be difficult to determine the exact requirements of, and potential liability under, the local laws. failure to comply with local laws in a particular market may result in substantial liability and could have a significant and negative effect not only on our business in that market but also on our reputation generally.
business activities at cincinnati global are subject to lloyd's approval of a business plan each year. there is risk that cincinnati global's plan will not be approved or will be limited. as a lloyd's managing agent and syndicate, cincinnati global is exposed to various risks and their associated uncertainties, including lloyd's rating agency ratings, reputation, and cincinnati global's obligation to maintain funds at lloyd's to support its underwriting activities and periodic assessment of its capital, governance and other aspects of its business.
developments relating to the united kingdom leaving the european union could adversely affect cincinnati global's operations.
the terms of the u.k.'s withdrawal from the european union (brexit) and the relationship between the u.k. and the european union going forward can affect economic conditions, including the terms of trade between them. the ultimate impact of brexit is uncertain and will depend on any agreements that the u.k. makes to retain access to cincinnati financial corporation - 2023 10-k - page 36
european union markets. brexit could also lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the u.k. determines which european union laws to replace or replicate. these or other adverse consequences from brexit could adversely affect the operations and business opportunities of cincinnati global.
with a view to mitigating the potential effects of brexit on business underwritten through it, lloyd's has set up an insurance company subsidiary in belgium, lloyd's europe, underwriting european economic area insurance business via that subsidiary.
our ability to obtain or collect on our reinsurance protection could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
we buy property casualty and life reinsurance coverage to mitigate the liquidity risk and earnings volatility risk of an unexpected rise in claims severity or frequency from catastrophic events or a single large loss. the availability, amount and cost of reinsurance depend on market conditions and may vary significantly. if we were unable to obtain reinsurance on acceptable terms and in appropriate amounts, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.
in addition, we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. although we purchase reinsurance to manage our risks and exposures to losses, this reinsurance does not discharge our direct obligations under the policies we write. we would remain liable to our policyholders even if we were unable to recover what we believe we are entitled to receive under our reinsurance contracts. reinsurers might refuse or fail to pay losses that we cede to them, or they might delay payment. for long-tail claims, the creditworthiness of our reinsurers may change before we can recover amounts to which we are entitled. a reinsurer's insolvency, inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement with our insurance subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
please see item 7, liquidity and capital resources, 2024 reinsurance ceded programs, for a discussion of selected reinsurance transactions.
risks related to investments or other financial matters financial disruption or a prolonged economic downturn could materially and adversely affect our investment performance.
recent events, including the global supply chain disruptions, increasing interest rate environment and inflationary pressures, have contributed to significant disruption and volatility for financial markets and decreased economic activity. many companies experienced uncertainty and reduced liquidity. in the event that these conditions continue, recur or result in a prolonged economic downturn or recession, they could further adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. such adverse impacts may be material. these market conditions have in the past, and could in the future, cause our investment income or the value of securities we own to decrease.
our ability to achieve our performance objectives could be affected by changes in the financial, credit and capital markets or the general economy.
we invest premiums received from policyholders and other available cash to generate investment income and capital appreciation, while also maintaining sufficient liquidity to pay covered claims and operating expenses, service our debt obligations and pay dividends. the value of our invested assets is an important component of shareholders' equity, also known as book value. changes in the valuation of invested assets can significantly affect changes in book value per share, a key performance objective as discussed in item 7, executive summary of management's discussion and analysis.
for fixed-maturity investments such as bonds, which represented 55.7% of the fair value of our investment portfolio at the end of 2023, the inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices leads to falling bond values during periods of increasing interest rates. significant increases in the general level of interest rates, such as we experienced during recent periods, have an adverse effect on our shareholders' equity.
investment income is an important component of our revenues and net income. the ability to increase investment income and generate longer-term growth in book value is affected by factors beyond our control, such as: inflation, economic growth, interest rates, world political conditions, changes in laws and regulations, future actions or cincinnati financial corporation - 2023 10-k - page 37
inactions of the u.s. government, epidemic events, terrorism attacks or threats, war, adverse events affecting other companies in our industry or the industries in which we invest, market events leading to credit constriction, and other widespread unpredictable events. these events have in the past and may in the future adversely affect the economy generally and cause our investment income or the value of securities we own to decrease. wars can occur anywhere in the world and have an adverse effect on our investment portfolio, especially if effects of wars expand over time and space. we do not have material exposure to investments based in russia, ukraine, israel or gaza. if there is significant expansion of wars to regions beyond these countries, it may have an adverse effect. any significant decline in our investment income will have an adverse effect on our net income, and thereby on our shareholders' equity and our statutory capital and surplus. for a more detailed discussion of risks associated with our investments, please refer to item 7a, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
we have issued universal life contracts with guaranteed minimum returns, referred to as bank-owned life insurance contracts (bolis). a boli is designed with the bank as the policy owner and the policy beneficiary. we legally segregate and record as separate accounts the assets and liabilities for certain bolis, when required by the specific contract provisions. minimum investment returns, account values and death benefits are guaranteed by us for our separate account bolis. we could incur losses in the performance of these guarantees.
we also have life policy reserves established for traditional life policies including term, whole and other products. reserve variability will increase with the adoption of asu 2018-12 as discussed in item 8, note 1 of the consolidated financial statements, as reserves are based on certain cash flow assumptions as well as a discount rate assumption. this discount rate assumption is based on updated market value discount rates. life policy reserves are required to be recorded using an updated discount rate assumption quarterly. remeasurement adjustments are now required to be remeasured for the updated discount rate and are recorded as an increase or decrease to life policy reserves with an offsetting increase or decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci). as the discount rate increases during the quarter, life policy reserves decrease and aoci increases. conversely, as the discount rate decreases during the quarter, life policy reserves increase and aoci decreases. a significant decrease in discount rates, relative to the prior quarter, would have an adverse effect on shareholders' equity.
our investment performance also could suffer because of the types of investments, industry groups and/or individual securities in which we choose to invest. market value changes related to these choices could cause a material change in our financial condition or results of operations.
at year-end 2023, common stock holdings made up 42.9% of our investment portfolio. adverse news or events affecting the global or u.s. economy or the equity markets, such as we experienced during recent years, will affect our net income, book value and overall results, and could affect our ability to pay our common stock dividend. see item 7, investments results, and item 7a, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, for a discussion of our investment activities.
deterioration in the banking sector or in banks with which we have relationships could affect our results of operations. our ability to maintain or obtain short-term lines of credit could be affected if the banks from which we obtain these lines are acquired, fail or are otherwise negatively affected. we may lose premium revenue if a bank that owns appointed agencies were to change its strategies. we could experience increased losses in our director and officer liability line of business if claims were made against insured financial institutions.
a deterioration of credit and market conditions could also impair our ability to access credit markets and could affect existing or future lending arrangements.
our overall results are affected if a significant portion of our commercial lines or personal lines policyholders are adversely affected by marked or prolonged economic downturns and events such as a downturn in construction and related sectors, tightening credit markets and higher fuel costs experienced during recent periods. such events make it more difficult for policyholders to finance new projects, complete projects or expand their businesses, and can lead to lower premiums from reduced payrolls and sales and lower purchases of equipment and vehicles. these events could also cause claims, including surety claims, to increase due to a policyholder's inability to secure necessary financing to complete projects or to collect on underlying lines of credit in the claims process. such economic downturns and events have a greater impact in the construction sector where we have a concentration of risks and in geographic areas that are hardest hit by economic downturns.

deteriorating economic conditions could also increase the degree of credit risk associated with amounts due from independent agents who collect premiums for payment to us and could hamper our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers.
our status as an insurance holding company with no direct operations could affect our ability to pay dividends in the future.
cincinnati financial corporation is a holding company that transacts substantially all of its business through its subsidiaries. our primary assets are the stock in our operating subsidiaries and our investments. consequently, our cash flow to pay cash dividends and interest on our long-term debt depends on dividends we receive from our operating subsidiaries and income earned on investments held at the parent-company level.
dividends received from our lead insurance subsidiary are restricted by the insurance laws of ohio, its domiciliary state. these laws establish minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds and limits. in 2024, the maximum dividend that may be paid without prior regulatory approval is limited to the greater of 10% of statutory capital and surplus or 100% of statutory net income for the prior calendar year, up to the amount of statutory unassigned capital and surplus as of the end of the prior calendar year. dividends exceeding these limitations may be paid only with prior approval of the ohio department of insurance. we might not be able to receive dividends from our insurance subsidiaries, or we might not receive dividends in the amounts necessary to meet our debt obligations or to pay dividends on our common stock without liquidating securities. this could affect our financial position.
please see item 1, regulation, and item 8, note 9 of the consolidated financial statements, for a discussion of insurance holding company dividend regulations.
general risk factors elevated inflation negatively impacts profit and the value of investments.
inflation in various forms, such as we experienced in recent periods, reduces underwriting profitability due to higher losses and loss expenses to repair damaged autos or other property that we insure. elevated inflation can also be in the form of social inflation of litigation costs, jury awards and settlement expectations. in addition to adverse effects on the fair value of our equity portfolio, inflationary pressures can also cause or contribute to, or are the result of, increases in interest rates, which reduces the fair value of our fixed-maturity portfolio.
our business depends on the uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems and business functions.
our business depends on our associates' ability to perform necessary business functions, such as processing new and renewal policies and handling claims. we increasingly rely on technology and systems to accomplish these business functions in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion. our inability to access our headquarters facilities for certain critical functions or a failure of technology, telecommunications or other systems or the loss or failure of services provided by key vendors, could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis or affect the accuracy of transactions. if sustained or repeated, such a business interruption or system failure could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, serve our agents and policyholders, pay claims in a timely manner, collect receivables or perform other necessary business functions. if our disaster recovery and business continuity plans did not sufficiently consider, address or reverse the circumstances of an interruption or failure, this could result in a materially adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
our ability to successfully execute business functions also depends on hiring and retaining the qualified associates we employ. competition for high-quality executives and other key associates occurs within the insurance industry and from other industries. we also must effectively develop and manage associates, including providing training and resources. such tools and information can allow them to effectively perform critical business functions and adapt to changing business needs. during some periods, such as we experienced in recent years, labor markets are tight and there is intense competition for associates qualified to execute important business functions. many markets in which we operate are experiencing a low unemployment rate and labor shortages are affecting many industries. if we are unable to attract and retain certain associates, or if we fail to provide adequate training or resources, or fail to provide a work environment that is attractive to associates, we could limit the success of executing our strategic plans and vital business functions.
cincinnati financial corporation - 2023 10-k - page 39
the effects of changes in industry practices, laws and regulations on our business are uncertain.
as industry practices and legal, judicial, legislative, regulatory, political, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to insurance pricing, claims and coverage emerge. there has been increased regulatory scrutiny of the use of machine learning and ai, and it is likely that we will be subject to new regulations that could materially adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions. these issues, and others, may adversely affect our business by impeding our ability to obtain adequate rates for covered risks or otherwise extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent, by increasing the number or size of claims, by varying assumptions underlying our critical accounting estimates or by increasing duties owed to policyholders beyond contractual obligations. in some instances, unforeseeable emerging and latent claim and coverage issues and court decisions or legislative changes may not become apparent until sometime after we have issued the insurance policies that could be affected by the changes. as a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a policy is issued and our pricing and reserve estimates may not accurately reflect its effect.
some of our existing or potential shareholders, policyholders, associates, regulators, and other stakeholders will evaluate our business practices according to a variety of environmental, social and governance (esg) standards and expectations, including those related to climate change, inclusive diversity and equity, data privacy, and the well-being of our employees. our business practices and disclosures are evaluated against esg standards which are continually evolving and not always well defined or readily measurable today. our practices may not change in the particular ways or at the rate stakeholders expect, leading to business or reputational challenges.
we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative organizations, including the financial accounting standards board (fasb) and the sec. future changes required to be adopted could change the current accounting treatment that we apply and could result in material adverse effects on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
our investment income benefits from tax rate preferences for municipal bond interest and dividend income from equity securities. market valuations for these securities also benefit from the tax-preference aspect of current tax laws, affecting the value of our investment portfolio and also shareholders' equity. future changes in tax laws, or other changes such as regulations for applicability of alternative minimum taxes, could result in material adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition.
the naic, state insurance regulators and state legislators continually re-examine existing laws and regulations governing insurance companies and insurance holding companies, specifically focusing on modifications to statutory accounting principles, interpretations of existing laws, regulations relating to product forms and pricing methodologies and the development of new laws and regulations that affect a variety of financial and nonfinancial components of our business. any proposed or future legislation, regulation or naic initiatives, if adopted, may be more restrictive on our ability to conduct business than current regulatory requirements or may result in higher costs. the loss or significant restriction on the use of a particular variable, such as credit, in pricing and underwriting our products could lead to future unprofitability and increased costs.
federal laws and regulations and the influence of international laws and regulations, including those that may be enacted in the wake of the financial and credit crises, may have adverse effects on our business, potentially including a change from a state-based system of regulation to a system of federal regulation, the repeal of the mccarran ferguson act, and/or measures under the dodd-frank act that establish the federal insurance office and provide for a determination that a nonbank financial company presents systemic risk and therefore should be subject to heightened supervision by the federal reserve board. it is not known how this federal office will coordinate and interact with the naic and state insurance regulators. adoption or implementation of any of these measures may restrict our ability to conduct our insurance business, govern our corporate affairs or increase our cost of doing business.
in addition, global climate change and global climate change transitions may continue to lead to new or enhanced regulation, which may be difficult or costly to comply with, or impact assets that we invest in, which may result in realized and unrealized losses in future periods that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and/or financial position. it is not possible to foresee the impacts of potential future climate regulation, or which, if any, assets, industries or markets may be materially and adversely affected by global climate change and global climate change transitions, nor is it possible to foresee the magnitude of such effects.
cincinnati financial corporation - 2023 10-k - page 40
the effects of such changes could adversely affect our results of operations. please see item 7, critical accounting estimates, property casualty insurance loss and loss expense reserves and life insurance policy reserves, for a discussion of our reserving practices.
managing technology initiatives and meeting data security requirements are significant challenges.
we use technology to process, store, retrieve, evaluate and use customer and company data and information. our information technology and telecommunications systems, in turn, interface with and rely upon third-party systems. we must be able to access our systems to provide insurance quotes, process premium payments, make changes to existing policies, file and pay claims, provide customer support, manage our investment portfolios, report on financial results and perform other necessary business functions. systems failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform these business functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers. in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, a pandemic, civil unrest, an industrial accident, a cyberattack, a blackout, a terrorist attack (including conventional, nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological) or war, systems upon which we rely may be inaccessible to our associates or independent agents for an extended period of time. even if our associates and independent agents are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems used to conduct our business are disabled or destroyed. while technology can streamline many business processes and ultimately reduce the costs of operations, technology initiatives present short-term cost and also have implementation and operational risks. in addition, we may have inaccurate expense projections, implementation schedules or expectations regarding the effectiveness and user acceptance of the end product. these issues could escalate over time. if we were unable to find and retain associates with key technical knowledge, our ability to develop and deploy key technology solutions could be hampered.
our systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to viruses or other malicious code, unauthorized access, cyberattacks, cyber frauds or other computer-related penetrations. increasing sophistication of cyber criminals and terrorists make keeping up with new threats difficult and could result in a breach. patching and other measures to protect existing systems and servers could be inadequate, especially on systems that are being retired. controls employed by our u.s., off-shore and cloud vendors could prove inadequate. we could also experience a breach by intentional or negligent conduct on the part of associates or other internal sources. our systems and those of our third-party vendors may become vulnerable to damage or disruption due to circumstances beyond our or their control, such as from catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, network failures, and viruses, ransomware and malware.
a breach of our security or the security of a vendor that results in unauthorized access to our data could expose us to a disruption or challenges relating to our daily operations as well as to data loss, litigation, damages, fines and penalties, significant increases in compliance costs and reputational damage. from time to time we have had to, and in the future we may need to, increase or expend resources to investigate or remediate vulnerabilities as a result of data security incidents. such resources are costly in time and expense, and detract from resources spent on or are otherwise devoted to our core operations. in addition, depending on the nature of an incident, we may not be able to detect an incident readily, assess its severity or impact, or appropriately respond in a timely manner, which could increase our risk and exposures.
please see item 1c, cybersecurity, for further discussion of our cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance.
cincinnati financial corporation - 2023 10-k - page 41
any failure to protect the confidentiality of customer information could adversely affect our reputation or expose us to fines, penalties or litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we necessarily collect, use and hold data concerning individuals and businesses with whom we have a relationship. we are required to safeguard the confidential personal information of our customers and applicants. we are subject to an increasing number of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security, as well as contractual commitments. these laws and regulations are rapidly evolving, complex, vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and sometimes conflict. in the absence of updated, uniform federal privacy legislation, there is a growing trend in the states in which we operate, to adopt comprehensive privacy legislation that provides consumers with various privacy rights and imposes significant compliance burdens on covered companies. failure to comply with data security or privacy laws or regulations could subject us to regulatory enforcement actions and fines, penalties, litigation, private rights of action or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others if confidential customer information is misappropriated from our computer systems, those of our vendors, our independent agents or others with whom we do business, or otherwise. despite the security measures that may be in place, any such systems may be vulnerable to the types of attacks and security incidents described above. any well-publicized compromise of security could deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information, impart reputational or other harm, and/or have a material adverse effect on our business. additionally, privacy legislation may make our business partners more reluctant to share information with us that is useful in conducting our business.

item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the purpose of management's discussion and analysis is to provide an understanding of cincinnati financial corporation's consolidated results of operations and financial condition. our management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item 8, consolidated financial statements and related notes. we present per share data on a diluted basis unless otherwise noted, adjusting those amounts for all stock splits and stock dividends.
we begin with an executive summary of our results of operations, followed by other highlights and details about critical accounting estimates. in several instances, we refer to estimated industry data so that we can provide information on our performance within the context of the overall insurance industry. unless otherwise noted, the industry data is prepared by a.m. best, a leading insurance industry statistical, analytical and financial strength rating organization. information from a.m. best is presented on a statutory accounting basis for insurance company regulation in the united states of america. when we provide our results on a comparable statutory accounting basis, we label it as such; all other company data is presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (gaap).
as discussed in item 8, note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, effective january 1, 2023, we adopted asu 2018-12, financial services - insurance (topic 944): targeted improvements to the accounting for long-duration contracts. we adjusted applicable financial statements. related financial data shown in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations also have been adjusted.
through the cincinnati insurance company, cincinnati financial corporation is one of the 25 largest property casualty insurers in the nation, based on net written premium volume for the first nine months of 2023, among approximately 2,000 u.s. stock and mutual insurer groups. we market our insurance products through a select group of independent insurance agencies in 46 states as discussed in item 1, our business and our strategy.
the u.s. economy, the insurance industry and our company continue to face many challenges. our long-term perspective has allowed us to address immediate challenges while also focusing on the major decisions that best position the company for success through all market cycles. we believe that this forward-looking view consistently benefits our shareholders, agents, policyholders and associates.
to measure our progress, we have defined a measure of value creation that we believe captures the contribution of our insurance operations, the success of our investment strategy and the importance we place on paying cash dividends to shareholders. we refer to this measure as our value creation ratio (vcr) and it is made up of two primary components: (1) our rate of growth in book value per share plus (2) the ratio of dividends declared per share to beginning book value per share. this measure, intended to be all-inclusive regarding changes in book value per share, uses originally reported book value per share in cases where book value per share has been adjusted, such as after the adoption of accounting standards updates with a cumulative effect of a change in accounting.
the primary sources of our company's net income are summarized below. we discuss contributions to net income and vcr by source in corporate financial highlights, followed by more detailed discussion in financial results.
•underwriting profit (loss) - includes revenues from earned premiums for insurance and reinsurance policies or contracts, reduced by losses and loss expenses from associated insurance coverages. those revenues are further reduced by underwriting expenses associated with marketing policies or related to administration of our insurance operations. the net result represents an underwriting profit when revenues exceed losses and expenses.
•investment income - is generated primarily from investing the premiums collected for insurance policies sold, until funds are needed to pay losses for insurance claims or other expenses. interest income from bonds or dividend income from stocks are the main categories of our investment income, with additional contribution from compounding effects over time.
cincinnati financial corporation - 2023 10-k - page 47
•investment gains and losses - occur from appreciation or depreciation of invested assets over time. gains or losses are generally recognized from changes in market values of equity securities without a sale or when invested assets are sold or become impaired.
executive summary our value creation ratio, defined above, is our primary performance target. vcr trends are shown in the table below.

we are targeting an annual value creation ratio averaging 10% to 13% over the next five-year period. at 19.5% for 2023, our performance was above the high end of that range. it was within the range for the three-year period and above the high end of the range for the five-year period, both that ended in december 2023.
the table below shows the primary contributors of our value creation ratio on a percentage basis. analysis of the contributors aids understanding of our financial performance. our financial results are further analyzed in the corporate financial highlights section below.

the 2023 value creation ratio improved by 34.1 percentage points, compared with 2022, and again included a significant contribution from operating results, as shown in the table above, that was 3.9 percentage-points higher than last year. the 2023 ratio improvement was primarily due to a higher valuation for our investment portfolio, with increases of 17.9 percentage-points from our equity securities investment portfolio and 12.0 points from our fixed-maturity securities investment portfolio. the decrease in 2022, compared with 2021, was primarily due to a reduction in overall net gains from our investment portfolio.

*** dividend declared to shareholders divided by beginning of year book value when looking at our longer-term objectives, we see three primary performance drivers for our value creation ratio:
•premium growth - we believe over any five-year period our agency relationships and initiatives can lead to a property casualty written premium growth rate that exceeds the industry average. the compound annual growth rate of our net written premiums was 9.9% over the five-year period 2019 through 2023, exceeding the 6.9% estimated growth rate for the property casualty insurance industry, with 2023 representing industry data reported through the first nine months of 2023. the industry's growth rate excludes its mortgage and financial guaranty lines of business.
•combined ratio - we believe our underwriting philosophy and initiatives can drive performance to achieve our underwriting profitability target of a gaap combined ratio over any five-year period that consistently averages within the range of 92% to 98% in the future, better than our target of 95% to 100% during 2012 through 2023. we changed the target because we believe we can continue to perform at a high level. our gaap combined ratio averaged 94.6% over the five-year period 2019 through 2023, slightly better than the performance target range for that period. performance as measured by the combined ratio is discussed in consolidated property casualty insurance results. our statutory combined ratio averaged 94.1% over the five-year period 2019 through 2023, compared with an estimated 101.1% for the property casualty industry, with 2023 representing industry data reported through the first nine months of 2023. the industry's ratio again excludes its mortgage and financial guaranty lines of business.
•investment contribution - we believe our investment philosophy and initiatives can drive investment income growth and lead to a total return on our equity investment portfolio over a five-year period that exceeds the five-year total return of the s&p 500 index.
◦investment income growth, on a pretax basis, had a compound annual growth rate of 7.6% over the five-year period 2019 through 2023.
◦over the five years ended december 31, 2023, our equity portfolio compound annual total return was 15.0% compared with a compound annual total return of 15.7% for the index. our equity portfolio favors larger-capitalization, high-quality, dividend-growing stocks with a slight value orientation. for the year 2023, our equity portfolio total return was 15.2%, compared with 26.3% for the index.

the board of directors is committed to rewarding shareholders directly through cash dividends and share repurchase authorizations. through 2023, the company has increased the annual cash dividend rate for 63 consecutive years, a record we believe is matched by only seven other publicly traded u.s. companies. in addition to regular dividends, strong capital and excellent company performance has provided opportunities to further reward shareholders. the board regularly evaluates relevant factors in dividend-related decisions, and the 2023 increase to the regular dividend reflected confidence in our outstanding capital, liquidity and financial flexibility, as well as progress of our initiatives to improve earnings performance while growing insurance premium revenues. we discuss our financial position in more detail in liquidity and capital resources.
our view of the shareholder value we can create over the next five years relies largely on three assumptions - each highly dependent on the external environment. first, we anticipate our property casualty average insurance prices will increase in proportion to, or in excess of, our loss cost trends. second, we assume that the economy can maintain a long-term growth track. third, we assume that valuations of our marketable securities will vary within a typical range over time, based on historical trends. if those assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may not be able to achieve our performance targets even if we accomplish our strategic objectives.
we discuss in item 1a, risk factors, many potential risks to our business and our ability to achieve our qualitative and quantitative objectives.

total investments increased by 13% during 2023 on a fair value basis, and included an increase in our securities portfolio valuation that added to an 8% increase in its cost basis. entering 2024, we believe the portfolio continues to be well diversified and is well positioned to withstand short-term fluctuations. we discuss our investment strategy in item 1, investments segment, and results for the segment in investments results. total assets increased by 10%, compared with year-end 2022. shareholders' equity increased by 15% and book value per share also increased by 15%, for reasons discussed in the preceding executive summary.
the amount of our debt obligations decreased by $24 million in 2023, compared with 2022. our 6.3% ratio of debt to total capital (debt plus shareholders' equity) at year-end 2023 decreased by 1.1 percentage points compared with the prior-year ratio.

net income rose by $2.330 billion in 2023, compared with net a net loss for 2022, including a $2.050 billion increase in net investment gains on an after-tax basis. the improved 2023 net income also included an increase in property casualty underwriting income of $206 million after taxes, as discussed below, and a $91 million increase in investment income after taxes. our investment operation's performance is discussed further in investments results. a net loss of $487 million in 2022, representing a $3.455 billion decrease compared with net income for 2021, included a $3.062 billion reduction in net investment gains after taxes. the reduced 2022 net income also included a decrease in property casualty underwriting income of $467 million after taxes and a $55 million increase in investment income after taxes.
during 2021 through 2023, sars-cov-2, also known as covid-19 and recognized as a pandemic by the world health organization, continued to cause various effects in parts of the world. we believe it did not have a significant effect on our premium or investment revenues during 2023, 2022 or 2021. for future periods, renewal premium or new business premium amounts could decline due to reduced spending by businesses or consumers, cincinnati financial corporation - 2023 10-k - page 51
or if the basis for policy premiums, such as sales and payrolls of businesses we insure, decrease as a result of a weakening economy, pandemic or other reasons. premium growth by segment is discussed below in financial results.
during 2023, 2022 and 2021, there were no material changes to our estimates for incurred losses and expenses related to the pandemic. factors used in estimating reserves for business interruption legal expenses related to the pandemic included estimates for attorney fees associated with the defense of such lawsuits filed against the company; litigation trends of such cases, including responding to amended and replead cases and cases on appeal; and trends in judicial decisions in cases filed against the company and other insurers. loss experience for our insurance operations is influenced by many factors, as discussed in critical accounting estimates, property casualty insurance loss and loss expense reserves. because of various factors that affect exposure to certain insurance losses, such as less miles driven for vehicles or reduced sales and payrolls for businesses, there could be a reduction in future losses, and in some cases a generally corresponding reduction in premiums. also, there could be losses or legal expenses that increase or otherwise occur independently of changes in the economy or changes in sales or payrolls of businesses we insure, due to inflation, pandemic effects or other factors.

property casualty net written premiums grew 10% and earned premiums also grew 10% in 2023. the growth reflected average renewal price increases, premium growth initiatives and a higher level of insured exposures, including a contribution to net written premium growth of less than 1 percentage point from cincinnati re and cincinnati global in total. growth in 2022 net written premiums and earned premiums was driven by factors similar to 2023. trends and related factors are discussed in commercial lines, personal lines and excess and surplus lines insurance results.
our property casualty insurance operations generated an underwriting profit for each of the three years ending in 2023. underwriting results improved in 2023, compared with 2022, due to improved overall insured loss experience before catastrophe effects, as price increases helped to offset elevated losses reflecting economic or other forms of inflation that increased our uncertainty regarding ultimate losses. loss experience in 2022 was much worse than in 2021, including higher current accident year loss and loss expenses before catastrophe losses that rose 20%, exceeding earned premium growth of 12%. loss experience is discussed further in financial results for our property casualty business and related segments. the $261 million improvement in 2023 underwriting profit, compared with 2022, also included a $31 million increase in losses from natural catastrophe events and $81 million more benefit from net favorable reserve development on prior accident years before catastrophe losses. the $591 million decrease in 2022, compared with excellent results in 2021, included a $135 million increase in losses from catastrophe events and $276 million less benefit from net favorable reserve development on prior accident years before catastrophe losses.
we measure property casualty underwriting profitability primarily by the combined ratio. our combined ratio measures the percentage of each earned premium dollar spent on claims plus all expenses related to our property casualty operations, all on a pretax basis. a lower ratio indicates more favorable results and better underlying performance. a ratio below 100% represents an underwriting profit. initiatives to improve our combined ratio are discussed in item 1, our business and our strategy, strategic initiatives. in 2023, 2022 and 2021, favorable development on reserves for claims that occurred in prior accident years helped offset other incurred losses and loss expenses. reserve development is discussed further in property casualty loss and loss expense cincinnati financial corporation - 2023 10-k - page 52
obligations and reserves. losses from weather-related catastrophes are another important item influencing the combined ratio and are discussed along with other factors in financial results for our property casualty business and related segments.
our life insurance segment reported a profit of $41 million in 2023 and profit of $27 million in 2022. we discuss results for the segment in life insurance results. most of this segment's investment income is included in our investments segment results. in addition to investment income, investment gains from the life insurance investment portfolio are also included in our investments segment results.
critical accounting estimates cincinnati financial corporation's financial statements are prepared using u.s. gaap. these principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements are discussed in item 8, note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. in conjunction with that discussion, material implications of uncertainties associated with the methods, assumptions and estimates underlying the company's critical accounting policies are discussed below. the audit committee of the board of directors reviews the annual financial statements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. these discussions cover: the quality of earnings; review of reserves and accruals; reconsideration of the suitability of accounting principles; review of highly judgmental areas including critical accounting estimates; audit adjustments; and such other inquiries as may be appropriate.
property casualty insurance loss and loss expense reserves we establish loss and loss expense reserves for our property casualty insurance business as balance sheet liabilities. unpaid loss and loss expenses are the estimated amounts necessary to pay for and settle all outstanding insured claims, including incurred but not reported (ibnr) claims. these reserves account for unpaid loss and loss expenses as of a financial statement date.
for some lines of business that we write, a considerable and uncertain amount of time can elapse between the occurrence, reporting and payment of insured claims. the amount we will actually have to pay for such claims also can be highly uncertain. this uncertainty, together with the size of our reserves, makes the loss and loss expense reserves our most significant estimate. gross loss and loss expense reserves were $8.975 billion at year-end 2023 compared with $8.336 billion at year-end 2022.
how reserves are established our field claims representatives establish case reserves when claims are reported to the company to provide for our unpaid loss and loss expense obligation associated with known claims. field claims managers supervise and review all claims with case reserves less than $100,000. additionally, a headquarters supervisor and regional claims manager review claims under $100,000 if litigation or a certain specialty claim is involved. all claims with case reserves of $100,000 or greater are reviewed and approved by experienced headquarters supervisors and regional claims managers. upper-level headquarters claims managers also review case reserves of $175,000 or more.
our claims representatives base their case reserve estimates primarily upon case-by-case evaluations that consider:
•type of claim involved
•circumstances surrounding each claim
•policy provisions pertaining to each claim
•potential for subrogation or salvage recoverable
•general insurance reserving practices case reserves of all sizes are generally reviewed on a 90-day cycle, or more frequently if new information about a loss becomes available. as part of the review process, we monitor industry trends, cost trends, relevant court cases, legislative activity and other current events in an effort to ascertain new or additional loss exposures.
cincinnati financial corporation - 2023 10-k - page 53
we also establish ibnr reserves to provide for all unpaid loss and loss expenses not accounted for by case reserves:
•for events designated as natural catastrophes resulting in losses incurred related to premiums written on a direct basis by the cincinnati insurance companies, we calculate ibnr reserves directly as a result of an estimated ibnr claim count and an estimated average claim amount for each event. once case reserves are established for a catastrophe event, we reduce the ibnr reserves. our claims department management coordinates the assessment of these events and prepares the related ibnr reserve estimates. such an assessment involves a comprehensive analysis of the nature of the event, of policyholder exposures within the affected geographic area and of available claims intelligence. depending on the nature of the event, available claims intelligence could include surveys of field claims representatives within the affected geographic area, feedback from a catastrophe claims team sent into the area, as well as data on claims reported as of the financial statement date.
to determine whether an event is designated as a catastrophe, related to premiums written on a direct basis by the cincinnati insurance companies, we generally use the catastrophe definition provided by property claims service (pcs), a division of insurance services office. pcs defines a catastrophe as an event that causes u.s., puerto rico and u.s. virgin islands damage of $25 million or more in insured property losses and affects a significant number of policyholders and insureds.
•for events designated as natural catastrophes resulting in losses for cincinnati re and cincinnati global, we begin with a review of in-force policies, treaties and related limits likely to be affected by each event. for both cincinnati re and cincinnati global, use of information from third-party catastrophe models, industry estimates, and our own proprietary adjustments are used for the estimate of ultimate losses for each catastrophe event. incurred losses from catastrophe events for both cincinnati re and cincinnati global can be designated catastrophes by pcs, or deemed as a catastrophe by the international insurance industry or, for cincinnati re, as reported by ceding companies. ibnr reserves are calculated as the difference between the estimate of the ultimate loss and loss expenses and the sum of total loss and loss expense payments and total case reserves.
•for asbestos and environmental claims, we calculate ibnr reserves by deriving an actuarially-based estimate of total unpaid loss and loss expenses. we then reduce the estimate by total case reserves. we discuss the reserve analysis that applies to asbestos and environmental reserves in liquidity and capital resources, asbestos and environmental loss and loss expense reserves.
•for loss expenses that pertain primarily to salaries and other costs related to our claims associates, also referred to as adjusting and other expense or aoe, we calculate reserves based on an analysis of the relationship between paid losses and paid aoe. reserves for aoe are allocated to company, line of business and accident year based on a claim count algorithm. claim counts reported and used in the reserving process are primarily measured by insurance coverages that are triggered when a loss occurs and a reserve is established. coverages are defined as unique combinations of certain attributes such as line of business and cause of loss. claims that are opened and closed without payment are included in the reported claim counts. claim counts are presented on a direct basis only and do not reflect any assumed or ceded reinsurance.
•for all other claims and events, including reinsurance assumed or ceded, ibnr reserves are calculated as the difference between an actuarial estimate of the ultimate cost of total loss and loss expenses incurred reduced by the sum of total loss and loss expense payments and total case reserves estimated for individual claims. reserve amounts for those other claims and events are significant, and represent the majority of amounts shown as ibnr reserves and loss expense reserves in the table included in liquidity and capital resources, property casualty loss and loss expense obligations and reserves. we discuss below the development of actuarially based estimates of the ultimate cost of total loss and loss expenses incurred.
our actuarial staff applies significant judgment in selecting models and estimating model parameters when preparing reserve analyses. unpaid loss and loss expenses are inherently uncertain as to timing and amount. uncertainties relating to model appropriateness, parameter estimates and actual loss and loss expense amounts are referred to as model, parameter and process uncertainty, respectively. our management and actuarial staff address these uncertainties in the reserving process in a variety of ways.
cincinnati financial corporation - 2023 10-k - page 54
our actuarial staff bases its ibnr reserve estimates for these losses primarily on the indications of methods and models that analyze accident year data. accident year is the year in which an insured claim, loss or loss expense occurred. the specific methods and models that our actuaries have used for the past several years are:
•paid and reported loss development methods
•paid and reported loss bornhuetter-ferguson methods
•individual and multiple probabilistic trend family models our actuarial staff uses diagnostics to evaluate the appropriateness of the models and methods listed above. the appropriateness of these models and methods for estimating ibnr reserves tends to depend on the tail for a line of business. tail refers to the time interval between a typical claim's occurrence and its settlement. the loss development and bornhuetter-ferguson methods, particularly the reported loss variations, tend to produce more appropriate ibnr reserve estimates for our short-tail lines such as homeowner and commercial property. for our mid-tail and long-tail lines, all models and methods provide useful insights.
our actuarial staff also devotes significant time and effort to the estimation of model and method parameters. the loss development and bornhuetter-ferguson methods require the estimation of numerous loss development factors. the bornhuetter-ferguson methods also involve the estimation of numerous expected loss ratios by accident year. models from the probabilistic trend family require the estimation of development trends, calendar year inflation trends and exposure levels. consequently, our actuarial staff monitors a number of trends and measures to gain key business insights necessary for exercising appropriate judgment when estimating the parameters mentioned, such as:
•company and industry pricing
•company and industry exposure
•company and industry loss frequency and severity
•past large loss events
•company and industry premium
•company in-force policy count these trends and measures also support the estimation of expected accident year loss ratios needed for applying the bornhuetter-ferguson methods and for assessing the reasonability of all ibnr reserve estimates computed. our actuarial staff reviews these trends and measures quarterly, updating parameters derived from them as necessary.
quarterly, our actuarial staff summarizes their reserve analysis by preparing an actuarial best estimate and a range of reasonable ibnr reserves intended to reflect the uncertainty of the estimate. an inter-departmental committee that includes our actuarial management team reviews the results of each quarterly reserve analysis. the committee establishes management's best estimate of ibnr reserves, which is the amount that is included in each period's financial statements. in addition to the information provided by actuarial staff, the committee also considers factors such as:
•large loss activity and trends in large losses
•new business activity
•judicial decisions
•general economic trends such as inflation
•trends in litigiousness and legal expenses
•product and underwriting changes
•changes in claims practices cincinnati financial corporation - 2023 10-k - page 55
the determination of management's best estimate, like the preparation of the reserve analysis that supports it, involves considerable judgment. changes in reserving data or the trends and factors that influence reserving data may signal fundamental shifts or may simply reflect single-period anomalies. even if a change reflects a fundamental shift, the full extent of the change may not become evident until years later. moreover, since our methods and models do not explicitly relate many of the factors we consider directly to reserve levels, we typically cannot quantify the precise impact of such factors on the adequacy of reserves prospectively or retrospectively.
due to the uncertainties described above, our ultimate loss experience could prove better or worse than our carried reserves reflect. to the extent that reserves are inadequate and increased, the amount of the increase is a charge in the period that the deficiency is recognized, raising our loss and loss expense ratio and reducing earnings. to the extent that reserves are redundant and released, the amount of the release is a credit in the period that the redundancy is recognized, reducing our loss and loss expense ratio and increasing earnings.
key assumptions - loss reserving our actuarial staff makes a number of key assumptions when using their methods and models to derive ibnr reserve estimates. appropriate reliance on these key assumptions essentially entails determinations of the likelihood that statistically significant patterns in historical data may extend into the future. the four most significant of the key assumptions used by our actuarial staff and approved by management are:
•emergence of loss and defense and cost containment expenses, also referred to as dcce, on an accident year basis. historical paid loss, reported loss and paid dcce data for the business lines we analyze contain patterns that reflect how unpaid losses, unreported losses and unpaid dcce as of a financial statement date will emerge in the future. unless our actuarial staff or management identifies reasons or factors that invalidate the extension of historical patterns into the future, these patterns can be used to make projections necessary for estimating ibnr reserves. our actuaries significantly rely on this assumption in the application of all methods and models mentioned above.
•calendar year inflation. for long-tail and mid-tail business lines, calendar year inflation trends for future paid losses and paid dcce do not vary significantly from a stable, long-term average. our actuaries base reserve estimates derived from probabilistic trend family models on this assumption.
•exposure levels. historical earned premiums, when adjusted to reflect common levels of product pricing and loss cost inflation, can serve as a proxy for historical exposures. our actuaries require this assumption to estimate expected loss ratios and expected dcce ratios used by the bornhuetter-ferguson reserving methods. they may also use this assumption to establish exposure levels for recent accident years, characterized by "green" or immature data, when working with probabilistic trend family models.
•claims having atypical emergence patterns. characteristics of certain subsets of claims, such as high frequency, high severity, or mass tort claims, have the potential to distort patterns contained in historical paid loss, reported loss and paid dcce data. when testing indicates this to be the case for a particular subset of claims, our actuaries segregate these claims from the data and analyze them separately. subsets of claims that could fall into this category include hurricane claims or claims for other weather events where total losses we incurred were very large, individual large claims and asbestos and environmental claims.
these key assumptions have not changed since 2005, when our actuarial staff began using probabilistic trend family models to estimate ibnr reserves.
paid losses, reported losses and paid dcce are subject to random as well as systematic influences. as a result, actual paid losses, reported losses and paid dcce are virtually certain to differ from projections. such differences are consistent with what specific models for our business lines predict and with the related patterns in the historical data used to develop these models. as a result, management does not closely monitor statistically insignificant differences between actual and projected data.

reserve estimate variability management believes that the standard error of a reserve estimate, a measure of the estimate's variability, provides the most appropriate measure of the estimate's sensitivity. the reserves we establish depend on the models we use and the related parameters we estimate in the course of conducting reserve analyses. however, the actual amount required to settle all outstanding insured claims, including ibnr claims, as of a financial statement date depends on stochastic, or random, elements as well as the systematic elements captured by our models and estimated model parameters. for the lines of business we write, process uncertainty - the inherent variability of loss and loss expense payments - typically contributes more to the imprecision of a reserve estimate than parameter uncertainty.
consequently, a sensitivity measure that ignores process uncertainty would provide an incomplete picture of the reserve estimate's sensitivity. since a reserve estimate's standard error accounts for both process and parameter uncertainty, it reflects the estimate's full sensitivity to a range of reasonably likely scenarios.
the table below provides standard errors and reserve ranges by major property casualty lines of business and in total for net loss and loss expense reserves as well as the potential effects on our net income, assuming a 21% federal tax rate. standard errors and reserve ranges for assorted groupings of these lines of business cannot be computed by simply adding the standard errors and reserve ranges of the component lines of business, since such an approach would ignore the effects of product diversification. see liquidity and capital resources, property casualty loss and loss expense obligations and reserves, range of reasonable reserves, for more details on our total reserve range. while the table reflects our assessment of the most likely range within which each line's actual unpaid loss and loss expenses may fall, one or more lines' actual unpaid loss and loss expenses could nonetheless fall outside of the indicated ranges.

life policy and investment contract reserves we establish the reserves for traditional life policies, including term, whole life and other products based on certain cash flow assumptions including mortality and lapse rates. these assumptions are established based on our current expectations and are reviewed annually to determine any necessary updates. they are also updated on an interim basis if evidence suggests that they should be revised. we use both our own experience and industry experience, adjusted for historical trends, in arriving at our cash flow assumptions. these reserves also include a discount rate assumption that is based on upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument yields (market value discount rates) and is updated quarterly.
the gross reserve balance for term and whole life policy reserves was $1.500 billion, or 48.9%, of total life policy and investment contract reserves at december 31, 2023. the following table summarizes the sensitivity, on a net basis, of our term and whole life policy reserves and reinsurance recoverable amounts to hypothetical changes in key assumptions and the resulting increase/(decrease) to pretax net income and pretax other comprehensive income:

we establish reserves for our universal life, deferred annuity and other investment contracts, equal to the cumulative account balances, which include premium deposits plus credited interest less charges and withdrawals. charges include surrender and contract administration charges as well as asset-based fees. the reserve balance for these contracts was $1.343 billion, or 43.8%, of total life policy and investment contract reserves, at december 31, 2023.
some of our universal life insurance policies contain no-lapse guarantee provisions. for these policies, we establish a reserve, or other additional liability, in addition to the account balance based on expected no-lapse guarantee benefits and expected policy assessments. key assumptions used to establish this other additional liability reserve are expected investment returns and projected lapse rates. these assumptions, and other relevant inputs, are reviewed annually and on an interim basis in line with the process described above for traditional life policies. the reserve balance was $128 million, or 4.2%, of total life policy and investment contract reserves at december 31, 2023, and is included as a component of universal life reserves in item 8, note 5 of the consolidated financial statements.
asset impairment our investment portfolio is our largest asset. we monitor the fixed-maturity portfolio and all other assets for signs of credit-related or other impairment. we monitor decreases in the fair value of invested assets and the need for an allowance for credit losses for our fixed-maturity portfolio; allowances for expected credit losses on receivable and recoverable assets considering past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts; an accumulation of company costs in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct an asset; or other factors such as bankruptcy, deterioration of creditworthiness or failure to pay interest; and changes in legal factors or in the business climate.

the application of our invested assets impairment policy resulted in write-downs of impaired securities intended to be sold that reduced our income before income taxes by $4 million in 2023, $5 million in 2022 and $1 million in 2021. write-downs represent noncash charges to income and are reported as investment losses. the application of our noninvested assets impairment policy did not have a material effect on our financial condition in 2023 or 2022.
our internal investment portfolio managers monitor their assigned portfolios. if a fixed-maturity security is valued below amortized cost, the portfolio managers undertake additional reviews. such declines often occur in conjunction with events taking place in the overall economy and market, combined with events specific to the industry or operations of the issuing organization. managers review quantitative measurements such as a declining trend in fair value and the extent of the fair value decline, as well as qualitative measures such as pending events, credit ratings and issuer liquidity. we are even more proactive when these declines in valuation are greater than might be anticipated when viewed in the context of overall economic and market conditions. we provide detailed information about fixed-maturity securities fair valued in a continuous loss position at year-end 2023 in item 7a, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
an available for sale fixed maturity is impaired if the fair value of the security is below amortized cost. the impaired loss is charged to net income when we have the intent to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost. for impaired securities we intend to hold, an allowance for credit related losses is recorded in investment losses when the company determines a credit loss has been incurred based on certain factors such as adverse conditions, credit rating downgrades or failure of the issuer to make scheduled principal or interest payments. a credit loss is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis by comparing the present value of expected cash flows with the amortized cost basis, limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost. noncredit losses are recognized in other comprehensive income as a change in unrealized gains and losses on investments. we provide information about valuations of our invested assets in item 8, note 2 of the consolidated financial statements.

fair value measurements valuation of financial instruments fair value is defined as the exit price or the amount that would be (1) received to sell an asset or (2) paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between marketplace participants at the measurement date. when determining an exit price, we must, whenever possible, rely upon observable market data.
we have categorized our financial instruments, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy. the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3). if the inputs used to measure the financial instruments fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the lowest level that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument. while we consider pricing data from outside services, we ultimately determine whether the data or inputs used by these outside services are observable or unobservable.
financial assets and liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as described in item 8, note 3 of the consolidated financial statements.
level 1 and level 2 valuation techniques substantially all of the $24.780 billion of securities in our investment portfolio at year-end 2023, measured at fair value, are classified as level 1 or level 2. financial assets that fall within level 1 and level 2 are priced according to observable data from identical or similar securities that have traded in the marketplace. also within level 2 are securities that are valued by outside services or brokers where we have evaluated and verified the pricing methodology and determined that the inputs are observable.
recent accounting pronouncements information about recent accounting pronouncements is provided in item 8, note 1 of the consolidated financial statements.

financial results consolidated financial results primarily reflect the results of our five reporting segments. these segments are defined based on financial information we use to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of assets.
•commercial lines insurance
•personal lines insurance
•excess and surplus lines insurance
•life insurance
•investments we report as other the noninvestment operations of the parent company and its noninsurer subsidiary, cfc investment company. in addition, other includes the financial results of our reinsurance assumed operations, known as cincinnati re®, and our london-based global specialty underwriter, known as cincinnati global underwriting ltd.sm (cincinnati global).
we measure profit or loss for our commercial lines, personal lines, excess and surplus lines and life insurance segments based upon underwriting results (profit or loss), which represent net earned premium less loss and loss expenses, or contract holders' benefits incurred, and underwriting expenses on a pretax basis. we also evaluate results for our consolidated property casualty insurance operations. that is the total of our standard market segments (commercial lines and personal lines), our excess and surplus lines insurance segment, cincinnati re and cincinnati global. for analysis of our consolidated property casualty insurance results, it is important to include the earned premiums, loss and loss expenses and also underwriting expenses reported as other. underwriting results and segment pretax operating income are not substitutes for net income determined in accordance with gaap.
for our consolidated property casualty insurance operations as well as the insurance segments, statutory accounting data and ratios are key performance indicators that we use to assess business trends and to make comparisons to industry results, since gaap-based industry data generally is not as readily available.
investments held by the parent company and the investment portfolios for the insurance subsidiaries are managed and reported as the investments segment, separate from our underwriting business. net investment income and net investment gains and losses for our investment portfolios are discussed in the investments results.
the calculations of segment data are described in more detail in item 8, note 18, of the consolidated financial statements. the following sections provide analysis and discussion of results of operations for each of the five segments.

consolidated property casualty insurance results earned and net written premiums for our consolidated property casualty operations grew in 2023, reflecting average renewal price increases, a higher level of insured exposures and strategic initiatives for targeted growth. a key measure of property casualty profitability is underwriting profit or loss. profit increased in 2023, reflecting improved overall insured loss experience before catastrophe effects, as price increases helped to offset elevated losses reflecting economic or other forms of inflation that increased our uncertainty regarding ultimate losses. our 2023 underwriting profit of $401 million was $261 million more than in 2022, including a $31 million unfavorable effect from a higher amount of catastrophe losses, mostly caused by severe weather. prior accident year loss experience before catastrophes during 2023 was more favorable than in 2022, and represented $81 million of the 2023 underwriting profit increase. we continue working to improve underwriting profitability, such as through higher pricing and our ongoing initiatives to improve pricing precision and loss experience related to claims and loss control practices. underwriting profit trends are discussed further below.

reserve development performance highlights for consolidated property casualty operations include:
•premiums - agency renewal written premiums rose $596 million or 11% in 2023 and continued to contribute to growth in earned premiums and net written premiums that rose in each of our property casualty insurance segments. the renewal premium increase was largely due to average renewal price increases and a higher level of insured exposures. price increases with enhanced precision continue to benefit operating results.
new business written premiums produced through agencies increased $145 million in 2023, compared with 2022. agents appointed during 2023 or 2022 produced a 2023 increase in standard lines new business of $65 million.

growth initiatives also favorably affect growth in subsequent years, particularly as newer agency relationships mature over time.
cincinnati re produced $558 million of 2023 net written premiums and had a negative contribution of $27 million to growth in other written premiums, compared with 2022. cincinnati re assumes risks through reinsurance treaties and in some cases cedes part of the risk and related premiums to one or more unaffiliated reinsurance companies through transactions known as retrocessions. in 2023, earned premiums for cincinnati re totaled $529 million.
cincinnati global had a positive contribution to the increase in other written premiums. net written premiums were $280 million in 2023, and contributed $50 million of the growth in other written premiums, compared with 2022. in 2023, earned premiums for cincinnati global totaled $266 million.
other written premiums also include premiums ceded to reinsurers as part of our ceded reinsurance program. an increase in ceded premiums, other than cincinnati re and cincinnati global premiums, reduced net written premium growth by $18 million in 2023.

•combined ratio - the combined ratio improved by 3.2 percentage points in 2023, compared with 2022, including a 0.5 percentage-point decrease in the ratio for catastrophe losses. the 2023 ratio for current accident year losses and loss expenses before catastrophes decreased by 1.8 percentage points. that ratio improvement included an increase of 1.9 points for the ibnr portion and a decrease of 3.7 points for the case incurred portion. price increases and other underwriting efforts have helped to offset losses that have elevated significantly since 2021 due to inflation effects discussed below, as earned premiums in 2023 grew faster than those losses and loss expenses. the remainder of the 2023 combined ratio improvement included 0.9 percentage points more benefit in the ratio for prior accident year losses and loss expenses before catastrophes. we further discuss ratios related to reserve development in the sections that follow the catastrophe losses incurred table below.
elevated inflation since 2021 has resulted in higher losses and loss expenses as costs have increased significantly to repair damaged autos or other property that we insure. we also experienced higher losses for liability coverages for some of our lines of business. higher losses and loss expenses for various lines of business reflect increased uncertainty of estimated ultimate losses. until longer-term paid loss cost trends become more clear, we intend to remain prudent in reserving for estimated ultimate losses. we believe future property casualty underwriting results will continue to benefit from price increases and our ongoing initiatives to improve pricing precision and loss experience related to claims and loss control practices.
our statutory combined ratio was 94.6% in 2023 compared with 97.7% in 2022 and 87.9% in 2021. the estimated statutory combined ratio for the property casualty industry, with the industry's ratio excluding its mortgage and financial guaranty lines of business and based on industry data reported through the first nine months of 2023, was 103.4% in 2023, 104.0% in 2022 and 100.0% in 2021. the contribution of catastrophe losses to our statutory combined ratio was 8.8 percentage points in 2023, 8.9 percentage points in 2022 and 7.6 percentage points in 2021, compared with industry estimates of 9.8, 6.8 and 7.4 percentage points, respectively, with 2023 representing industry data reported through the first nine months of 2023. components of the combined ratio are discussed below.
catastrophe loss trends are an important factor in assessing trends for overall underwriting results. our 10-year historical annual average contribution of catastrophe losses to the combined ratio was 7.7 percentage points at december 31, 2023. our five-year average was 8.8 percentage points.

effective june 1, 2023, we restructured our reinsurance program for cincinnati re that included property catastrophe excess of loss coverage. the restructured treaties are for a period of one year and provide $40 million of coverage for various combinations of occurrences for business written in north america on a direct basis and by cincinnati re. cincinnati global catastrophe losses are not applicable to the treaty. there is a per occurrence limit of $20 million for cincinnati re catastrophe losses in excess of $80 million per event. the remaining coverage is for business written by cincinnati re and on a direct basis that applies to catastrophe losses in excess of $600 million per event. during 2023, there was no recovery from reinsurers for losses pertaining to these treaties.
the following table shows catastrophe losses incurred for the past two calendar years, net of reinsurance, as well as the effect of loss development on prior period catastrophe reserves. we individually list declared catastrophe events for which our incurred losses reached or exceeded $25 million.

consolidated property casualty insurance loss and loss expenses loss and loss expenses include both net paid losses and reserve changes for unpaid losses as well as the associated loss expenses. for all property casualty lines of business in aggregate, net loss and loss expense reserves at december 31, 2023, were $682 million higher than at year-end 2022, including $634 million for incurred but not reported (ibnr) reserves. the $682 million reserve increase raised year-end 2022 net loss and loss expense reserves by 9%, compared with a 10% increase in 2023 earned premiums.
most of the incurred losses and loss expenses shown in the consolidated property casualty insurance results three-year highlights table are for the respective current accident years, with reserve development on prior accident years shown separately. since less than half of our consolidated property casualty current accident year incurred losses and loss expenses represents net paid amounts, the majority represents reserves for our estimate of ultimate losses and loss expenses. these reserves develop over time, and we re-estimate previously reported reserves as we learn more about the development of the related claims. the table below illustrates that development. for example, the 70.4% accident year 2022 loss and loss expense ratio reported as of december 31, 2022, developed favorably by 2.0 percentage points to 68.4% due to claims settling for less than previously estimated, or due to updated reserve estimates for unpaid claims, as of december 31, 2023. accident years 2022 and 2021 have both developed favorably, as indicated by the progression over time for the ratios in the table.

catastrophe loss trends, discussed above, accounted for some of the movement in the current accident year loss and loss expense ratio for 2023, compared with 2022. catastrophe losses added 9.3 percentage points in 2023, 10.2 points in 2022 and 9.1 points in 2021 to the respective consolidated property casualty current accident year loss and loss expense ratios in the table above.
the 58.4% ratio for current accident year loss and loss expenses before catastrophe losses for 2023 decreased 1.8 percentage points compared with the 60.2% accident year 2022 ratio measured as of december 31, 2022. the decrease included a 0.3 percentage-point decrease in the ratio for current accident year losses of $2 million or more per claim, shown in the table below.
reserve development on prior accident years continued to net to a favorable amount in 2023, and was primarily due to less-than-anticipated loss emergence on known claims. we recognized $215 million of favorable development in 2023, compared with $159 million in 2022 and $428 million in 2021. of the $56 million increase in 2023, compared with 2022, $45 million was attributable to our commercial auto and personal auto lines of business. approximately 80% of our net favorable reserve development on prior accident years recognized during 2023 occurred in our workers' compensation, commercial property and homeowner lines of business. in 2022, our workers' compensation and homeowner lines of business were responsible for approximately 74% of the favorable reserve development. as discussed in liquidity and capital resources, property casualty loss and loss expense obligations and reserves, property casualty insurance development of estimated reserves by accident year, commercial casualty and workers' compensation are considered long-tail lines with the potential for revisions inherent in estimating reserves. favorable development recognized during 2021 was primarily from our commercial casualty, commercial property and workers' compensation lines of business. development by accident year is further discussed in liquidity and capital resources, property casualty insurance development of estimated reserves by accident year.

in 2023, total large losses incurred increased by $71 million, or 23%, net of reinsurance, primarily due to an increase for our commercial lines insurance segment. the corresponding 2023 ratio increased 0.5 percentage points, compared with 2022. the large loss data included in the table above does not include cincinnati re and cincinnati global. our analysis of large losses incurred indicated no unexpected concentration of these losses and reserve increases by geographic region, policy inception, agency or field marketing territory. we believe the inherent volatility of aggregate loss experience for our portfolio of larger policies is greater than that of our portfolio of smaller policies, and we continue to monitor the volatility in addition to general inflationary trends in loss costs.

consolidated property casualty commission expenses rose $119 million, or 9%, in 2023, with profit-sharing commissions for agencies increasing by $10 million. the 2023 ratio of commission expenses as a percent of earned premiums decreased by 0.3 percentage points, compared with 2022. the 2023 ratio for other underwriting expenses increased by 0.3 percentage points, compared with 2022. earned premiums rose at a slower pace than other underwriting expenses during 2023, and we continued to carefully manage expenses while also making strategic investments that include enhancement of underwriting expertise.
commission expenses include our profit-sharing commissions, which are primarily based on one-year and three-year profitability of an agency's business. the aggregate profit trend for agencies that earn these profit-based commissions can differ from the aggregate profit trend for all agencies reflected in our consolidated property casualty results.
salaries, benefits and payroll taxes for our associates account for approximately half of our property casualty other underwriting expenses. most of our associates either provide direct service to the property casualty portion of our agencies' businesses or provide support to those associates.
discussions below of our property casualty insurance segments provide additional details about our results.

reserve development performance highlights for the commercial lines insurance segment include:
•premiums - earned premiums and net written premiums rose in 2023, including a $204 million, or 6%, increase in renewal written premiums that continued to include higher average pricing and a higher level of insured exposures. new business written premiums in 2023 decreased $16 million, or 3%, compared with 2022, reflecting pricing discipline in a highly competitive environment.
•combined ratio - the 2023 combined ratio improved by 3.0 percentage points compared with 2022, despite a 0.2 percentage-point increase in the ratio component for catastrophe losses. development on prior accident years loss and loss expense reserves before catastrophes during 2023 was 1.3 percentage points more favorable than in 2022. the 2023 combined ratio also improved by 2.1 points due to a lower ratio for current accident year loss and loss expenses before catastrophe losses, compared with 2022. that ratio improvement included an increase of 2.4 points for the ibnr portion and a decrease of 4.5 points for the case incurred portion. price increases and other underwriting actions have helped offset losses that have elevated significantly since 2021 due to inflation effects, as earned premiums in 2023 grew faster than those losses and loss expenses.
when estimating the ultimate cost of total loss and loss expenses, we consider many factors, including trends for inflation, historical paid and reported losses, large loss activity and other data or information for the industry or our company. elevated inflation since 2021 has resulted in higher losses and loss expenses as costs have increased significantly to repair damaged business property or autos that we insure, in addition to higher losses for liability coverages for some of our lines of business. due to increased uncertainty regarding ultimate losses, we intend to remain prudent in reserving for estimated ultimate losses until longer-term loss cost trends become more clear.

commercial umbrella coverages are part of our commercial casualty line of business that help protect businesses against liability from occurrences such as accidents or injuries. following a significantly unfavorable effect on our 2022 ratios for losses and expenses, commercial umbrella contributed a favorable decrease of approximately 2.2 percentage points to the commercial lines segment 2023 ratio for loss and loss expenses decrease of 3.2% shown in the table above. incurred losses and loss expenses for commercial umbrella coverages of $346 million in 2023 decreased $70 million, or 17%, compared with 2022, including an increase in net paid losses of $7 million. the $70 million decrease in losses and loss expenses included a decrease of $39 million or 24% for the ibnr portion, while earned premiums of $502 million increased 1%. the estimated combined ratio for commercial umbrella for 2023 was 98%, compared with an estimated 112% for 2022, and its 2023 earned premiums represented approximately 34% of our commercial casualty premiums. severe losses from commercial auto accidents were the primary source of our commercial umbrella claims during 2023 and also in recent years.
pricing precision and other initiatives to improve commercial lines underwriting profitability complement our business practices that continue to leverage the local presence of our field associates. field marketing representatives meet with local agencies to assess each risk, determine limits of insurance and establish appropriate terms and conditions. they underwrite new business, with collaboration and expertise from headquarters associates as needed, while field loss control, machinery and equipment and claims representatives conduct on-site inspections. field claims representatives also assist underwriters by preparing full reports on their first-hand observations of risk quality.
our commercial lines statutory combined ratio was 95.6% in 2023, compared with 98.5% in 2022 and 83.2% in 2021. the contribution of catastrophe losses to our commercial lines statutory combined ratio was 7.2 percentage points in 2023, 7.0 percentage points in 2022 and 3.4 percentage points in 2021.

we continue to refine our use of predictive analytics tools to improve pricing precision as we further segment commercial lines policies, emphasizing identification and retention of policies we believe have relatively stronger price adequacy. these tools better align individual insurance policy pricing to risk attributes, providing our underwriters with enhanced abilities to target profitability and to discuss pricing impacts with our agencies. we also continue to leverage our local relationships with agents through the efforts of our teams that work closely with them. we believe our field focus is unique and has several advantages, including providing us with quality intelligence on local market conditions. we seek to maintain appropriate pricing discipline for both new and renewal business as management continues to emphasize the importance of our agencies and underwriters assessing account quality to make careful decisions on a case-by-case basis whether to write as new business or renew a policy. premium rate credits may be used to retain renewals of quality business and to earn new business, but we do so selectively in order to avoid commercial accounts that we believe have insufficient profit margins.
our 6% increase in 2023 agency renewal written premiums included higher average pricing. we measure average changes in commercial lines renewal pricing as the rate of change in renewal premium for the new policy period compared with the premium for the expiring policy period, assuming no change in the level of insured exposures or policy coverage between those periods for respective policies. in 2023, our standard commercial lines policies averaged an estimated pricing change at a percentage near the low end of the high-single-digit range. our average commercial lines pricing change includes the flat pricing effect of certain coverages within package policies written for a three-year term that were in force but did not expire during the period being measured. therefore, the average commercial lines pricing change we report reflects a blend of policies that did not expire and other policies that did expire during the measurement period.
cincinnati financial corporation - 2023 10-k - page 69
for only those commercial lines policies that did expire and were then renewed during 2023, we estimate that the average price increase was at a percentage in the high-single-digit range. during 2023, we continued to further segment our commercial lines policies, emphasizing identification and retention of policies we believed had relatively stronger price adequacy. conversely, we continued to seek more aggressive renewal terms and conditions on policies we believed had relatively weaker pricing, in turn retaining fewer of those policies.
our 2023 increase of 6% for the commercial lines segment's agency renewal written premiums also included a higher level of insured exposures, in addition to other factors such as changes in policy retention rates or changes in mix of business that can cause variation in average premiums per policy. part of the insured exposure increase reflects our response to inflation effects that increase the cost of building materials to repair damaged commercial structures. we use building valuation software to automate much of that underwriting process and may also manually adjust premiums to reflect property costs.
changes in the economy can affect insured exposures that directly relate to premium amounts charged for some policies. for commercial accounts, we usually calculate initial estimates for general liability premiums based on estimated sales or payroll volume, while we calculate workers' compensation premiums based on estimated payroll volume. a change in sales or payroll volume generally indicates a change in demand for a business's goods or services, as well as a change in its exposure to risk. policyholders who experience sales or payroll volume changes due to economic factors may also have other exposures requiring insurance, such as commercial auto or commercial property. premium levels for these other types of coverages generally are not linked directly to sales or payroll volumes.
premiums resulting from audits of actual sales or payrolls that confirmed or adjusted initial premium estimates are part of net written premiums and earned premiums. the contribution to our commercial lines earned premiums was $157 million, $127 million and $47 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the contribution on a net written premium basis was $136 million, $101 million and $44 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. these net written premium amounts are included with agency renewal written premiums in the commercial lines insurance premiums table above.
in 2023, our commercial lines new business premiums written by our agencies decreased $16 million, or 3%, compared with 2022, reflecting pricing discipline in a highly competitive environment. new business premium volume in recent years has been significantly influenced by new agency appointments. agencies appointed since the beginning of 2022 produced commercial lines new business written premiums of $47 million, in aggregate, during 2023, up $34 million from what they produced during 2022. all other agencies contributed the remaining $537 million, down $50 million from the $587 million they produced in 2022.
for new business, our field associates are frequently meeting with our agents to: help judge the quality of each account; emphasize the cincinnati value proposition; call on sales prospects with those agents; and provide appropriate quotes after carefully evaluating risk exposures. some of our new business comes from accounts that are not new to the agent. we believe these seasoned accounts tend to be priced more accurately than business that is new to us and the agency. as we appoint new agencies who choose to move accounts to us, we report these accounts as new business to us.
other written premiums primarily consist of premiums that are ceded to reinsurers and lower our net written premiums. an increase in ceded premiums reduced net written premium growth by $11 million in 2023.

commercial lines insurance loss and loss expenses loss and loss expenses include both net paid losses and reserve changes for unpaid losses as well as the associated loss expenses. most of the incurred losses and loss expenses shown in the commercial lines insurance segment three-year highlights table are for the respective current accident years, with reserve development on prior accident years shown separately. since less than half of our commercial lines insurance segment current accident year incurred losses and loss expenses represents net paid amounts, the majority represents reserves for our estimate of ultimate losses and loss expenses. these reserves develop over time, and we re-estimate previously reported reserves as we learn more about development on the related claims. the table below illustrates that development. for example, the 70.5% accident year 2022 loss and loss expense ratio reported as of december 31, 2022, developed favorably by 1.7 percentage points to 68.8% due to claims settling for less than previously estimated, or due to updates to reserve estimates for unpaid claims, as of december 31, 2023. accident years 2022 and 2021 for the commercial lines insurance segment have both developed favorably, as indicated by the progression over time of the ratios in the table.

catastrophe losses, as discussed in consolidated property casualty insurance results, explain some of the movement in the current accident year loss and loss expense ratio for accident year 2023, compared with 2022. catastrophe losses added 7.4 percentage points in 2023, 7.6 points in 2022 and 4.6 points in 2021 to the respective commercial lines current accident year loss and loss expense ratios in the table above.
the 60.8% ratio for current accident year loss and loss expenses before catastrophe losses for 2023 decreased 2.1 percentage points compared with the 62.9% accident year 2022 ratio measured as of december 31, 2022. the decrease included an increase in large losses incurred, described below including a table with corresponding ratios for new losses above $2 million, with a 0.2 percentage-point decrease in the 2023 ratio. other contributions to the ratio decrease of 2.1 percentage points included inflation effects that were offset by the favorable impact from various initiatives, such as those to improve pricing precision, risk selection and loss experience related to claims and loss control practices.
commercial lines reserve development on prior accident years of $123 million in 2023 continued to net to a favorable amount and provided a larger benefit than the $76 million recognized in 2022. the $47 million net increase in 2023, compared with 2022, included $28 million and $11 million from our commercial auto and commercial property lines of business, respectively. most of our commercial lines net favorable reserve development on prior accident years recognized during 2023 occurred in our workers' compensation and commercial property lines of business. favorable development recognized during 2022 was mostly from our workers' compensation and commercial property lines of business and during 2021 it was mostly from our commercial casualty, commercial property and workers' compensation lines of business. as discussed in critical accounting estimates, property casualty insurance loss and loss expense reserves, stable historical paid loss patterns are a key assumption used to make projections necessary for estimating ibnr reserves. development by accident year and other trends for commercial lines loss and loss expenses and the related ratios are further discussed in liquidity and capital resources, property casualty insurance development of estimated reserves by accident year.

in 2023, total large losses incurred increased by $73 million, or 33%, net of reinsurance. the corresponding 2023 ratio increased 1.3 percentage points, compared with 2022. the 2023 increase on a dollar basis was primarily due to an increase of $71 million for our commercial property line of business. in 2022, total large losses incurred and the corresponding ratio were lower than in 2021, largely due to lower amounts of large losses for our workers' compensation and commercial property lines of business. our analysis indicated no unexpected concentration of these losses and reserve increases by geographic region, policy inception, agency or field marketing territory. we believe the inherent volatility of aggregate loss experience for our portfolio of larger policies is greater than that of our portfolio of smaller policies, and we continue to monitor the volatility in addition to general inflationary trends in loss costs.

commercial lines commission expenses as a percent of earned premiums decreased slightly in 2023, compared with 2022. the ratio for 2022 decreased compared with 2021, reflecting a decrease in the ratio for profit-sharing commissions for agencies. in 2023, other underwriting expenses as a percent of earned premiums increased, compared with 2022, as earned premiums rose at a slower pace than other underwriting expenses. in 2022, other underwriting expenses as a percent of earned premiums decreased, compared with 2021, reflecting ongoing expense management efforts and premium growth outpacing growth in expenses.

reserve development performance highlights for the personal lines insurance segment include:
•premiums - earned premiums and net written premiums continued to grow in 2023, due to increases in new business written premiums and renewal written premiums that included higher average pricing and a higher level of insured exposures. renewal written premiums rose $356 million, or 22%, in 2023, compared with 2022, while new business written premiums rose $120 million, or 41%. cincinnati private clientsm net written premiums, included in the personal lines insurance segment, rose $338 million, or 37%, to approximately $1.257 billion in 2023, representing 54.6% of the segment's 2023 net written premiums. cincinnati private client net written premiums included excess and surplus lines homeowner policies with premiums totaling $109 million in 2023 and $63 million in 2022.
•combined ratio - the 2023 combined ratio increased by 1.2 percentage points, compared with 2022, including a 3.7 percentage-point increase in the ratio for catastrophe losses. development on prior accident years' loss and loss expense reserves before catastrophes during 2023 matched 2022. the 2023 combined ratio improved by 2.3 points due to a lower ratio for current accident year loss and loss expenses before catastrophe losses, compared with 2022. that ratio improvement included an increase of 2.2 points for the ibnr portion and a decrease of 4.5 points for the case incurred portion. price increases and other underwriting efforts have helped to offset losses that have elevated significantly since 2021 due to inflation effects, as earned premiums in 2023 grew faster than those losses and loss expenses.
when estimating the ultimate cost of total loss and loss expenses, we consider many factors, including trends for inflation, historical paid and reported losses, large loss activity and other data or information for the industry or our company. elevated inflation since 2021 has resulted in higher losses and loss expenses as costs have increased cincinnati financial corporation - 2023 10-k - page 74
significantly to repair damaged autos or homes that we insure, in addition to higher losses for liability coverages for some of our lines of business. due to increased uncertainty regarding ultimate losses, we intend to remain prudent in reserving for estimated ultimate losses until longer-term loss cost trends become more clear.
we have increased our pricing precision and implemented numerous rate increases in recent years to improve our personal lines insurance segment results. in addition, we have made greater use of higher minimum loss deductibles and enhanced our property inspection processes to verify condition and insurance to value. we have worked to improve our geographic diversification by expanding our personal lines operation to several states less prone to catastrophes.
our personal lines statutory combined ratio was 98.3% in 2023, compared with 97.7% in 2022 and 93.5% in 2021. the contribution of catastrophe losses to our personal lines statutory combined ratio was 15.1 percentage points in 2023, 11.4 percentage points in 2022 and 13.7 percentage points in 2021.

personal lines insurance is a strategic component of our overall relationship with most of our agencies and is an important component of our agencies' relationships with their clients. we believe agents recommend our personal insurance products to their clients who seek to balance quality and price and who are attracted by our superior claims service and the benefits of our package approach. we also believe our continuing efforts to improve pricing precision are helping us attract and retain more of our agencies' preferred business, while also obtaining higher rates for more thinly priced business.
the 22% increase in agency renewal written premiums in 2023 included the effect of various rate changes. we estimate that premium rates for our personal auto line of business increased at an average of approximately 10% during 2023, with some individual policies experiencing lower or higher rate changes based on enhanced pricing precision enabled by predictive models that consider characteristics of specific risks. for our homeowner line of business, we estimate that rate increases during 2023 averaged near the high end of the mid-single-digit range. similar to our personal auto line of business, that average varied widely by state, and some individual policies experienced lower or higher rate changes based on pricing precision and current rate level indications that helped determine appropriate premium rates.
the 22% increase in agency renewal written premiums in 2023 also included a higher level of insured exposures and other factors such as changes in policy deductibles or mix of business. part of the insured exposure increase reflects our response to inflation effects that increase the cost of building materials to repair damaged homes.
personal lines new business written premiums grew by $120 million, or 41%, during 2023, compared with 2022, including approximately $42 million from cincinnati private client policies and $78 million from middle-market policies. we believe we maintained underwriting and pricing discipline across all personal lines markets as we expanded use of enhanced pricing precision tools. some of what we report as new business came from accounts that were not new to our agents. we believe our agents' seasoned accounts tend to be priced more accurately than business that may be less familiar to them.
other written premiums primarily consist of premiums that are ceded to reinsurers and lower our net written premiums. an increase in ceded premiums reduced net written premium growth by $8 million in 2023.

personal lines insurance loss and loss expenses loss and loss expenses include both net paid losses and reserve changes for unpaid losses as well as the associated loss expenses. most of the incurred losses and loss expenses shown in the personal lines insurance segment three-year highlights table are for the respective current accident years, with reserve development on prior accident years shown separately. since approximately two-thirds of our personal lines current accident year incurred losses and loss expenses represent net paid amounts, the remaining one-third represents reserves for our estimate of ultimate losses and loss expenses. these reserves develop over time, and we re-estimate previously reported reserves as we learn more about the development on the related claims. the table below illustrates that development. for example, the 72.7% accident year 2022 loss and loss expense ratio reported as of december 31, 2022, developed favorably by 2.7 percentage points to 70.0% due to claims settling for less than previously estimated, or due to updated reserve estimates for unpaid claims, as of december 31, 2023. accident years 2022 and 2021 for the personal lines insurance segment have both developed favorably, as indicated by the progression over time for the ratios in the table.

catastrophe losses, as discussed in consolidated property casualty insurance results, explain some of the movement in the current accident year loss and loss expense ratio for accident year 2023, compared with accident year 2022. catastrophe losses added 17.3 percentage points in 2023, 14.0 points in 2022 and 14.2 points in 2021 to the respective personal lines current accident year loss and loss expense ratios in the table above. personal lines catastrophe losses for 2023 resulted in a ratio higher than our 10.6% 10-year annual average for personal lines. personal lines catastrophe losses are inherently volatile, as discussed above and in consolidated property casualty insurance results.
the 56.4% ratio for current accident year loss and loss expenses before catastrophe losses for 2023 decreased 2.3 percentage points compared with the 58.7% accident year 2022 ratio measured as of december 31, 2022. the decrease included a decrease in large losses incurred, described below, and the corresponding ratios for new losses above $2 million, with a 0.8 percentage-point decrease in the 2023 ratio. other contributions included inflation effects that were offset by the favorable impact from various initiatives, such as those to improve pricing precision, risk selection and loss experience related to claims and loss control practices.
personal lines loss and loss expense reserve development on prior accident years recognized in 2023 was favorable by $64 million, in aggregate, compared with $61 million in 2022. the 2023 net favorable reserve development included $53 million for our homeowner line of business and $15 million for our personal auto line of business. the 2022 net favorable reserve development included $54 million for our homeowner line of business. as discussed in critical accounting estimates, property casualty insurance loss and loss expense reserves, stable historical paid loss patterns are a key assumption used to make projections necessary for estimating ibnr reserves. development by accident year and other trends for personal lines loss and loss expenses and the related ratios are further discussed in liquidity and capital resources, property casualty insurance development of estimated reserves by accident year.

in 2023, personal lines total large losses incurred increased by $2 million, or 2%, net of reinsurance. the corresponding 2023 ratio decreased 0.8 percentage points, compared with 2022. the 2023 increase was primarily due to a higher amount for our homeowner line of business. in 2022, total large losses increased, compared with 2021, primarily due to higher amounts for both our homeowner line of business and umbrella coverage in our other personal line of business. our analysis indicated no unexpected concentration of these losses and reserve increases by risk category, geographic region, policy inception, agency or field marketing territory. we believe the inherent volatility of aggregate loss experience for our portfolio of larger policies is greater than that of our portfolio of smaller policies, and we continue to monitor the volatility in addition to general inflationary trends in loss costs.

personal lines commission expense as a percent of earned premiums decreased slightly in 2023, compared with 2022, as earned premiums rose at a faster pace than commission expenses. the ratio for 2022 increased compared with 2021, primarily due to an increase in commissions for agencies other than profit-sharing commissions. in both 2023 and 2022, other underwriting expenses as a percent of earned premiums matched the prior year, reflecting ongoing expense management efforts, as the pace of premium growth was in line with growth in other expenses.

personal lines insurance outlook the u.s. property casualty industry continued to experience challenges in 2023, including elevated inflation, increasing loss costs and pricing pressures as insurers pursued rate adequacy. our response continues to include rate increases, pricing precision for individual risks and use of inflation factors that respond to higher costs to repair property. we believe we can continue to profitably grow premiums in our personal lines insurance segment through new agency appointments and an ongoing focus on diversification of product and geography. we serve middle market, mass affluent and high net worth clients, helping us grow across the u.s. and spreading our catastrophe risk. drivers of profitable growth for our cincinnati private client business also include selectively using non-admitted insurance property forms and rates in certain catastrophe-prone states and geographies.
our high net worth initiative, along with various other actions to improve performance in our personal lines insurance segment, is discussed in greater detail in personal lines insurance results and also in item 1, our business and our strategy, strategic initiatives and our segments, personal lines insurance segment.

reserve development our excess and surplus lines insurance segment includes results of the cincinnati specialty underwriters insurance company and csu producer resources inc. performance highlights for this segment include:
•premiums - earned premiums and net written premiums continued to grow during 2023, including higher renewal written premiums that included average renewal estimated price increases in the high-single-digit range. new business written premiums rose 30% in 2023, compared with 2022, and also contributed significantly to premium growth.
•combined ratio - the combined ratio increased by 0.2 percentage points in 2023, driven by an increase underwriting expenses. approximately 91% of our 2023 earned premiums for the excess and surplus lines insurance segment provided commercial casualty coverages for various insured liability claims that have experienced higher losses reflecting elevated inflation. due to uncertainty regarding ultimate losses, we intend to remain prudent in reserving for estimated ultimate losses until longer-term loss cost trends become more clear. the 2023 ratio for current accident year loss and loss expenses before catastrophe losses was 0.2 percentage points higher, compared with the 65.7% accident year 2022 ratio measured as of december 31, 2022, including an increase of 5.7 points for the ibnr portion and a decrease of 5.5 points for the case incurred portion. the 2023 ratio for prior accident year loss and loss expenses before catastrophe losses was slightly more favorable than in 2022. in 2022, the ratio for current accident year loss and loss expenses before catastrophe losses increased significantly, reflecting incurred losses and loss expenses for excess and surplus lines commercial casualty coverages of $302 million in 2022 that increased $69 million or 30%, compared with 2021, while earned premiums rose 23%.

the $36 million increase in 2023 renewal premiums largely reflected higher renewal pricing. average renewal estimated price increases were in the high-single-digit range during 2023. we measure average changes in excess and surplus lines renewal pricing as the rate of change in renewal premium for the new policy period compared with the premium for the expiring policy period, assuming no change in the level of insured exposures or policy coverage between those periods for respective policies.
new business written premiums in 2023 grew by $41 million, or 30%, compared with 2022, as we continued to carefully underwrite each policy in a highly competitive market. other written premiums in 2023 reduced net written premium growth by $9 million more than in 2022 and are primarily premiums that are ceded to reinsurers and therefore reduce our net written premiums.
excess and surplus lines loss and loss expenses loss and loss expenses include both net paid losses and reserve changes for unpaid losses, as well as the associated loss expenses. the majority of the total incurred losses and loss expenses shown above in the three-year highlights table are for the respective current accident years, with reserve development on prior accident years shown separately. since less than 20% of our excess and surplus lines current accident year incurred losses and loss expenses represents net paid amounts, a large majority represents reserves for our estimate of unpaid losses and loss expenses. these reserves develop over time, and we update our estimates of previously reported reserves as we learn more about the development on the related claims. the table below illustrates that development. for example, the 66.7% accident year 2022 loss and loss expense ratio reported as of december 31, 2022, developed favorably by 3.4 percentage points to 63.3% due to claims settling for less than previously estimated, or due to updated reserve estimates for unpaid claims, as of december 31, 2023. accident year 2021 for this segment developed unfavorably by less than $1 million during 2023, after developing unfavorably during 2022, as indicated by the progression over time of the ratios in the table.

catastrophe losses, as discussed in consolidated property casualty insurance results, explain some of the movement among components of the current accident year loss and loss expense ratio for accident year 2023, compared with 2022. catastrophe losses added 0.7 percentage points in 2023, 1.0 percentage point in 2022 and 0.6 percentage points in 2021 to the respective excess and surplus lines current accident year loss and loss expense ratios in the table above.
the 65.9% ratio for current accident year loss and loss expenses before catastrophe losses for 2023 increased by 0.2 percentage points compared with the 65.7% accident year 2022 ratio measured as of december 31, 2022. the increase included a 0.4 percentage-point decrease in the ratio for current accident year losses of $2 million or more per claim, shown in the table below.

excess and surplus lines reserve development on prior accident years was a net favorable $11 million for 2023 and $9 million for 2022. the net favorable amount for 2023 was primarily for accident year 2022 and was due primarily to lower-than-anticipated loss emergence on known claims.
we believe the loss and loss expense reserves for our excess and surplus lines business are adequate. the amount of outstanding reserves for our excess and surplus lines operation can be seen in a table in liquidity and capital resources, property casualty loss and loss expense obligations and reserves. one indication of how long it takes for most of the outstanding reserves to be settled is to measure outstanding reserves by accident year at different points in time, using item 8, note 4 of the consolidated financial statements. for example, for accident years 2016, 2015 and 2014, in aggregate, after subtracting cumulative paid amounts from incurred amounts at december 31, 2016, reserves for estimated unpaid losses, plus the portion of loss expenses known as alae, equaled $193 million. for those same accident years, at december 31, 2023, the reserve estimate for the remaining unpaid amount equaled $11 million. as discussed in critical accounting estimates, property casualty insurance loss and loss expense reserves, stable historical paid loss patterns are a key assumption used to make projections necessary for estimating ibnr reserves. the inherent uncertainty in estimating reserves is discussed in liquidity and capital resources, property casualty insurance loss and loss expense obligations and reserves. development trends by accident year are further discussed in property casualty insurance development of estimated reserves by accident year.

in 2023, total large losses decreased by $4 million, net of reinsurance. the ratio for 2023 large losses as a percent of earned premiums decreased by 0.7 percentage points, compared with 2022. that ratio for 2022 increased by 0.4 points, compared with 2021. our analysis indicated no unexpected concentration of these losses and reserve increases by risk category, geographic region, policy inception, agency or field marketing territory. we believe the inherent volatility of aggregate loss experience for our portfolio of larger policies is greater than that of our portfolio of smaller policies, and we continue to monitor the volatility in addition to general inflationary trends in loss costs.

excess and surplus lines commission expense as a percent of earned premiums for 2023 increased compared with 2022, including increases in the ratios for reinsurance commissions and profit-sharing commissions for agencies. the ratio for 2022 decreased compared with 2021, largely due to a decrease in the ratio for profit-sharing commissions for agencies. the ratio for other underwriting expenses increased slightly in 2023 and decreased in 2022, and continued to reflect ongoing expense management efforts and changes in the pace of premium growth.
excess and surplus lines insurance outlook the excess and surplus lines market is expected to see the magnitude of rate increases moderate for risks that are casualty-driven, according to industry publications. for property risks involving catastrophe exposures, premium rates in the foreseeable future are expected to be firm. new business opportunities are expected to increase as standard market insurance companies continue to re-underwrite business they previously took from the excess and surplus lines market and as larger excess and surplus lines companies re-underwrite their business with an emphasis on underwriting profitability.
industry reports continue to suggest that there are opportunities for profitability and growth through greater use of technology. technology and data are also being used by excess and surplus lines insurance companies to identify new exposures in emerging businesses that need insurance protection or other value-added services.
as we continue to execute our strategy of providing superior service, we expect another year of profitable growth for our excess and surplus lines insurance segment despite challenging market conditions. our experienced excess and surplus lines underwriters in the field intend to carefully select and price risks, providing prompt delivery of insurance quotes and policies, as they work with other local field associates who provide outstanding claims and loss control service while also handling standard lines business for their assigned agencies. these local representatives are supported by headquarters underwriters and claims managers who specialize in excess and surplus lines.

performance highlights for the life insurance segment include:
•revenues - earned premiums increased 4% for the year 2023, as shown in the table below that includes details by major line of business. our largest life insurance product line, term life insurance, rose 3%. net in-force policy face amounts rose 2% to $82.361 billion at year-end 2023 from $80.482 billion at year-end 2022 and $77.493 billion at year-end 2021.
•profitability - our life insurance segment typically reports a smaller profit compared with the life insurance subsidiary because profits from investment income spreads are included in our investments segment results. we include only investment income credited to contract holders (including interest assumed in life insurance policy reserve calculations) in life insurance segment results. a profit of $41 million for our life insurance segment in 2023, compared with $27 million in 2022, was primarily due to increased earned premiums and fee revenues along with favorable mortality experience. a profit of $27 million in 2022 compared with $12 million in 2021 was primarily due to more favorable impacts from the unlocking of interest rate and other actuarial assumptions.
earned premiums increased $12 million in 2023, primarily due to a $7 million increase in term life insurance earned premiums, as shown in the table below.

products we market include term, whole and universal life insurance and also fixed annuities. in addition, we offer term and whole life insurance to employees at their worksite. these products provide our property casualty agency force with excellent cross-serving opportunities for both commercial and personal accounts.
over the past several years, we have worked to maintain a portfolio of simple, yet competitive, products. our product development efforts emphasize death benefit protection and guarantees. distribution expansion within our property casualty insurance agencies remains a high priority. our 37 life field marketing representatives work in partnership with our property casualty field marketing representatives. approximately 61% of our term and other life insurance product premiums were generated through our property casualty insurance agency relationships.
life insurance segment expenses consist principally of:
•contract holders' benefits incurred (net of investment interest credited to contract holders), related to traditional life and interest-sensitive products, accounted for 78.4% of 2023 total benefits and expenses compared with 78.3% in 2022 and 79.8% in 2021. total contract holders' benefits increased slightly in 2023, compared with 2022, largely due to less favorable impacts from the unlocking of interest rate and other actuarial assumptions. total contract holder benefits decreased in 2022 compared with 2021 due to more favorable unlocking impacts.
cincinnati financial corporation - 2023 10-k - page 83
mortality experience was more favorable in 2023, compared with 2022, and net death claims were below our mortality projections.
•underwriting expenses incurred, net of deferred acquisition costs, accounted for 21.6% of 2023 total benefits and expenses compared with 21.7% in 2022 and 20.2% in 2021. expenses in 2023 increased 4%, compared with 4% growth in earned premiums. expenses in 2022 increased 6%, compared with 2% growth in earned premiums. the 2023 increase in underwriting expenses, compared with the same period a year ago, was largely due to higher general insurance expense levels and increased amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs. the 2022 increase in underwriting expenses was largely due to the same factors as impacted the 2023 increase.
life insurance segment profitability depends largely on premium levels, the adequacy of product pricing, underwriting skill and operating efficiencies. this segment's results include only investment interest credited to contract holders (interest assumed in life insurance policy reserve calculations). the remaining investment income is reported in the investments segment results. the life investment portfolio is managed to earn target spreads between earned investment rates on general account assets and rates credited to policyholders. we consider the value of assets under management and investment income for the life investment portfolio as key performance indicators for the life insurance segment. we seek to maintain a competitive advantage with respect to benefits paid and reserve increases by consistently achieving better than average claims experience due to skilled underwriting.
we recognize that assets under management, capital appreciation and investment income are integral to evaluation of the success of the life insurance segment because of the long duration of life products. on a basis that includes investment income and investment gains or losses from life insurance-related invested assets, our life insurance subsidiary reported net income of $75 million in 2023, compared with $65 million in 2022 and $66 million in 2021. the life insurance subsidiary portfolio had after-tax net investment losses of $7 million in 2023 and $2 million in 2022 and after-tax net investment gains of $8 million in 2021. investment gains and losses are discussed under investments results. we exclude most of our life insurance company investment income from investments segment results.
life insurance outlook we believe the life insurance market remains attractive. with life insurance ownership still low compared to historical levels, we will see more opportunities for growth as our property casualty agency footprint continues to expand. our expertise with large face amount cases has allowed us to increase our average premium and face amount per policy. as more of our agencies uncover business insurance opportunities, we expect this trend to continue.
merger and acquisition activity in the independent agency channel can disrupt our ability to get consistent life insurance sales from affected agency relationships. we counter this by following the property casualty lead in assigning a local field representative to every relationship, and a sales leader to every national account. we are confident that our focus on building and strengthening these relationships will continue to lead to long-term profitable growth in the years ahead, despite any short-term disruptions.
the rising interest rate environment has benefited us. the higher yields available in the fixed income market have allowed us to reinvest securities at attractive rates, boosting our investment income. we will be paying close attention to any signals the federal reserve may send regarding the potential for rate cuts in 2024. a decision to significantly lower the overnight lending rate would likely lead to lower investment income for us over time.

•investment income - pretax investment income grew $113 million, or 14%, in 2023, due to increases from both interest income and dividends. interest income grew 18% in 2023, compared with 2022, as net purchases of fixed-maturity securities in recent years and higher average yields for bonds are working to generally offset effects of the low interest rate environment for several years prior to 2022. dividend income grew 3% in 2023, reflecting dividend rates that generally have increased, although more slowly than in prior years, minor asset allocation adjustments in our equity portfolio and net purchases of equity securities from available funds. pretax investment income rose 9% in 2022, including increases in interest and dividend income. average yields in the investment income table below are based on the average invested asset and cash amounts indicated in the table using fixed-maturity securities valued at amortized cost and all other securities at fair value.
•investment gains and losses - we reported an investment gain in 2023 and 2021, primarily due to favorable changes in fair values of equity securities even though we continue to hold the securities or as otherwise required by gaap. we reported an investment loss in 2022, due to unfavorable changes in fair values of equity securities.
we believe it is useful to analyze our overall investment performance by using total investment return over several years. total investment return considers changes in unrealized gains and losses that are not included in net income, in addition to net investment income and investment gains and losses that are included in net income. changes in unrealized gains and losses shown in the table below include other invested assets. considering total investment gains and losses over several years helps evaluate performance since gains and losses may experience typical variability during shorter periods of time.
cincinnati financial corporation - 2023 10-k - page 85
the table below shows total return based on assumptions that simplify cash flow timing that is commonly used in total return measures. this simplified calculation uses data shown in our consolidated financial statements or notes to those statements. added to invested asset amounts from our consolidated balance sheets are 50% of annual amounts pertaining to invested asset categories included in net cash used in investing activities from our consolidated statements of cash flows. the cash flow amounts are reduced by net gains from investment portfolio securities sales or called bonds, with the net result reduced by 50% to represent estimated new cash invested during each respective year. all new cash is assumed to be invested at the midpoint of the year.
total investment return of 9.9% in 2023 was significantly more than the negative 9.2% return in 2022. the 2023 contribution from the investment income component was enhanced by the net favorable effect of the investment gains and losses components. comparing contributions for 2023 with 2022, investment income rose $113 million, investment gains increased by $2.594 billion and the invested assets net change in unrealized gains and losses increased by $1.916 billion. the base component of the return calculation, annual average invested assets, was down 8% in 2023. for 2022 compared with 2021, total investment return of negative 9.2% in 2022 was significantly less than the positive return of 13.1% in 2021, as the 2022 contribution from the investment income component was offset by the net unfavorable effect of the investment gains and losses components. the base component of the return calculation, annual average invested assets, increased 14% in 2022.

investment income the primary drivers of investment income are highlighted below, followed by additional details of our investment results.
•interest income increased by $90 million, or 18%, in 2023, compared with 2022. the average fixed-maturity pretax yield increased by 34 basis points in addition to a larger fixed-maturity portfolio that rose 8% on an average amortized cost basis. interest income in 2022 increased by $33 million, compared with 2021, when that yield decreased by less than 1 basis point while the portfolio rose 7% on an amortized cost basis.
•dividend income rose $7 million, or 3%, in 2023, after rising 12% in 2022. the increases include dividend rates that generally have increased and minor asset allocation adjustments in our equity portfolio. an increase in funds invested in that portfolio during both 2023 and 2022 also favorably affected dividend income.

in 2023, we continued to invest available cash flow in both fixed income and equity securities in a manner that we believe balances current income needs with longer-term invested asset growth goals. as bonds in our generally laddered portfolio mature or are called over the near term, we reinvest with a balanced approach, keeping in mind our long-term strategy and pursuing attractive risk-adjusted after-tax yields. while our bond portfolio more than covers our insurance reserve liabilities, we believe our diversified common stock portfolio of mainly blue chip, dividend-paying companies represents one of our best investment opportunities for the long term. we continually perform fundamental analysis of both industry and company-specific opportunities as well as the potential impact from changes in the interest rate environment and the potential for elevated inflation.

total investment gains and losses investment gains and losses are recognized on the sales of investments, for certain changes in fair values of securities even though we continue to hold the securities or as otherwise required by gaap. the change in fair value for equity securities still held is reported in net income, as disclosed in note 1, summary of significant accounting policies. total investment gains and losses in 2023 included $1.168 billion of net gains from the recognition of fair value changes of equity securities still held that prior to 2018 would have been reported in other comprehensive income (oci) instead of net income. change in unrealized gains or losses for fixed-maturity securities are included as a component of oci. accounting requirements for the allowance for credit losses and impairment charges for write-downs of impaired securities in the fixed-maturity portfolio are disclosed in item 8, note 1, summary of significant accounting policies. the factors we consider when evaluating impairments are also discussed in critical accounting estimates, asset impairment.
the timing of gains or losses from sales can have a material effect on results in any given period. however, such gains or losses usually have little, if any, effect on total shareholders' equity because most equity and fixed-maturity investments are carried at fair value.
as appropriate, we buy, hold or sell both fixed-maturity and equity securities on an ongoing basis to help achieve our portfolio objectives. we generally purchase fixed-maturity securities with the intention to hold until maturity. if they no longer meet our investment criteria, they are divested. sales of fixed-maturity securities are usually due to a change in credit fundamentals. pretax total investment gains in 2023 and 2021 were largely due to favorable changes in fair values of equity securities, even though we continue to hold the securities, as shown in the table below. in 2022, the pretax total investment loss was due to unfavorable changes in fair values of equity securities and a net unfavorable change in unrealized gains or losses for fixed-maturity securities. additional information about investment gains or losses is included in item 8, note 2 of the consolidated financial statements.
the table below summarizes total investment gains and losses, before taxes.

investments outlook the pace and magnitude of federal reserve actions in 2023 softened as many of the economic data points (except labor measures) showed a slowdown from 2022 levels. credit spreads tightened but the 10-year treasury yield remained unchanged year over year. a late year-end rally led to positive returns across most asset classes.
we continued to take advantage of interest rates that were higher than rates from maturing bonds during 2023 but maintained a balanced approach to our allocation between bonds and stocks. we will continue our focus on near-term income generation with an eye to long-term book value growth within the framework of our corporate liquidity as well as adherence to insurance department regulations and rating agency commentary. we discuss our portfolio strategies in item 1, our segments, investments segment.

other total revenues in 2023 and 2022 for our other operations increased, compared with the respective prior-year periods, primarily due to higher earned premiums from cincinnati re and cincinnati global in total. other also includes noninvestment operations of the parent company and its commercial leasing and financial services subsidiary, cfc investment company. total expenses for other decreased in 2023 but increased in 2022, with the change for both years primarily due to losses and loss expenses and underwriting expenses from cincinnati re and cincinnati global.

taxes we had a $433 million income tax expense in 2023, compared with an income tax benefit of $207 million in 2022 and income tax expense of $730 million in 2021. the corporate effective tax rate for 2023 was 19.0% compared with 29.8% in 2022 and 19.7% in 2021.
the changes in our effective tax rate between periods were primarily due to large changes in our net investment gains and losses included in income for the periods, and changes in underwriting income and investment income.
historically, we have pursued a strategy of investing some portion of cash flow in tax-advantaged, fixed-maturity securities and some in equity securities to minimize our overall tax liability and maximize after-tax earnings. see item 1, our segments, fixed-maturity securities investments, for further discussion on municipal bond purchases in our fixed-maturity investment portfolio.
for tax years after 2017, for our property casualty insurance subsidiaries, approximately 75% of interest from tax-advantaged, fixed-maturity investments and approximately 40% of dividends from qualified equities are exempt from federal tax after applying proration. for our noninsurance companies, the dividend received deduction exempts 50% of dividends from qualified equities. our life insurance company does not own tax-advantaged, fixed-maturity investments or equities subject to the dividend received deduction.
our effective tax rate reconciliation is found in item 8, note 11 of the consolidated financial statements.

liquidity and capital resources we seek to maintain prudent levels of liquidity and financial strength for the protection of our policyholders, creditors and shareholders. we manage liquidity at two levels to meet the short- and long-term cash requirements of business obligations and growth needs. the first is the liquidity of the parent company. the second is the liquidity of our lead insurance subsidiary. management of liquidity at both levels is essential because each has different funding needs and sources, and each is subject to certain regulatory guidelines and requirements.
in addition to our historically positive operating cash flow to meet the needs of operations, we have the ability to slow investing activities if such need arises or to sell a portion of our high-quality, liquid investment portfolio. we also have additional capacity to borrow on our revolving short-term line of credit, as described further below.
parent company liquidity at december 31, 2023, the parent company had $4.858 billion in cash and marketable securities, providing strong liquidity to fund cash outflows, as needed. the parent company's primary sources of cash inflows are dividends from our lead insurance subsidiary, investment income and sale proceeds from investments. the parent company's cash outflows are primarily interest and principal payments on long- and short-term debt, dividends to shareholders, common stock repurchases, deposits at lloyd's and general operating expenses. to support our shareholders' dividend payment, we could use subsidiary dividends, our line of credit or sell a portion of our marketable securities.
the table below shows a summary, by the direct cash flow method, of the major sources and uses of cash flow of the parent company.

use of liquidity for share repurchases are discretionary depending on cash availability and capital management decisions. in addition, the subsidiaries have the discretion to pay dividends to the parent company. cincinnati global is required to maintain certain capital funding requirements with lloyd's, which the parent company may deposit on its behalf. these funding requirements may fluctuate based on the profitability of cincinnati global and syndicate solvency capital requirements as set by lloyd's, which may result in return of funds on deposit. other than share repurchases and funding at lloyd's, the majority of expenditures for the parent company have been consistent during the last three years, and we expect future expenditures to remain stable.

insurance subsidiary liquidity the parent company's lead insurance subsidiary largely represents the operations of the property casualty segments. the primary sources of cash inflows are collection of premiums, investment income, maturity of fixed-income securities and sale proceeds from investments. property casualty insurance premiums generally are received before losses are paid under the policies purchased with those premiums. cash outflows are primarily loss and loss expenses, commissions, salaries, taxes, operating expenses and investment purchases. over the three-year period ended december 31, 2023, premium receipts and investment income have been more than sufficient to pay claims and operating expenses. excess cash flows were partially used to pay dividends to the parent company. we are not aware of any known trends that would materially change historical cash flow results, other than fluctuations in catastrophe claims and other large losses, either individually or in aggregate.
the table below shows a summary of operating cash flow for property casualty insurance (direct method). historically, annual variation in operating cash flow has been largely related to changes in amounts of catastrophe losses.

other sources of liquidity cash in excess of operating requirements is invested in fixed-maturity and equity securities. cash generated from investment income provides an important investment contribution to cash flow and liquidity. the sale of investments could provide an additional source of liquidity at either the parent company or insurance subsidiary level, if required. in addition to possible sales of investments, proceeds of calls or maturities of fixed-maturity securities also can provide liquidity. during the five-year period beginning in 2024, fair value of $5.268 billion, or 38.2%, of our fixed-maturity portfolio is scheduled to mature. at december 31, 2023, we had $10.641 billion of common stock securities, with $4.542 billion, or 43%, held by the parent company.
financial resources of the parent company also could be made available to our insurance subsidiaries, if circumstances required it. this flexibility would include our ability to access the capital markets and short-term bank borrowings. we generally have minimized our reliance on debt financing, although we may use the line of credit to fund short-term cash needs.

long-term debt we provide details of our three long-term notes in item 8, note 8 of the consolidated financial statements. none of the notes are encumbered by rating triggers. the total principal amount of our long-term debt at december 31, 2023, was $793 million and included:
•$28 million aggregate principal amount of 6.900% senior debentures due 2028.
•$391 million aggregate principal amount of 6.920% senior debentures due 2028.
•$374 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% senior debentures due 2034.
the company's senior debt is rated investment grade by four independent rating agencies. none of the rating agencies made changes to our debt ratings in 2023. at february 23, 2024, our debt ratings from the rating agencies were: a from a.m. best, a- from fitch, a3 from moody's and bbb+ from s&p.
note payable at december 31, 2023, we had a $300 million line of credit with commercial banks, with $25 million and $50 million borrowed at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. that unsecured revolving line of credit has an accordion feature giving us the option to double the $300 million amount, under the same terms and conditions. terms and conditions of the agreement include a debt-to-total capital maximum of 35% and the agreement has no net worth covenant. it was due to expire on february 4, 2024, with the option of two one-year extensions. we exercised both one-year options to extend the term of the line of credit by two additional years to february 4, 2026.
at year-end 2023, we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement and believe we will remain in compliance. the credit agreement provides alternative interest charges based on the type of borrowing and our debt rating. on march 23, 2023, we amended our line of credit agreement to replace libor with the secured overnight financing rate (sofr) plus a credit spread adjustment.
capital resources capital resources, consisting of shareholders' equity and total debt, represent our overall financial strength to support current obligations and growth in our insurance businesses. at december 31, 2023, we had total capital of $12.913 billion. shareholders' equity was $12.098 billion, an increase of $1.536 billion, or 15%, from the prior year. our total debt was $815 million, down $24 million from a year ago. we seek to maintain a solid financial position and provide capital flexibility by keeping our ratio of debt to total capital moderate. at year-end 2023, the ratio was 6.3%, compared with 7.4% at year-end 2022.
at times we enter into letter of credit agreements to support our cincinnati re and cincinnati global operations. we have an unsecured letter of credit agreement to provide a portion of the capital needed to support cincinnati global's obligations at lloyd's. the amount of this unsecured letter of credit agreement was $94 million with no amounts drawn at december 31, 2023.
at the discretion of the board of directors, the company can return capital directly to shareholders as discussed below.
•dividends to shareholders - the ability of our company to continue paying cash dividends is subject to factors the board of directors deems relevant. while the board and management believe there is merit to sustaining the company's long record of dividend increases, our first priority is the company's financial strength. over the past 10 years, the company has paid an average of 34% of net income as dividends. through 2023, the board had increased our cash dividend for 63 consecutive years. the board's decision in january 2024 to increase the dividend demonstrated confidence in the company's strong capital, liquidity, financial flexibility and initiatives to grow earnings.
•common stock repurchase - generally, our board believes that share repurchases can help fulfill our commitment to enhancing shareholder value. consequently, the board has authorized the repurchase of outstanding shares, giving management discretion to purchase shares at reasonable prices in light of circumstances at the time of purchase. our approach has been to hold capital adequate to support future growth of our insurance operations and repurchase shares at management's discretion. repurchases are intended to offset the issuance of shares through equity compensation plans, primarily due to vesting of service-based restricted stock units of equity awards granted in the past. the amount of future repurchases may be more, or less, than the past, depending on circumstances and discretion exercised by management. our corporate code of conduct restricts repurchases during certain time periods. the details of the repurchase authorizations and activity are described in cincinnati financial corporation - 2023 10-k - page 96

item 1a. risk factors the following factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements made in this annual report on form 10-k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time. these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, funds from operations, or ffo, and prospects, which we refer to herein as a material adverse effect on us or as materially and adversely affecting us, and you should carefully consider them. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or which are currently not believed to be material may also affect our actual results. we may update these factors in our future periodic reports.
summary of risk factors the following summarizes our material risk factors. however, this summary is not intended to be a comprehensive and complete list of all risk factors identified by the company. refer to the following pages of this section for additional details regarding these summarized risk factors and other additional risk factors identified by the company.
●   conditions that adversely affect the general retail environment could materially and adversely affect us.

●   some of our properties depend on anchor stores or other large nationally recognized tenants to attract shoppers and we could be materially and adversely affected by the loss of one or more of these anchors or tenants.

●   we face potential adverse effects from tenant bankruptcies.

●   vacant space at our properties could materially and adversely affect us.

●   we may not be able to lease newly developed properties to or renew leases and relet space at existing properties with an appropriate mix of tenants or at desired rents, if at all.

●   acts of violence, civil unrest or criminal activity, actual or threatened terrorist attacks and inappropriate and unacceptable behavior by consumers at our properties could adversely affect our business operations.

●   we face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably, including e-commerce, and the evolution of consumer preferences and purchasing habits.

●   epidemics, pandemics or other public health crisis, and governmental reactions thereto, could have a significant negative impact on our and our tenants' business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity and our ability to access the capital markets, satisfy our debt service obligations and make distributions to our shareholders.

●   some of our properties are subject to potential natural or other disasters.

●   we face risks associated with climate change.

●   some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.

●   as owners of real estate, we can face liabilities for environmental contamination, and our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful.

●   we face risks associated with the acquisition, development, redevelopment and expansion of properties.

●   real estate investments are relatively illiquid.

●   simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership have elected to be taxed as reits in the united states. the failure to maintain simon's or the subsidiary reits' qualifications as reits or changes in applicable tax laws or regulations could result in adverse tax consequences.

●   if the operating partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, we will cease to qualify as a reit and suffer other adverse consequences.

11
●   complying with reit requirements might cause us to forgo otherwise attractive acquisition opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments.

●   our ownership of trss is subject to certain restrictions, and we will be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our trss are not conducted on arm's-length terms.

●   dividends payable by reits generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends, which may negatively affect the value of our shares.

●   the tax imposed on reits engaging in "prohibited transactions" may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for u.s. federal income tax purposes.

●   reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan.

●   partnership tax audit rules could have a material adverse effect on us.

●   legislative, administrative, regulatory or other actions affecting reits, including positions taken by the irs, could have a material adverse effect on us and our investors.

●   provisions in simon's charter and by-laws and in the operating partnership's partnership agreement could prevent a change of control.

●   we have a substantial debt burden that could affect our future operations.

●   the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that might affect our ability to operate freely.

●   disruption in the capital and credit markets may increase the cost of capital and may adversely affect our ability to access external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements.

●   adverse changes in our credit ratings could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms.

●   an increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt on attractive terms, or at all; our hedging interest rate protection arrangements may not effectively limit our interest rate risk.

●   we have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third parties, which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance them.

●   the operating partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint venture properties.

●   an increased focus on metrics and reporting related to environmental, social and governance ("esg") factors, may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.

●   our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract, motivate, retain and develop talented employees, and our failure to do so, including the loss of any one of our key personnel, could adversely impact our business.

●   we face risks associated with security breaches through cyber-attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our computer systems, hardware, technology infrastructure, online sites and related systems.

●   our international activities may subject us to risks that are different from or greater than those associated with our domestic operations.

risk related to tenant operations at our properties conditions that adversely affect the general retail environment could materially and adversely affect us.
our primary source of revenue is derived from retail tenants which means that we could be materially and adversely affected by conditions that materially and adversely affect the retail environment generally, including, without limitation:
●   domestic issues, such as government policies and regulations, tariffs, energy prices, market dynamics, rising interest rates, inflation and limited growth in consumer income as well as from actual or perceived changes in economic conditions, which can result from global events such as international trade disputes, a foreign debt crisis, foreign currency volatility, natural disasters, war, such as the war in ukraine and the conflict in israel, gaza and surrounding areas, epidemics and pandemics, the fear of spread of contagious diseases, civil unrest and terrorism;

12
●   levels of consumer spending, changes in consumer confidence, income levels, and fluctuations in seasonal spending in the united states and internationally;

●   supply chain disruptions and labor shortages;

●   consumers avoiding in-person shopping generally, or at certain properties, due to a heightened level of concern for safety in public places, whether due to consumer perception of increased risk of criminal activity and civil unrest, including acts of terrorism, riots, random acts of violence, mass shootings, organized retail crime or inappropriate or unacceptable behavior of other patrons, or due to heightened sensitivity to risks associated with transmission of disease, as occurred during the covid-19 pandemic;

●   consumer perceptions of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of our properties;

●   the impact on our retail tenants and demand for retail space at our properties from the increasing use of the internet by retailers and consumers;

●   the creditworthiness of our retail tenants and the availability of new creditworthy tenants and the related impact on our occupancy levels and lease income;

●   local real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of, or reduction in demand for, retail space or retail goods, decreases in rental rates and declines in real estate values;

●   the willingness of retailers to lease space in our properties at attractive rents, or at all;

●   changes in regional and local economies, which may be affected by increased rates of unemployment, increased foreclosures, higher taxes, decreased tourism, industry slowdowns, adverse weather conditions, and other factors;

●   increased operating costs and capital expenditures, whether from acquisitions, developments, redevelopments, replacing tenants or otherwise;

●   reductions in international travel and tourism, resulting in fewer international retail consumers;

●   changes in government policies and applicable laws and regulations, including tax, environmental, safety and zoning and political inefficiencies; and

●   epidemics, pandemics or other public health crises, like the covid-19 pandemic, and the governmental reaction thereto.

to the extent that any or a portion of these conditions occur, they are likely to impact the retail industry, our retail tenants, the emergence of new tenants, our own investments in certain retailers and brands, the demand for retail space, market rents and rent growth, the vacancy levels at our properties, the value of our properties, which could directly or indirectly materially and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and overall asset value.
additionally, a portion of our lease income is derived from overage rents based on sales over a stated base amount that directly depend on the sales volume of our retail tenants. accordingly, declines in our tenants' sales performance could reduce the income produced by our properties. over time, declines in our tenants' sales performance can also negatively impact our ability to sign new and renewal leases at desired rents.
some of our properties depend on anchor stores or other large nationally recognized tenants to attract shoppers and we could be materially and adversely affected by the loss of one or more of these anchors or tenants.
our properties are typically anchored by department stores and other large nationally recognized tenants. certain of our anchors and other tenants have ceased their operations, downsized their brick-and-mortar presence or failed to comply with their contractual obligations to us and others.
sustained adverse pressure on the results of department stores and other national retailers may have a similarly sustained adverse impact upon our own results. certain department stores and other national retailers have experienced, and may continue to experience for the foreseeable future (given uncertainty with respect to current and future macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence levels), considerable decreases in customer traffic in their retail stores, increased competition from alternative retail options such as those accessible via the internet and other forms of pressure on their business models. as pressure on these department stores and other national retailers increases, their ability to maintain their stores, meet their obligations both to us and to their external lenders and suppliers, withstand takeover attempts or avoid bankruptcy and/or liquidation may be impaired and result in closures of their stores or their seeking of a lease modification with us. any lease modification could be unfavorable to us as the lessor and could decrease
13
current or future effective rents or expense recovery charges. certain other tenants are entitled to modify the economic or other terms of, or terminate, their existing leases with us in the event of such closures. additionally, corporate merger or consolidation activity among department stores and other national retailers typically results in the closure of duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations.
if a department store or large nationally recognized tenant were to close its stores at our properties, we may experience difficulty and delay and incur significant expense in re-tenanting the space, as well as in leasing spaces in areas adjacent to the vacant store, at attractive rates, or at all. additionally, department store or tenant closures may result in decreased customer traffic, which could lead to decreased sales at our properties. if the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to the closing of anchor stores or other national retailers, adverse economic conditions or other reasons, tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. in the event of any default by a tenant, we may not be able to fully recover, and/or may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover, amounts due to us under the terms of our leases with such parties.
we face potential adverse effects from tenant bankruptcies.
bankruptcy filings by retailers can occur regularly in the course of our operations. although we have not seen an increase in tenant bankruptcies in the last few years, in previous years a number of companies in the retail industry, including certain of our tenants, declared bankruptcy. if a tenant files for bankruptcy, the tenant may have the right to reject and terminate one or more of its leases with us, and we cannot be sure that it will affirm one or more of its leases and continue to make rental payments to us in a timely manner. a bankruptcy filing by, or relating to, one of our tenants would generally prohibit us from evicting this tenant, and bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from that tenant, or from their property, unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court. in addition, we cannot evict a tenant solely because of its bankruptcy. if a lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy, all pre-bankruptcy balances due under the lease must be paid to us in full. if a lease is rejected, the unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt tenant might be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims, and there are restrictions under bankruptcy laws that limit the amount of the claim we can make if a lease is rejected. as a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold. in addition, we may make lease modifications either pre- or post-bankruptcy for certain tenants undergoing significant financial distress in order for them to continue as a going concern. furthermore, we may be required to incur significant expense in re-tenanting the space formerly leased to the bankrupt tenant. we continually seek to re-lease vacant spaces resulting from tenant terminations. the bankruptcy of a tenant, particularly an anchor tenant or a national tenant with multiple locations, may require a substantial redevelopment of its space, the success of which cannot be assured, and may make the re-tenanting of its space difficult and costly. any such bankruptcies also make it more difficult to lease the remainder of the space at the affected property or properties. future tenant bankruptcies may strain our resources and impact our ability to successfully execute our re-leasing strategy and could materially and adversely affect us.
vacant space at our properties could materially and adversely affect us.
certain of our properties have had vacant space available for prospective tenants, and those properties may continue to experience, and other properties may commence experiencing, such oversupply in the future. among other causes, (1) in recent years there had been an increased number of bankruptcies of anchor stores and other national retailers, as well as store closures, and (2) there has been lower demand from retail tenants for space, due to certain retailers increasing their use of e-commerce websites to distribute their merchandise. as a result of the increased bargaining power of creditworthy retail tenants, there is downward pressure on our rental rates and occupancy levels, and this increased bargaining power may also result in us having to increase our spend on tenant improvements and potentially make other lease modifications in order to attract or retain tenants, any of which, in the aggregate, could materially and adversely affect us.
we may not be able to lease newly developed properties to or renew leases and relet space at existing properties with an appropriate mix of tenants or at desired rents, if at all.
we may not be able to lease new properties to an appropriate mix of tenants that generates optimal customer traffic. also, when leases for our existing properties expire, the premises may not be relet or the terms of reletting, including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than the current lease terms. tenant preferences for properties may also change over time, like recent trends towards right-sizing portfolios, repositioning space and locations and pursuing new store concepts, and our properties may no longer align with such preferences. if we fail to identify and secure the right blend of tenants at our newly developed and existing properties that offer diversified categories and uses, such as retail, specialty entertainment, restaurants, and health and wellness, and that keep up with evolving customer preferences, our properties may not appeal to the communities they serve. if we elect to pursue a "mixed use"
14
redevelopment we expose ourselves to risks associated with each non-retail use (e.g., office, residential, hotel and entertainment), and the performance of our retail tenants in such properties may be negatively impacted by delays in opening and/or the performance of such non-retail uses. additionally, an oversupply of space in the trade areas in which our properties operate could reduce market rents, negatively impacting the terms upon which we lease our properties. to the extent that our leasing goals are not achieved, we could be materially and adversely affected.
acts of violence, civil unrest or criminal activity, actual or threatened terrorist attacks and inappropriate and unacceptable behavior by consumers at our properties could adversely affect our business operations.
because our properties are open to the public, they are exposed to risks related to acts of violence, civil unrest and criminal activity as well as actual or threatened terrorist attacks that may be beyond our control or ability to prevent, and recently there has been an increased risk of organized retail crime and physical violence, the severity and frequency of which varies by market and location. if any of these incidents were to occur, the relevant property could face material damage physically and reputationally, and the revenue generated by such property could be negatively impacted. consumers may also perceive a heightened threat of these risks due to increased crime in certain markets and negative media attention. concern around safety risk may impact the willingness of consumers, tenants and tenants' employees to shop and/or work at our properties, which could result in decreased consumer foot traffic and decreased sales at our properties, directly and indirectly impacting our revenue and overall asset value.
we face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably, including e-commerce, and the evolution of consumer preferences and purchasing habits.
our properties compete with other forms of retailing such as pure online retail websites as well as other types of retail properties such as single user freestanding discounters (costco, walmart and target). in addition, many of our tenants are omni-channel retailers who also distribute their products through online sales and provide options to consumers like buy online pick up in store, buy online ship to store or buy online return to store. our business currently is predominantly reliant on consumer demand for shopping at physical stores, and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in adapting our business to evolving consumer purchasing habits. the increased popularity of digital and mobile technologies has accelerated the transition of a percentage of market share from shopping at physical stores to web-based shopping, and the covid-19 pandemic and restrictions intended to prevent its spread significantly increased the utilization of e-commerce and may, particularly in certain market segments, accelerate the long-term penetration of pure online retail. although a brick-and-mortar presence may have a positive impact on retailers' online sales, the increased utilization of pure online shopping may lead to the closure of underperforming stores by retailers, which could impact our occupancy levels and the rates that tenants are willing to pay to lease our space. additionally, the increase in online shopping may result in certain tenants underreporting sales at our properties which may materially and adversely impact our collection of overage rent. examples may include, retailers and restaurants not reporting curbside pick-up sales or online sales fulfilled with store inventory, and tenants reducing store sales by including online returns processed in the store epidemics, pandemics or other public health crisis, and governmental reactions thereto, could have a significant negative impact on our and our tenants' business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity and our ability to access the capital markets, satisfy our debt service obligations and make distributions to our shareholders.
epidemics, pandemics or other health crises could have, a material negative impact on economic and market conditions around the world and an adverse impact on economic activity in retail real estate, as occurred during the height of the covid-19 pandemic. governments and other authorities could respond to epidemics, pandemics or other health crises, by imposing or re-imposing measures intended to control the spread of disease, including restrictions on freedom of movement, group gatherings and business operations such as travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantines, stay-at-home, shelter-in-place orders, density limitations and social distancing measures. although we cannot determine the severity of any such measures in the future, which depend on the government's recognition of the negative impacts on local communities and infrastructure resulting from future mandates and associated government responses, any restrictions could negatively impact us, our tenants and consumer behavior.
demand for retail space and the profitability of our properties depends, in part, on the ability and willingness of tenants to enter into and perform obligations under leases, and the willingness of customers to visit our properties. even without strict governmental restrictions, such as those put in place during the covid-19 pandemic, the willingness of consumers to visit our properties may be reduced and our tenants' businesses adversely affected, based upon many factors, including local transmission rates of disease, the development, availability, distribution, effectiveness and acceptance of existing and new vaccines, the effectiveness and availability of cures or treatments, and overall sensitivity to risks associated with the transmission of diseases. in addition, some of our properties are located at or within a close
15
proximity to tourist destinations, and these properties and our tenants' businesses may be heavily and adversely impacted by reductions in travel and tourism resulting from travel bans or restrictions and general concern regarding the risk of travel, as was the case during the covid-19 pandemic.
additionally, the impact of epidemics, pandemics or other public health crises, and governmental reactions thereto, on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and make distributions to our shareholders could depend on additional factors, including:
●   the financial condition and viability of our tenants, and their ability or willingness to pay rent in full;

●   state, local, federal and industry-initiated tenant relief efforts that may adversely affect landlords, including us, and their ability to collect rent and/or enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent;

●   the increased popularity and further utilization of e-commerce;

●   our ability to renew leases or re-lease available space in our properties on favorable terms or at all, including as a result of a deterioration in the economic and market conditions in the markets in which we own properties or due to restrictions intended to prevent the spread of disease, including any government mandated closures of businesses that frustrate our leasing activities;

●   a severe and prolonged disruption and instability in the global financial markets, including the debt and equity capital markets, which may affect our or our tenants' ability to access capital necessary to fund our or their respective business operations or repay, refinance or renew maturing liabilities on a timely basis, on attractive terms, or at all and may adversely affect the valuation of financial assets and liabilities, any of which could affect our and our tenants' ability to meet liquidity and capital expenditure requirements;

●   a refusal or failure of one or more lenders under our existing or future credit facilities to fund their respective financing commitment to us may affect our ability to access capital necessary to fund our business operations and to meet our liquidity and capital expenditure requirements;

●   a reduction in the cash flows generated by our properties and the values of our properties that could result in impairments or limit our ability to dispose of them at attractive prices or obtain debt financing secured by our properties;

●   the complete or partial closure of one or more of our tenants' manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in our tenants' supply chains from local and international suppliers and/or delays in the delivery of our tenants' inventory, any of which could reduce or eliminate our tenants' sales, cause the temporary closure of our tenants' businesses, and/or result in their bankruptcy or insolvency;

●   a negative impact on consumer discretionary spending caused by high unemployment levels, reduced economic activity or a severe or prolonged recession;

●   our and our tenants' ability to manage our respective businesses to the extent our and their management or personnel (including on-site employees) are impacted in significant numbers or are otherwise not willing, available or allowed to conduct work, including any impact on our tenants' ability to deliver timely information to us that is necessary for us to make effective decisions; and

●   our and our tenants' ability to ensure business continuity in the event our or our tenants' continuity of operations plan is (i) not effective or improperly implemented or deployed or (ii) compromised due to increased cyber and remote access activity during such epidemic, pandemic or other public health crisis.

to the extent any of these risks and uncertainties adversely impact us in the ways described above or otherwise, they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein.
risks related to real estate holdings and operations some of our properties are subject to potential natural or other disasters.
a material amount of our share of noi is derived in states such as florida, california, texas and new york which are located in areas which may be subject to a higher risk of natural disasters such as tornados, floods, blizzards, hurricanes, heatwaves, fires, drought, earthquakes or tsunamis. the occurrence of natural disasters at any of our properties, which could occur more frequently, increase in intensity and may become more volatile in light of climate change, can adversely impact operations and development/redevelopment projects at our properties, increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties, increase future property insurance costs and negatively impact our tenants and the tenant demand for lease space. if insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or our
16
insurance is not adequate to cover losses from these events, we could be materially and adversely affected. additionally, the occurrence of natural disasters at our corporate headquarters or one of our satellite offices could affect our ability to carry on business functions that are critical to our financial and operational viability.
we face risks associated with climate change.
due to changes in weather patterns caused by climate change, our properties in certain markets including florida, california, texas and new york, where we derive a material amount of our share of noi could experience increases in storm intensity, storm frequency and be impacted by rising sea levels. over time, climate change could result in population migration or volatile or decreased demand for retail space at certain of our properties or, in extreme cases, our inability to operate the properties at all. climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) insurance on favorable terms, or at all, increasing the cost of energy at our properties or requiring us to spend funds to repair and protect our properties against such risks.
some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.
we maintain insurance coverage with third-party carriers who provide a portion of the coverage for specific layers of potential losses, including commercial general liability, fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties in the united states as well as cyber coverage. the initial portion of coverage, excess of policy deductibles, not provided by third-party carriers is either insured through our wholly-owned captive insurance company or other financial arrangements controlled by us. a third party carrier has, in turn, agreed to provide, if required, evidence of coverage for this layer of losses under the terms and conditions of the carrier's policy. a similar policy either written through our captive insurance company or other financial arrangements controlled by us also provides initial coverage for property insurance and certain windstorm risks at the properties located in coastal windstorm locations.
there are some types of losses, including lease and other contract claims, which generally are not insured or are subject to large deductibles. additionally, insurance costs and availability may be impacted in the future by factors outside of our control, like inflationary pressures or cybersecurity events. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue it could generate but may remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligation related to the property.
we currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties in the united states on an "all risk" basis in the amount of up to $1 billion. despite the existence of this insurance coverage, any threatened or actual terrorist attacks where we operate could materially and adversely affect our property values, revenues, consumer traffic and tenant sales.
as owners of real estate, we can face liabilities for environmental contamination, and our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful.
many of our properties contain, or at one time contained, asbestos containing materials or underground storage tanks (primarily related to auto service center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment), and as a result we may be subject to regulatory action in connection with u.s. federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to hazardous or toxic substances. we may also be held liable to third parties for personal injury or property damage incurred by the parties in connection with any such substances. the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances, and related liabilities, may be substantial and could materially and adversely affect us. the presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remediate the related contamination, may also adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or redevelop a property or to borrow money using a property as collateral.
although we believe that our portfolio is in substantial compliance with u.s. federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances, this belief is based on limited testing. nearly all of our u.s. properties have been subjected to phase i or similar environmental audits. these environmental audits have not revealed, nor are we aware of, any environmental liability that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. however, we cannot assure you that:
●   previous environmental studies with respect to the portfolio reveal all potential environmental liabilities;

●   any previous owner, occupant or tenant of a property did not create any material environmental condition not known to us;

●   the current environmental condition of the portfolio will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by other unrelated third parties; or

●   future uses or conditions (including, without limitation, changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof) will not result in environmental liabilities.

17
we face risks associated with the acquisition, development, redevelopment and expansion of properties.
we regularly acquire and develop new properties and redevelop and expand existing properties, and these activities are subject to various risks. acquisition or construction costs of a project may be higher than projected, potentially making the project unfeasible or unprofitable, and development, redevelopment or expansions may take considerably longer than expected, delaying the commencement and amount of income from the property. these risks, and the potential impact thereof, may be exacerbated by the volume and complexity of such activity, as well as inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. we may not be successful in pursuing acquisition, development or redevelopment/expansion opportunities. in addition, newly acquired, developed or redeveloped/expanded properties may not perform as well as expected, impacting our anticipated return on investment. we are subject to other risks in connection with any acquisition, development and redevelopment/expansion activities, including the following:
●   we may not be able to obtain financing or to refinance loans on favorable terms, or at all;

●   we may be unable to obtain zoning, occupancy or other governmental approvals;

●   occupancy rates and rents may not meet our projections and the project may not be accretive;

●   we may need the consent of third parties such as department stores, anchor tenants, mortgage lenders and joint venture partners, and those consents may be withheld;

●   development, redevelopment or expansions may fail to appeal to the demographics of the communities they are intended to serve, including a failure to incorporate the appropriate blend of available space for tenants;

●   we may not be able to integrate an acquisition into our existing operations successfully; and

●   acquisitions of new properties will expose us to the liabilities of those properties, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of the acquisition.

if a development or redevelopment/expansion project is unsuccessful, either because it is not meeting our expectations when operational or was not completed according to the project planning, we could lose our investment in the project. further, if we guarantee the property's financing, our loss could exceed our investment in the project.
in the event that these risks were realized at the same time at multiple properties, we could be materially and adversely affected.
real estate investments are relatively illiquid.
our properties represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets. these investments are relatively illiquid. as a result, our ability to sell one or more of our properties or investments in real estate in response to any changes in economic, industry, or other conditions may be limited. the real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability and terms of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand for space, that are beyond our control. if we want to sell a property, we cannot assure you that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period, or at all, or that the sales price of a property will be attractive at the relevant time or exceed the carrying value of our investment. moreover, if a property is mortgaged, we may not be able to obtain a release of the lien on that property without the payment of the associated debt and/or a substantial prepayment penalty, which could restrict our ability to dispose of the property, even though the sale might otherwise be desirable.
risks relating to income taxes and reit rules simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership have elected to be taxed as reits in the united states. the failure to maintain simon's or the subsidiary reits' qualifications as reits or changes in applicable tax laws or regulations could result in adverse tax consequences.
in the united states, simon and certain subsidiaries of the operating partnership have elected to be taxed as reits under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code. we believe that simon and these subsidiaries, or the subsidiary reits, have been organized and have operated in a manner which allows them to qualify for taxation as reits under the internal revenue code. we intend to continue to operate in this manner. however, qualification and taxation as reits depend upon the ability of simon and the subsidiary reits to satisfy several requirements (some of which are outside our control), including tests related to our annual operating results, asset diversification, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership. the various reit qualification tests required by the internal revenue code are highly technical and complex. accordingly, there can be no assurance that simon or any of the subsidiary reits has operated in accordance with these requirements or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit.
18
if simon or any of the subsidiary reits fail to comply with those provisions, simon or any such subsidiary reit may be subject to monetary penalties or ultimately to possible disqualification as reits. if such events occur, and if available relief provisions do not apply:
●   simon or any such subsidiary will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing taxable income;

●   simon or any such subsidiary will be subject to corporate-level income tax on taxable income at the corporate rate;

●   simon may be subject to the one-percent excise tax on stock repurchases imposed by the 2022 inflation reduction act;

●   simon or any such subsidiary reit could be subject to a federal alternative minimum tax for taxable years prior to 2018 or for taxable years commencing after december 31, 2022; and

●   unless entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions, simon or any such subsidiary will also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost.

any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for, among other things, our operations and distributions to stockholders. in addition, if simon fails to qualify as a reit, it will not be required to make distributions to our stockholders. moreover, a failure by any subsidiary reit could also cause simon to fail to qualify as a reit, and the same adverse consequences would apply to such subsidiary reit and its stockholders. failure by simon or any of the subsidiary reits to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, which could materially and adversely affect us. additionally, we are subject to certain income-based taxes, both domestically and internationally, and other taxes, including state and local taxes, franchise taxes, and withholding taxes on dividends from certain of our international investments. we currently follow local tax laws and regulations in various domestic and international jurisdictions. should these laws or regulations change, the amount of taxes we pay may increase accordingly.
if the operating partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, we will cease to qualify as a reit and suffer other adverse consequences.
we believe that the operating partnership is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. as a partnership, the operating partnership is not subject to federal income tax on its income. instead, each of its partners, including us, is allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, such partner's share of its income. we cannot assure you that the internal revenue service, or the irs, will not challenge the status of the operating partnership, or any other subsidiary partnership or limited liability company in which we own an interest, as a disregarded entity or partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. if the irs were successful in treating the operating partnership or any such other subsidiary as an entity taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to reits and, accordingly, we would likely cease to qualify as a reit. also, the failure of the operating partnership or any subsidiary partnerships or limited liability company to qualify as a disregarded entity or partnership for applicable income tax purposes could cause it to become subject to federal and state corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners or members, including us.
complying with reit requirements might cause us to forgo otherwise attractive acquisition opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments.
to qualify to be taxed as reits for u.s. federal income tax purposes, simon and the subsidiary reits must ensure that, at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of their respective assets consist of cash, cash items, government securities and "real estate assets" (as defined in the internal revenue code), including certain mortgage loans and securities. the remainder of their respective investments (other than government securities, qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a taxable reit subsidiary, or trs) generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer.
additionally, in general, no more than 5% of the value of simon's and the subsidiary reits' total assets (other than government securities, qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a trs) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, and no more than 20% of the value of their respective total assets can be represented by securities of one or more trss. if simon or any of the subsidiary reits fails to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, simon or any such subsidiary reit must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing its reit qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. as a
19
result, we might be required to liquidate or forgo otherwise attractive investments. these actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to equity holders. moreover, if simon or the subsidiary reits are compelled to liquidate their investments to meet any of the asset, income or distribution tests, or to repay obligations to lenders, simon or such subsidiaries may be unable to comply with one or more of the requirements applicable to reits or may be subject to a 100% tax on any resulting gain if such sales constitute prohibited transactions.
in addition to the asset tests set forth above, to qualify to be taxed as reits, simon and the subsidiary reits must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of their respective income, the amounts they distribute to equity holders and the ownership of their respective shares. we might be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the source-of-income or asset-diversification requirements for qualifying as reits. thus, compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments.
our ownership of trss is subject to certain restrictions, and we will be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our trss are not conducted on arm's-length terms.
we own securities in trss and may acquire securities in additional trss in the future. a trs is a corporation other than a reit in which a reit directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such reit to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary. if a trs owns more than 35% of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation, such other corporation will also be treated as a trs. other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities, a trs may generally engage in any business, including the provision of customary or non-customary services to tenants of its parent reit. a trs is subject to federal income tax as a regular c corporation. in addition, a 100% excise tax will be imposed on certain transactions between a trs and its parent reit that are not conducted on an arm's-length basis.
a reit's ownership of securities of a trs is not subject to the 5% or 10% asset tests applicable to reits. not more than 25% of the value of simon's or any subsidiary reit's total assets may be represented by securities (including securities of trss), other than those securities includable in the 75% asset test, and not more than 20% of the value of our total assets or the assets of any subsidiary reit may be represented by securities of trss. we anticipate that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of any trs and other nonqualifying assets that simon or each such subsidiary reit owns will be less than 25% (or, in the case of securities of trss, 20%) of the value of simon's or such subsidiary's total assets, and we will monitor the value of these investments to ensure compliance with applicable ownership limitations. in addition, we intend to structure transactions with any trss that we own to ensure that they are entered into on arm's-length terms to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above. there can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the above limitations or to avoid application of the 100% excise tax discussed above.
dividends payable by reits generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends, which may negatively affect the value of our shares.
income from "qualified dividends" payable to u.s. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates are generally subject to tax at preferential rates, currently at a maximum federal rate of 20%. dividends payable by reits, however, generally are not eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income. u.s. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally may deduct up to 20% of the ordinary dividends (e.g., dividends not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income) received from a reit for taxable years beginning before january 1, 2026. although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by reits (generally to 29.6% assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37% maximum rate), such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income. accordingly, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-reit corporations that pay dividends, which could materially and adversely affect the value of the shares of reits, including the per share trading price of our common stock.
the tax imposed on reits engaging in "prohibited transactions" may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for u.s. federal income tax purposes.
a reit's net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% penalty tax. in general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business, such characterization is a factual determination (unless a sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbors), and no guarantee can be given that the irs would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors.
20
reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan.
in order for simon and the subsidiary reits to qualify to be taxed as reits, and assuming that certain other requirements are also satisfied, each generally must distribute at least 90% of its reit taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains, to their respective equity holders each year. to the extent that simon or any such subsidiary reit satisfies this distribution requirement and qualifies for taxation as a reit, but distributes less than 100% of its reit taxable income, simon or such subsidiary will be subject to u.s. federal corporate income tax on its undistributed net taxable income and could be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that is distributed to equity holders in a calendar year is less than the minimum required distribution amount. we intend to make distributions to the equity holders of simon and the subsidiary reits to comply with the reit requirements of the internal revenue code.
from time to time, simon and the subsidiary reits might generate taxable income greater than their respective cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves, or required debt or amortization payments. if the applicable reit does not have other funds available in these situations, it could be required to access capital on unfavorable terms (the receipt of which cannot be assured), sell assets at disadvantageous prices, distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt, or make taxable distributions of capital stock or debt securities to make distributions sufficient to enable it to pay out enough of its reit taxable income to satisfy the reit distribution requirement and avoid corporate income tax and the 4% excise tax in a particular year. these alternatives could increase costs or reduce our equity. further, amounts distributed will not be available to fund the growth of our business. thus, compliance with the reit requirements may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan.
partnership tax audit rules could have a material adverse effect on us.
under the rules applicable to u.s. federal income tax audits of partnerships, subject to certain exceptions, any audit adjustment to items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit of a partnership (and any partner's distributive share thereof) is determined, and taxes, interest, or penalties attributable thereto could be assessed and collected, at the partnership level. absent available elections, it is possible that a partnership in which we directly or indirectly invest could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties as a result of an audit adjustment, and we, as a direct or indirect partner of these partnerships, could be required to bear the economic burden of those taxes, interest, and penalties even though simon and the subsidiary reits, as reits, may not otherwise have been required to pay additional corporate-level taxes had they owned the assets of the partnership directly. the partnership tax audit rules apply to the operating partnership and its subsidiaries that are classified as partnerships for u.s. federal income tax purposes. there can be no assurance that these rules will not have a material adverse effect on us.
legislative, administrative, regulatory or other actions affecting reits, including positions taken by the irs, could have a material adverse effect on us and our investors.
the rules dealing with u.s. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, and by the irs and the u.s. department of the treasury, or the treasury. changes to the tax laws or interpretations thereof by the irs and the treasury, with or without retroactive application, could materially and adversely affect us and our investors. we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors and us. new legislation, treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect the ability of simon and the subsidiary reits to qualify to be taxed as reits and/or the u.s. federal income tax consequences to us and our investors of such qualification. moreover, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, could change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit.
provisions in simon's charter and by-laws and in the operating partnership's partnership agreement could prevent a change of control.
simon's charter contains a general restriction on the accumulation of shares in excess of 8% of its capital stock. the charter permits the members of the simon family and related persons to own up to 18% of simon's capital stock. ownership for such purpose is determined based on the number of outstanding shares, voting power or value controlled, whichever is most restrictive. simon's board of directors may, by majority vote, permit exceptions to those levels in circumstances where it determines that simon's ability to qualify as a reit will not be jeopardized. these restrictions on ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interest of simon's stockholders or the operating partnership's unitholders or preferred unitholders. other
21
provisions of simon's charter and by-laws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control even if some of simon's stockholders or the operating partnership's unitholders or preferred unitholders deem such a change to be in their best interests. these include provisions preventing holders of simon's common stock from acting by written consent and requiring that up to four directors in the aggregate may be elected by holders of class b common stock. in addition, certain provisions of the operating partnership's partnership agreement could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control. these include a provision requiring the consent of a majority in interest of units in order for simon, as general partner of the operating partnership, to, among other matters, engage in a merger transaction or sell all or substantially all of its assets.
risks related to indebtedness and the financial markets we have a substantial debt burden that could affect our future operations.
as of december 31, 2023, our consolidated mortgages and unsecured indebtedness, excluding related premium, discount and debt issuance costs, totaled $26.2 billion. as a result of this indebtedness, we are required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows for debt service, including selected repayment at scheduled maturities, which limits our ability to use those cash flows to fund the growth of our business. we are also subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flows from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service or that we will be able to refinance such indebtedness on acceptable terms, or at all. our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments at the applicable property, such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants, cause a reduction in the income from the property. our indebtedness could also have other adverse consequences on us, including reducing our access to capital or increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic, industry and market conditions. in addition, if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value. if any of the foregoing occurs, we could be materially and adversely affected.
the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that might affect our ability to operate freely.
we have a variety of unsecured debt, including the credit facilities, senior unsecured notes and commercial paper, and secured property level debt. certain of the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain covenants, including, among other things, limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured indebtedness, sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and certain acquisitions. in addition, certain of the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain financial covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios, including certain coverage ratios. these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous to us. in addition, our ability to comply with these provisions might be affected by events beyond our control. failure to comply with any of our financing covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate the related indebtedness as well as other of our indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
disruption in the capital and credit markets may increase the cost of capital and may adversely affect our ability to access external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements.
we depend on external financings, principally debt financings, to fund the growth of our business, execute on our business model, and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt. our access to financing depends on our credit ratings, the willingness of lending institutions and other debt investors to grant credit to us and conditions in the capital markets in general, which can impact both our cost of capital and, to a lesser degree, our ability to access capital. an economic recession may cause extreme volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets. we rely upon the credit facilities as sources of funding for numerous transactions. our access to these funds is dependent upon the ability of each of the participants to the credit facilities to meet their funding commitments to us. when markets are volatile, access to capital and credit markets could be disrupted over an extended period of time and one or more financial institutions may not have the available capital to meet their previous commitments to us. the failure of one or more participants to the credit facilities to meet their funding commitments to us could have a material adverse effect on us, including as a result of making it difficult to obtain the financing we may need for future growth and/or meeting our debt service requirements. additionally, a high interest rate environment, as we are currently experiencing, and which the company believes will continue in 2024, could prevent us from accessing capital at attractive interest rates, which could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt at maturity as well as our ability to fund development and/or opportunistic acquisition activities. we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for the future growth of our business, execution on our business model or to meet our debt service requirements, or that a sufficient amount of financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.
22
adverse changes in our credit ratings could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms.
the operating partnership's outstanding senior unsecured notes, the credit facilities, the commercial paper program, and simon's preferred stock are periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. the credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, financial condition and prospects, and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to us and our industry and the economic outlook in general. our credit ratings can affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financing we obtain. since we depend primarily on debt financing to fund the growth of our business, an adverse change in our credit ratings, including actual changes and changes in outlook, or even the initiation of a review of our credit ratings that could result in an adverse change, could have a material adverse effect on us.
an increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt on attractive terms, or at all; our hedging interest rate protection arrangements may not effectively limit our interest rate risk.
as of december 31, 2023, we had approximately $328.0 million of outstanding consolidated indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates, and we may incur more variable rate indebtedness in the future. when interest rates increase, then so does the interest costs on our unhedged variable rate debt, which could adversely affect our cash flows and our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or significantly increase our future interest expense.
we selectively manage our exposure to interest rate risk by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap all or a portion of our variable rate debt. in addition, we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and other terms are appropriate. our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful.
our use of interest rate hedging arrangements to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations or that we could be required to fund our contractual payment obligations under such arrangements in relatively large amounts or on short notice. developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. termination of these hedging agreements typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs.
risks related to joint ventures we have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third parties, which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance them.
as of december 31, 2023, we owned interests in 100 income-producing properties with other parties. of those, 19 properties are included in our consolidated financial statements. we apply the equity method of accounting to the other 81 properties (the joint venture properties) and our investments in klépierre (a publicly traded, paris-based real estate company), the taubman realty group, llc, or trg, and jamestown, as well as our investments in certain entities involved in retail operations, such as j.c. penney and sparc group; intellectual property and licensing venture, such as authentic brands group, llc, or abg; and an e-commerce venture rue gilt groupe, or rgg, (collectively, our other platform investments). we serve as general partner or property manager for 51 of these 81 joint venture properties; however, certain major decisions, such as approving the operating budget and selling, refinancing, and redeveloping the properties, require the consent of the other owners. of the joint venture properties for which we do not serve as general partner or property manager, 24 are in our international joint ventures. these international properties are managed locally by joint ventures in which we share control of the properties with our partner. the other owners have participating rights that we consider substantive for purposes of determining control over the joint venture properties' assets. the remaining joint venture properties, klépierre, trg, jamestown, and our joint ventures with abg, j.c. penney, rgg, and sparc group are managed by third parties.
these investments, and other future similar investments, could involve risks that would not be present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners or other owners might become bankrupt, suffer a deterioration in their creditworthiness, or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. if one of our partners or other owners in these investments were to become bankrupt, we may be precluded from taking certain actions regarding our investments without prior court approval, which at a minimum may delay the actions we would or might want to take. additionally, partners or other owners could have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our own business interests or goals, and could be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives.
23
these investments, and other future similar investments, also have the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions, such as a sale, financing or development, because neither we nor our partner or other owner has full control over the partnership or joint venture. disputes between us and partners or other owners might result in litigation or arbitration that could increase our expenses and prevent simon's officers and/or directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business. consequently, actions by, or disputes with, partners or other owners might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk. in addition, we risk the possibility of being liable for the actions of our partners or other owners.
the operating partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint venture properties.
joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by a mortgage on the joint venture property, which is non-recourse to us. nevertheless, the joint venture's failure to satisfy its debt obligations could result in the loss of our investment therein. as of december 31, 2023, the operating partnership guaranteed joint venture-related mortgage indebtedness of $139.2 million. a default by a joint venture under its debt obligations would expose us to liability under a guaranty. we may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions (generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests), advances or partner loans, although such fundings are not typically required contractually or otherwise.
general risk factors an increased focus on metrics and reporting related to environmental, social and governance ("esg") factors, may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.
investors and other stakeholders have become more focused on understanding how companies address a variety of esg factors. as they evaluate investment decisions, many investors look not only at company disclosures but also to esg rating systems that have been developed by third parties to allow esg comparisons among companies. although we participate in a number of these ratings systems, we do not participate in all such systems. the criteria used in these ratings systems may conflict and change frequently, and we cannot predict how these third parties will score us, nor can we have any assurance that they score us accurately or other companies accurately or that other companies have provided them with accurate data. we supplement our participation in ratings systems with published disclosures of our esg activities, but some investors may desire other disclosures that we do not provide. in addition, the sec is currently evaluating potential rule making that could mandate additional esg disclosure and impose other requirements on us. in addition, some of the domestic and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could mandate additional esg disclosure and impose additional requirements on us. for example, in october 2023, california passed two bills that require certain companies that do business in california to disclose their ghg emissions and climate-related financial risks starting in 2026. failure to participate in certain of the third party ratings systems, failure to score well in those ratings systems, failure to provide certain esg disclosures, or unfavorable comparisons in these areas to other companies could result in reputational harm when employees, investors, partners and tenants are making employment, investment and business choices, and could cause certain investors to be unwilling to invest in our stock which could adversely impact our stock price.
our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract, motivate, retain and develop talented employees, and our failure to do so, including the loss of any one of our key personnel, could adversely impact our business.
the success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees, including our ceo, who operate without the existence of employment agreements. many of our senior executives have extensive experience and strong reputations in the real estate industry, which aid us in identifying opportunities and negotiating with tenants. our ability to attract, motivate and retain talented employees, and develop talent internally, could significantly impact our future performance. competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive management team and other key employees or that we will be able to attract, motivate, retain and/or develop other highly qualified individuals for these positions in the future. additionally, the compensation and benefits packages we may need to offer to remain competitive for these individuals could increase the cost of replacement and retention. losing any one or more of these persons could adversely affect our business, disrupt short-term operational performance, diminish our opportunities and weaken our relationships with lenders, business partners, existing and prospective tenants and others, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
we face risks associated with security breaches through cyber-attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our computer systems, hardware, technology infrastructure, online sites and related systems.
we rely on computer systems, hardware, software, technology infrastructure and online sites for the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations (collectively, "it systems") and, in some cases, our it
24
systems may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. we own and manage some of these it systems but also rely on third parties for a range of it systems and related products and services. and we collect, maintain and process confidential, sensitive, and proprietary information about investors, tenants, partners, businesses, our employees, and others, including personally identifiable information, as well as confidential, sensitive, and proprietary information belonging to our business such as trade secrets (collectively, "confidential information"). we face numerous and evolving cybersecurity risks that threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our it systems and confidential information. the risk of a cyber incident has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks have increased globally, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, information service interruptions and cyber terrorists, opportunistic hackers and hacktivists, as well as through diverse attack vectors, such as social engineering/phishing, malware (including ransomware), malfeasance by insiders, human or technological error, and as a result of bugs, misconfigurations or exploited vulnerabilities in software or hardware. techniques used in cyber incidents evolve frequently, may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world and be difficult to detect and may not be recognized until launched against a target. accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. for example, unauthorized parties, whether within or outside the company, may disrupt or gain access to our it systems, those of our tenants, or those of other third parties with whom we do business, through human error, misfeasance, fraud, trickery, or other forms of deceit, including break-ins, use of stolen credentials, social engineering, phishing, computer viruses or other malicious codes, and similar means of unauthorized and destructive tampering.
the risk of a security breach or significant disruption has generally increased due to our increased reliance on technology, a rise in the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks globally, and the permanent nature of remote work as business travel has resumed and people now routinely work remotely outside of normal business hours. a breach or significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our systems, including our primary website, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers, tenants and revenues, generate third party claims, cause operational disruption, result in the unintended and/or unauthorized public disclosure or the misappropriation of confidential information, and require us to incur significant expenses to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues. we may not be able to recover these expenses in whole or in any part from our service providers or responsible parties, or their or our insurers.
additionally, cyber-attacks perpetrated against our tenants, including unauthorized access to customers' credit card data and other confidential information, could diminish consumer confidence and spending at our tenants, or negatively impact consumer perception of shopping at our properties, all of which could materially and adversely affect us.
as have many companies, we and our third party vendors have been impacted by security incidents in the past and will likely continue to experience security incidents of varying degrees. while we do not believe these incidents have had a material impact to date, as our reliance on technology increases, so do the risks of a security incident. the occurrence of any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on us.
in addition, our processing of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, subjects us to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and industry standards governing the collection, use, storage, sharing, transmission and other processing of personal information. the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements that are subject to differing interpretations. any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with laws, regulations, policies or regulatory guidance relating to privacy or data security may result in governmental investigations and enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity and could cause our investors to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.
there can be no assurance that our cybersecurity risk management program and processes, including our policies, controls or procedures, will be fully implemented, complied with or effective in protecting our systems and information.
our international activities may subject us to risks that are different from or greater than those associated with our domestic operations.
as of december 31, 2023, we held interests in consolidated and joint venture properties that operate in austria, canada, france, italy, germany, japan, malaysia, mexico, the netherlands, south korea, spain, thailand, and the united kingdom. we also have an equity stake in klépierre, a publicly traded european real estate company which operates in 14 countries in europe, and in trg, which has an interest in regional, super-regional, and outlet malls in the united states and asia. accordingly, our operating results and the value of our international operations may be impacted by any unhedged movements in the foreign currencies in which those operations transact and in which our net investment in those international operations is held. while we occasionally enter into hedging agreements to manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates, these agreements may not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely.
25
we may pursue additional investment, ownership, development and redevelopment/expansion opportunities outside the united states. such international activities carry risks that are different from those we face with our domestic properties and operations. these risks include, but are not limited to:
●   adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies;

●   changes in foreign political and economic environments, regionally, nationally, and locally;

●   impact from international trade disputes and the associated impact on our tenants' supply chain and consumer spending levels;

●   challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, including corporate governance, operations, taxes and litigation;

●   the risk that we, our employees and/or agents could violate anti-bribery, anti-corruption and international trade laws in the u.s., such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, and certain foreign countries, such as the u.k. bribery act, which could result in criminal or civil sanctions and/or fines, negatively impact our reputation, or require us to incur significant expenses to investigate;

●   differing lending practices;

●   differences in cultures and consumer retail behavior;

●   changes in applicable laws and regulations in the united states that affect international operations;

●   changes in applicable laws and regulations in these foreign jurisdictions;

●   difficulties in managing international operations;

●   obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash; and

●   labor discord, political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism, epidemics and pandemics, including covid-19, the fear of spread of contagious diseases, supply chain disruptions or the threat of international boycotts.

our international activities represented approximately 6.4% of consolidated net income and 9.4% of our net operating income, or noi, for the year ended december 31, 2023. to the extent that we expand our international activities, the above risks could increase in significance, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that are included in this annual report on form 10-k.

we own, develop and manage premier shopping, dining, entertainment and mixed-use destinations, which consist primarily of malls, premium outlets®, and the mills®. as of december 31, 2023, we owned or held an interest in 195 income-producing properties in the united states, which consisted of 93 malls, 69 premium outlets, 14 mills, six lifestyle centers, and 13 other retail properties in 37 states and puerto rico. we also own an 84% noncontrolling interest in the taubman realty group, llc, or trg, which has an interest in 24 regional, super-regional, and outlet malls in the u.s. and asia. in addition, we have redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of anchors, big box tenants, and restaurants, underway at several properties in the north america, europe and asia. internationally, as of december 31, 2023, we had ownership in 35 premium outlets and designer outlet properties primarily located in asia, europe, and canada. as of december 31, 2023, we also owned a 22.4% equity stake in klépierre sa, or klépierre, a publicly traded, paris-based real estate company, which owns, or has an interest in, shopping centers located in 14 countries in europe. we also own investments in retail operations (j.c. penney and sparc group); an intellectual property and licensing venture (authentic brands group, llc, or abg); an e-commerce venture (rue gilt groupe, or rgg), and jamestown (a global real estate investment and management company), collectively, our other platform investments.
we generate the majority of our lease income from retail, dining, entertainment, and other tenants including consideration received from:
●   fixed minimum lease consideration and fixed common area maintenance (cam) reimbursements, and

●   variable lease consideration primarily based on tenants' sales, as well as reimbursements for real estate taxes, utilities, marketing and certain other items.

revenues of our management company, after intercompany eliminations, consist primarily of management fees that are typically based upon the revenues of the property being managed.
we invest in real estate properties to maximize total financial return which includes both operating cash flows and capital appreciation. we seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, or ffo, and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of our properties and investments. we seek to accomplish this growth through the following:
●   attracting and retaining high quality tenants and utilizing economies of scale to reduce operating expenses,

●   expanding and re-tenanting existing highly productive locations at competitive rental rates,

●   selectively acquiring or increasing our interests in high quality real estate assets or portfolios of assets,

●   generating consumer traffic in our retail properties through marketing initiatives and strategic corporate alliances, and

●   selling selective non-core assets.

59
we also grow by generating supplemental revenues from the following activities:
●   establishing our malls as leading market resource providers for retailers and other businesses and consumer-focused corporate alliances, including payment systems (such as handling fees relating to the sales of bank-issued prepaid cards), national marketing alliances, static and digital media initiatives, business development, sponsorship, and events,

●   offering property operating services to our tenants and others, including waste handling and facility services, and the provision of energy services,

●   selling or leasing land adjacent to our properties, commonly referred to as "outlots" or "outparcels," and

●   generating interest income on cash deposits and investments in loans, including those made to related entities.

we focus on high quality real estate across the retail real estate spectrum. we expand or redevelop properties to enhance profitability and market share of existing assets when we believe the investment of our capital meets our risk-reward criteria. we selectively develop new properties in markets we believe are not adequately served by existing retail outlet properties.
we routinely review and evaluate acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance our portfolio. our international strategy includes partnering with established real estate companies and financing international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk.
to support our growth, we employ a three-fold capital strategy:
●   provide the capital necessary to fund growth,

●   maintain sufficient flexibility to access capital in many forms, both public and private, including but not limited to, having in place, the operating partnership's $5.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, or the credit facility, its $3.5 billion supplemental unsecured revolving credit facility, or its supplemental facility, together, the credit facilities and its global unsecured commercial paper note program, or the commercial paper program, of $2.0 billion, or the non-u.s. dollar equivalent thereof, and

●   manage our overall financial structure in a fashion that preserves our investment grade credit ratings.

we consider ffo, net operating income, or noi, and portfolio noi to be key measures of operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, or gaap. we use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies. reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable gaap measures are included below in this discussion.
results overview diluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per unit increased $0.46 during 2023 to $6.98 as compared to $6.52 in 2022. the increase in diluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per unit was primarily attributable to:
●   improved operating performance and solid core business fundamentals in 2023, as discussed below,

●   pre-tax gains in 2023 on the disposal, exchange, or revaluation of equity interests of $362.0 million, or $0.97 per diluted share/unit, of which $204.9 million, or $0.55 per diluted share/unit, was non-cash,

●   increased lease income in 2023 of $259.2 million, or $0.69 per diluted share/unit,

●   increased other income of $99.1 million, or $0.26 per diluted share/unit, primarily due to a $59.5 million, or $0.16 per diluted share/unit, increase in distributions and other income and a $56.6 million, or $0.15 per diluted share/unit, increase in interest income, partially offset by a decrease in lease settlement income of $17.0 million, or $0.05 per diluted share/unit,

●   an unrealized favorable change in fair value of publicly traded equity instruments and derivative instrument, net of $73.1 million, or $0.20 per diluted share/unit, partially offset by

●   decreased income from unconsolidated entities of $272.3 million, or $0.73 per diluted share/unit, the majority of which is due to unfavorable year-over-year operations from other platform investments,

60
●   a non-cash gain in 2022 on the disposal, exchange, or revaluation of equity interests, net of $121.2 million, or $0.32 per diluted share/unit,

●   increased interest expense in 2023 of $93.4 million, or $0.25 per diluted share/unit, primarily due to new usd and eur bond issuances as well as increases to rates on variable rate mortgages,

●   increased other expenses in 2023 of $35.6 million, or $0.10 per diluted share/unit,

●   increased depreciation and amortization in 2023 of $34.7 million, or $0.09 per diluted share/unit, and

●   increased property operating expenses in 2023 of $25.2 million, or $0.07 per diluted share/unit.

portfolio noi increased 4.9% in 2023 as compared to 2022. average base minimum rent for u.s. malls and premium outlets increased 3.1% to $56.82 psf as of december 31, 2023, from $55.13 psf as of december 31, 2022. ending occupancy for our u.s. malls and premium outlets increased 0.9% to 95.8% as of december 31, 2023, from 94.9% as of december 31, 2022, primarily due to strong leasing demand.
our effective overall borrowing rate at december 31, 2023 on our consolidated indebtedness increased 27 basis points to 3.49% as compared to 3.22% at december 31, 2022. this increase was primarily due to an increase in the effective overall borrowing rate on variable rate debt of 198 basis points (5.91% at december 31, 2023 as compared to 3.93% at december 31, 2022) due to increasing benchmark rates, partially offset by a decrease in the amount of our variable rate debt and an increase in fixed rate debt. the weighted average years to maturity of our consolidated indebtedness was 8.1 years and 7.5 years at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
our financing activity for the year ended december 31, 2023 included:
●   the operating partnership completing on november 14, 2023, the issuance of €750.0 million senior unsecured bonds ($808.0 million u.s. dollar equivalent) with a maturity date of november 14, 2026 and a fixed interest rate of 3.50%. the bonds are exchangeable into shares of klépierre at the option of the holder of the bond at an initial common price of €27.2092. we may elect to settle the exchange with cash instead of shares. proceeds were used to repay €750.0 million ($815.4 million u.s. dollar equivalent) outstanding under the supplemental facility on november 17, 2023.

●   the operating partnership completing on november 9, 2023, the issuance of the following senior unsecured notes: $500 million with a fixed interest rate of 6.25% and $500 million with a fixed interest rate of 6.65%, with maturity dates of january 15, 2034 and january 15, 2054, respectively.

●   borrowing $180.0 million under the credit facility and subsequently unencumbering two properties,

●   completing, on june 1, 2023 the redemption at par of the operating partnership's $600 million 2.75% notes at maturity,

●   the operating partnership completing on march 8, 2023, the issuance of the following senior unsecured notes: $650 million with a fixed interest rate of 5.5% and $650 million with a fixed interest rate of 5.85%, with maturity dates of march 8, 2033 and march 8, 2053, respectively. a portion of the net proceeds were used to fund the optional redemption at par of the operating partnerships $500 million floating interest rate notes due january 2024 on march 13, 2023, and

●   amending, restating, extending, and increasing our existing $4.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility on march 14, 2023 with a new $5.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility.

ending occupancy levels and average base minimum rent per square foot. ending occupancy is the percentage of gross leasable area, or gla, which is leased as of the last day of the reporting period. we include all company owned space except for mall anchors, mall majors, mall freestanding and mall outlots in the calculation. base minimum rent per square foot is the average base minimum rent charge in effect for the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in ending occupancy.
current leasing activities during the twelve months ended december 31, 2023, we signed 1,185 new leases and 1,841 renewal leases (excluding mall anchors and majors, new development, redevelopment and leases with terms of one year or less) with a fixed minimum rent across our u.s. malls and premium outlets portfolio, comprising approximately 10.9 million square feet, of which 8.3 million square feet related to consolidated properties. during 2022, we signed 1,262 new leases and 1,517 renewal leases with a fixed minimum rent, comprising approximately 9.1 million square feet, of which 7.0 million square feet related to consolidated properties. the average annual initial base minimum rent for new leases was $66.39 per square foot in 2023 and $55.41 per square foot in 2022 with an average tenant allowance on new leases of $64.31 per square foot and $53.01 per square foot, respectively.

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or gaap, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. from time to time, we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions. in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. for a summary of our significant accounting policies, see note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
●   we, as a lessor, primarily under long-term leases, retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases. we accrue fixed lease income on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases, when we believe substantially all lease income, including the related straight-line rent receivable, is probable of collection. our assessment of collectability, primarily under long-term leases, incorporates available operational performance measures such as sales and the aging of billed amounts as well as other publicly available information with respect to our tenant's financial condition, liquidity and capital resources. when a tenant seeks to reorganize its operations through bankruptcy proceedings, we assess the collectability of receivable balances including, among other things, the timing of a tenant's bankruptcy filing and our expectations of the assumption by the tenant in bankruptcy proceeding of leases at the company's properties on substantially similar terms. in the event that we determine accrued receivables are not probable of collection, lease income will be recorded on a cash basis, with the corresponding tenant receivable and straight-line rent receivable charged as a direct write-off against lease income in the period of the change in our collectability determination.

●   we review investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis to identify and evaluate events or changes in circumstances which indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable. these circumstances include, but are not limited to, changes in a property's operational performance such as declining cash flows, occupancy or total sales per square foot, the company's intent and ability to hold the related asset, and, if applicable, the remaining time to maturity of underlying financing arrangements. we measure any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted operating income before depreciation and amortization during the anticipated holding period plus its residual value is less than the carrying value of the property. to the extent impairment has occurred, we charge to income the excess of carrying value of the property over our estimate of its fair value. we also review our investments, including investments in unconsolidated entities, to identify and evaluate whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable. we will record an impairment charge if we determine the fair value of the investments are less than their carrying value and such impairment is other-than-temporary. our evaluation of changes in economic or operating conditions and whether an impairment is other-than-temporary may include developing estimates of fair value, forecasted cash flows or operating income before depreciation and amortization. we estimate undiscounted cash flows and fair value using observable and unobservable data such as operating income, hold periods, estimated capitalization and discount rates, or relevant market multiples, leasing prospects and local market information and whether certain impairments are other-than-temporary. changes in economic and operating conditions, including changes in the financial condition of our tenants, and changes to our intent and ability to hold the related asset, that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other investments could impact the assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future charges to earnings if assumptions regarding those investments differ from actual results.

●   to maintain simon's status as a reit, we must distribute at least 90% of reit taxable income in any given year and meet certain asset and income tests. we monitor our business and transactions that may potentially impact simon's reit status. in the unlikely event that we fail to maintain simon's reit status, and available relief provisions do not apply, we would be required to pay u.s. federal income taxes at regular corporate income tax rates during the period simon did not qualify as a reit. if simon lost its reit status, it could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost unless its failure was due

63
to reasonable cause and certain other conditions were met. as a result, failing to maintain reit status would result in a significant increase in the income tax expense recorded and paid during those periods.

●   in the period of a significant acquisition of real estate, we make estimates as part of our valuation of the purchase price of asset acquisitions (including the components of excess investment in joint ventures) to the various components of the acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each component. the most significant components of our real estate valuations are typically the determination of relative fair value to the buildings as-if-vacant, land and market value of in-place leases. in the case of the fair value of buildings and fair value of land and other intangibles, our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation or amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term. in the case of the market value of in-place leases, we make our best estimates of the tenants' ability to pay rents based upon the tenants' operating performance at the property, including the competitive position of the property in its market as well as sales psf, rents psf, and overall occupancy cost for the tenants in place at the acquisition date. our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired in-place leases.

results of operations the following acquisitions, dispositions, and openings of consolidated properties affected our consolidated results in the comparative periods:

for the purposes of the following comparisons between the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 and the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, the above transactions are referred to as the property transactions. in the following discussions of our results of operations, "comparable" refers to properties we owned and operated in both years in the year to year comparisons.
year ended december 31, 2023 vs. year ended december 31, 2022

during 2023, sparc group issued equity to a third party resulting in the dilution of our ownership to 33.3% and a deemed disposal of a proportional interest of our investment. as a result, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax gain on the deemed disposal of $145.8 million. during 2023, abg completed multiple capital transactions which resulted in the dilution of our ownership and multiple deemed disposals of a proportional interest of our investment. as a result, we recognized non-cash pre-tax gains on the deemed disposals of $59.1 million. during 2023, we also recorded our share of the gain on the sale of a portion of our abg interests of $157.1 million. during 2022, we recorded a $159.0 million non-cash gain as a result of the sale to abg of all of our interests in the eddie bauer licensing venture for additional interests in abg, partially offset by a loss of $37.8 million on the revaluation or disposal of other investments.
income and other tax expense decreased $1.6 million primarily related to the 2022 eddie bauer licensing transaction noted above of $39.7 million and an overall lower tax expense on our share of operating results from our other platform investments of approximately $27.2 million, partially offset by the tax impact of the sparc and abg transactions in 2023 noted above of $69.3 million.
65
income from unconsolidated entities decreased $272.3 million primarily due to lower results of operations from our other platform investments.
during 2023, we recorded an $11.2 million loss on the disposition of certain assets by klépierre and an impairment on a joint venture property, our share of which was $8.6 million, partially offset by an $8.7 million gain on the disposition of certain assets by a joint venture investment and an $8.1 million gain on excess insurance proceeds. during 2022, we recorded a $19.9 million gain on the disposition of one unconsolidated property, a $2.1 million gain related to excess insurance proceeds and a $1.3 million gain on the disposition of certain assets by klépierre, partially offset by a $17.7 million loss primarily related to the disposition of one consolidated property.
simon's net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $21.0 million due to an increase in the net income of the operating partnership.
year ended december 31, 2022 vs. year ended december 31, 2021
lease income increased $168.5 million, of which the property transactions accounted for a $23.2 million decrease. comparable lease income increased $191.7 million, or 4.1%. total lease income increased primarily due to an increase in fixed lease income of $156.6 million primarily due to an increase in fixed minimum lease consideration, higher occupancy, and an increase in variable lease income of $11.9 million primarily related to higher consideration based on tenant sales.
total other income decreased $4.2 million, primarily due to a decrease in lease settlement income of $38.8 million, a $14.9 million gain from the sale of our interest in a multi-family residential property in 2021, and a $6.8 million non-cash dilution gain on a non-retail investment in 2021, partially offset by an $20.8 million increase in fee and other income, a $17.9 million increase related to simon brand ventures and gift card revenues, a $9.8 million increase related to land sale activity and a $7.8 million increase in interest income.
property operating expenses increased $48.4 million primarily due to the return to a more normalized operating environment following the peak of the covid pandemic.

interest expense decreased $34.5 million primarily related to the early extinguishment of nine secured loans, the disposition of three retail properties, and the refinancing of two retail properties at lower interest rates in 2021, partially offset by the issuances of euro and usd bonds and interest increases due to variable rates in 2022.
during 2021, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $51.8 million as a result of the early redemption of unsecured notes and the payoff of mortgages at nine properties.
during 2022, we recorded a $159.0 million non-cash gain as a result of the sale to abg of all of our interests in the eddie bauer licensing venture for additional interests in abg, partially offset by a loss of $37.8 million on the revaluation or disposal of other investments. during 2021, we recorded a non-cash gain of $159.8 million as a result of the sale to abg of all of our interests in the licensing ventures of forever 21 and brooks brothers for additional interests in abg and a gain on the sale of a portion of our interest in abg of $18.8 million, as discussed further in note 6.
income and other tax expense decreased $73.7 million due to the impact in 2021 on deferred tax expense as a result of the abg transaction noted above, which had a non-cash tax impact of $55.9 million, offset by the impact in 2022 on deferred tax expense of the 2022 abg transaction noted above, which had a non-cash tax impact of $39.7 million, and lower tax expense in 2022 on our share of operating results from our other platform investments.
income from unconsolidated entities decreased $134.9 million primarily due to unfavorable results of operations year over year from our other platform investments of $216.1 million, as well as the reversal in 2021 of a previously established deferred tax liability at klépierre resulting in a non-cash gain, of which our share was $118.4 million, partially offset by favorable year over year results of operations across the properties and trg in 2022.
during 2022, we recorded a $19.9 million gain on the disposition of one unconsolidated property, a $2.1 million gain related to excess insurance proceeds and a $1.3 million gain on the disposition of certain assets by klépierre, partially offset by a $17.7 million loss primarily related to the disposition of one consolidated property. during 2021, we recorded gains of $184.0 million related to the disposition of three consolidated properties, our interest in one unconsolidated property and the impact from the consolidation of one property that was previously unconsolidated, and gains of $21.2 million related to property insurance recoveries of previously depreciated assets.
simon's net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $6.2 million due to a decrease in the net income of the operating partnership.

liquidity and capital resources because we own long-lived income-producing assets, our financing strategy relies primarily on long-term fixed rate debt. floating rate debt comprised 1.1% of our total consolidated debt at december 31, 2023. we also enter into interest rate protection agreements from time to time to manage our interest rate risk. we derive most of our liquidity from positive net cash flow from operations and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities that totaled $4.2 billion in the aggregate during 2023. the credit facilities and the commercial paper program provide alternative sources of liquidity as our cash needs vary from time to time. borrowing capacity under these sources may be increased as discussed further below.
our balance of cash and cash equivalents increased $547.4 million during 2023 to $1.2 billion as of december 31, 2023 as further discussed below.
on december 31, 2023, we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of approximately $8.1 billion under the facilities, net of letters of credit of $58.6 million. for the year ended december 31, 2023, the maximum aggregate outstanding balance under the credit facilities was $1.1 billion and the weighted average outstanding balance was $962.6 million. the weighted average interest rate was 4.36% for the year ended december 31, 2023.
simon has historically had access to public equity markets and the operating partnership has historically had access to private and public, short and long-term unsecured debt markets and access to secured debt and private equity from institutional investors at the property level.
our business model and simon's status as a reit require us to regularly access the debt markets to raise funds for acquisition, development and redevelopment activity, and to refinance maturing debt. simon may also, from time to time, access the equity capital markets to accomplish our business objectives. we believe we have sufficient cash on hand and availability under the credit facilities and the commercial paper program to address our debt maturities and capital needs through 2024.
cash flows our net cash flow from operating activities and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities totaled $4.2 billion during 2023. in addition, we had net proceeds of debt from our debt financing and repayment activities of $971.3 million in 2023. these activities are further discussed below under "financing and debt." during 2023, we also:
●   paid stockholder dividends and unitholder distributions totaling approximately $2.8 billion and preferred unit distributions totaling $5.2 million,

●   funded consolidated capital expenditures of $793.3 million (including development and other costs of $156.0 million, redevelopment and expansion costs of $328.8 million, and tenant costs and other operational capital expenditures of $308.5 million),

●   funded investments in unconsolidated entities of $84.0 million,

●   funded the purchase of $1.0 billion of short-term investments,

●   funded the repurchase of $140.6 million of simon's common stock, and

●   received proceeds from the sale of equity instruments of $304.1 million.

in general, we anticipate that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating expenses, monthly debt service, recurring capital expenditures, and dividends to stockholders and/or distributions to partners necessary to maintain simon's reit qualification on a long-term basis. in addition, we expect to be able to generate or obtain capital for nonrecurring capital expenditures, such as acquisitions, major building redevelopments and expansions, as well as for scheduled principal maturities on outstanding indebtedness, from the following, however a severe and prolonged disruption and instability in the global financial markets, including the debt and equity capital markets, may affect our ability to access necessary capital:
●   excess cash generated from operating performance and working capital reserves,

●   borrowings on the credit facilities and commercial paper program,

●   additional secured or unsecured debt financing, or

●   additional equity raised in the public or private markets.

67
we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2024, and we consider these projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash. these cash flows are principally derived from rents paid by our tenants. a significant deterioration in projected cash flows from operations, could cause us to increase our reliance on available funds from the credit facilities and commercial paper program, further curtail planned capital expenditures, or seek other additional sources of financing.

mortgage debt total mortgage indebtedness was $5.2 billion and $5.5 billion at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
covenants our unsecured debt agreements contain financial covenants and other non-financial covenants. if we were to fail to comply with these covenants, after the expiration of the applicable cure periods, the debt maturity could be accelerated or other remedies could be sought by the lender, including adjustments to the applicable interest rate. as of december 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all covenants of our unsecured debt.
at december 31, 2023, our consolidated subsidiaries were the borrowers under 35 non-recourse mortgage notes secured by mortgages on 38 properties and other assets, including two separate pools of cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized mortgages encumbering a total of five properties. under these cross-default provisions, a default under any mortgage included in the cross-defaulted pool may constitute a default under all mortgages within that pool and may lead to acceleration of the indebtedness due on each property within the pool. certain of our secured debt instruments contain financial and other non-financial covenants which are specific to the properties that serve as collateral for that debt. if the applicable borrower under these non-recourse mortgage notes were to fail to comply with these covenants, the lender could accelerate the debt and enforce its rights against their collateral. at december 31, 2023, the applicable borrowers under these non-recourse mortgage notes were in compliance with all covenants where non-compliance could individually
69
or in the aggregate, giving effect to applicable cross-default provisions, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.

our off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of our investments in joint ventures which are common in the real estate industry and are described in note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. our joint ventures typically fund their cash needs through secured non-recourse debt financings obtained by and in the name of the joint venture entity. the joint venture debt is secured by a first mortgage, is without recourse to the joint venture partners, and does not represent a liability of the partners, except to the extent the partners or their affiliates expressly guarantee the joint venture debt. as of december 31, 2023, the operating partnership guaranteed joint venture-related mortgage indebtedness of $139.2 million. mortgages guaranteed by the operating partnership are secured by the property of the joint venture which could be sold in order to satisfy the outstanding obligation and which has an estimated fair value in excess of the guaranteed amount. we may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions (generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests), advances or partner loans, although such fundings are not required contractually or otherwise.
hurricane impacts during the year ended december 31, 2021, we recorded $2.1 million as business interruption income, which was recorded in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. during the year ended december 31, 2021, we also recorded a $21.0 million gain related to property insurance recovery of previously depreciated assets. this amount was recorded in (loss) gain on acquisition of controlling interest, sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interests in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
acquisitions and dispositions buy-sell, marketing rights, and other exit mechanisms are common in real estate partnership agreements. most of our partners are institutional investors who have a history of direct investment in retail real estate. we and our partners in
70
our joint venture properties may initiate these provisions (subject to any applicable lock up or similar restrictions). if we determine it is in our best interests for us to purchase the joint venture interest and we believe we have adequate liquidity to execute the purchase without hindering our cash flows, then we may initiate these provisions or elect to buy our partner's interest. if we decide to sell any of our joint venture interests, we expect to use the net proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness or to reinvest in development, redevelopment, or expansion opportunities.
acquisitions.
on june 17, 2022, we acquired an additional interest in gloucester premium outlets from a joint venture partner for $14.0 million in cash consideration, including a pro-rata share of working capital, resulting in the consolidation of this property. the property is subject to an $85.7 million 3.29% variable rate mortgage loan. we accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition and substantially all of our investment has been determined to relate to investment property.
the company sponsored, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, a special purpose acquisition corporation, or spac, named simon property group acquisition holdings, inc. on february 18, 2021 the spac announced the pricing of its initial public offering, which was consummated on february 23, 2021, and generated gross proceeds of $345.0 million. the spac was a consolidated vie which was formed for the purpose of effecting a business combination and was targeting innovative businesses that operate within simon's "live, work, play, stay, shop" ecosystem.
dispositions. we may continue to pursue the disposition of properties that no longer meet our strategic criteria or that are not a primary retail venue within their trade area.
during 2023, we disposed of our interest in one unconsolidated retail property through foreclosure in satisfaction of the $114.8 million non-recourse mortgage loan. we recognized no gain or loss in connection with this disposal.
in december 2022, the spac was liquidated and dissolved. in connection with this event, we recorded a loss of $10.2 million, representing our sponsor investment in the spac.
during 2022, we disposed of our interest in one consolidated retail property. the proceeds from this transaction were $59.0 million, resulting in a loss of $15.6 million. we also recorded a non-cash gain of $19.9 million related to the disposition of one unconsolidated retail property in satisfaction of its $99.6 million non-recourse mortgage loan. these are included in (loss) gain on acquisition of controlling interest, sale or disposal of, or recovery on, assets and interest in unconsolidated entities and impairment, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.
during 2021, we recorded net gains of $176.8 million primarily related to disposition activity which included the foreclosure of three consolidated retail properties in satisfaction of their respective $180.0 million, $120.9 million and $100.0 million non-recourse mortgage loans. we also disposed of our interest in an unconsolidated property resulting in a gain of $3.4 million.
joint venture formation activity and other investment activity during the fourth quarter of 2023, we sold a portion of our interest in abg, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $157.1 million, which is included in gain on disposal, exchange, or revaluation of equity interests, net, in the consolidated statement of operations. in connection with this transaction, we recorded tax expense of $39.3 million which is included in income and other tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. concurrently, abg completed a capital transaction resulting in the dilution of our ownership to approximately 9.6% and a deemed disposal of a proportional interest of our investment. as a result, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax gain on the deemed disposal of $10.3 million, which is included in gain on disposal, exchange, or revaluation of equity interests, net in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. this non-cash investing activity is excluded from our consolidated statement of cash flows. in connection with this transaction, we recorded deferred taxes of $2.6 million, which is included in income and other tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.
on september 7, 2023, we acquired an additional 4% ownership in trg for approximately $199.6 million by issuing 1,725,000 units in the operating partnership, bringing our noncontrolling ownership interest in trg to 84%.
during the third quarter of 2023, abg completed a capital transaction resulting in the dilution of our ownership from approximately 11.8% to approximately 11.7% and a deemed disposal of a proportional interest of our investment. as a result, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax gain on the deemed disposal of $12.4 million, which is included in gain on disposal, exchange, or revaluation of equity interests, net in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. this non-cash investing activity is excluded from our consolidated statement of cash flows. in connection with this
71

development activity we routinely incur costs related to construction for significant redevelopment and expansion projects at our properties. redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of anchors, big box tenants, and restaurants are underway at several properties in north america, europe, and asia.
construction continues on certain redevelopment and new development projects in the u.s. and internationally that are nearing completion. our share of the costs of all new development, redevelopment and expansion projects currently under construction is approximately $1,344 million. simon's share of remaining net cash funding required to complete the new development and redevelopment projects currently under construction is approximately $498 million. we expect to fund these capital projects with cash flows from operations. we seek a stabilized return on invested capital in the range of 7-10% for all of our new development, expansion and redevelopment projects.

international development activity we typically reinvest net cash flow from our international joint ventures to fund future international development activity. we believe this strategy mitigates some of the risk of our initial investment and our exposure to changes in foreign currencies. we have also funded most of our foreign investments with local currency-denominated borrowings that act as a natural hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates. our consolidated net income exposure to changes in the volatility of the euro, yen, peso, won, and other foreign currencies is not material. we expect our share of estimated committed capital for international development projects to be completed with projected delivery in 2024 or 2025 is $94 million, primarily funded through reinvested joint venture cash flow and construction loans.

non-gaap financial measures industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties in part based on performance measures such as ffo, diluted ffo per share, noi, and portfolio noi. we believe that these non-gaap measures are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of reits and provide a relevant basis for comparison among reits. we also use these measures internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio.
we determine ffo based upon the definition set forth by the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") funds from operations white paper - 2018 restatement. our main business includes acquiring, owning, operating, developing, and redeveloping real estate in conjunction with the rental of real estate. gains and losses of assets incidental to our main business are included in ffo. we determine ffo to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with gaap:
●   excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization,

●   excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items,

●   excluding gains and losses from the sale, disposal or property insurance recoveries of, or any impairment related to, depreciable retail operating properties,

●   plus the allocable portion of ffo of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and

●   all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with gaap.

you should understand that our computations of these non-gaap measures might not be comparable to similar measures reported by other reits and that these non-gaap measures:
●   do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap,

74
●   should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of operating performance, and

●   are not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.

the following schedule reconciles total ffo to consolidated net income and, for simon, diluted net income per share to diluted ffo per share.

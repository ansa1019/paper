risk factors we are dependent on the leadership of our chief executive officer and other executive officers and key employees.
the success of our business and the ability to execute our strategy are highly dependent on the efforts of mr.
zubretsky, our chief executive officer, and our other key executive officers and employees. the loss of their leadership, expertise, and experience could negatively impact our operations. our ability to replace them or any other key employee may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the healthcare industry who have the breadth and depth of skills and experience necessary to operate and lead a business such as ours. competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain, or motivate these personnel. if we are unsuccessful in recruiting, retaining, managing, and motivating such personnel, our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations could be adversely affected.
we face risks related to litigation.
we are subject to a variety of legal actions that may affect our business, including but not limited to provider claims, employment related disputes and employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, qui tam or false claims act actions, administrative matters before government agencies, tort claims, intellectual property-related litigation, and class actions of various kind. these actions or proceedings could result in substantial costs to us, require management to spend substantial time focused on litigation, result in negative media attention, and may adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. if we incur liability materially in excess of the amount for which we have insurance coverage, our profitability would suffer.
failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and stock price, and could subject us to sanctions by regulatory authorities.
a material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the past, which have subsequently been remediated. if additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, the risk of material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements may increase and we could be required to restate our financial results.
because our corporate headquarters are located in southern california, our business operations may be disrupted as a result of a major earthquake or wildfire.
our corporate headquarters are located in long beach, california. in addition, some of our health plans' claims are processed in long beach, california. southern california is exposed to a statistically greater risk of a major earthquake and wildfires than most other parts of the united states. if a major earthquake or wildfire were to strike southern california, our corporate functions and claims processing could be impaired for an unforeseen period of time. if there is a major southern california earthquake or wildfire, there can be no assurances that our disaster recovery plan will be successful or that the business operations of our health plans, including those that are remote from any such event, would not be impacted.

cybersecurity risk management, governance and risk assessment the company is committed to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information systems and the data they contain from cybersecurity threats. the company recognizes that cybersecurity is a dynamic and evolving area of risk that requires ongoing assessment, management, and oversight. the company has established a cybersecurity program (the "program") that is designed to assess, identify, manage, and mitigate material cybersecurity threats, as well as to respond to and recover from cybersecurity incidents.
cybersecurity risk management the program is based on the national institute of standards and technology ("nist") cybersecurity framework
("csf"), nist special publication 800-53, and the payment card industry standards, as applicable, and designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including hipaa and the new york department of financial services cybersecurity regulation, as applicable. this does not imply that we meet any particular technical standards, specifications, or requirements, only that we use the nist csf and payment card industry standards as guides to help us identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business. the program is aligned with the company's overall enterprise risk management system and processes and shares common methodologies, reporting channels and governance processes that apply across the enterprise risk management program to other legal, compliance, strategic, operational, and financial risk areas. control procedures are assessed regularly to confirm their effectiveness. the company undergoes an annual service organization controls ("soc") type 2 attestation report covering the performance of safeguards deployed to protect certain company systems and applications. the company maintains cybersecurity insurance providing coverage for certain costs related to security failures and specified cybersecurity-related incidents that interrupt our network or networks of our vendors, in all cases up to specified limits and subject to certain exclusions.
the company has a designated chief information security officer (the "ciso"). the program is implemented and managed by the company's executive management under the leadership of the ciso. the company contracts with third-
party service providers to support aspects of the program implementation, operations, and review of information technology operations and cybersecurity technologies. additionally, the company has retained a number of well-
established and reputable cybersecurity consultants, including forensics experts, auditors, as well as outside cybersecurity legal counsel to assist with cybersecurity matters as needed from time to time.
the company has a computer incident response team ("cirt") which is responsible for monitoring, preventing, detecting, assisting with the investigation, and responding to cybersecurity threats. the company has in place an information security incident response plan ("irp") protocol which provides an operational framework to coordinate the response to any type of cybersecurity incident affecting the company. the cirt team informs the ciso of cybersecurity threats consistent with the irp. the irp also provides the process and oversight to manage cybersecurity incidents that may arise from a third-party service provider. in addition, the irp addresses management responsibility with respect to disclosure determinations related to a cybersecurity incident and provides for audit committee and board briefings as appropriate.
the company's cybersecurity policies and procedures are reviewed by the ciso and updated at least annually. in addition, under the irp, following the resolution of a cybersecurity incident, the company will generally consider the effectiveness of the program and the irp, make adjustments as appropriate, and report to senior management and the audit committee as appropriate on these matters. the cybersecurity policies and procedures are communicated and enforced throughout the company, as well as with the third-party service providers that have access to the company's information systems or nonpublic information. cybersecurity policies and procedures are also subject to periodic review and audits by internal and external parties, such as the internal audit function, external auditors, regulators, or independent assessors. the company requires employees to undergo cybersecurity-related training, including phishing prevention training, and employees are tested regularly through phishing exercises.
governance the ciso is responsible for developing, maintaining, and enforcing the program's policies and procedures, as well as reporting on the program's performance and material cybersecurity risks to the audit committee. the ciso has the relevant expertise and authority to carry out the program's objectives and to coordinate with other key stakeholders within and outside the company. the ciso's expertise includes decades of information technology and cybersecurity as a subject matter expert, including more than a decade of executive management experience as a ciso for fortune 500 companies.

the program is overseen by the company's board of directors through its audit committee which, pursuant to its charter, assists the board with oversight of company privacy, data security, and cybersecurity matters and risks.
the audit committee meets regularly with the company's executive management, including the ciso and the chief information officer, and receives updates on the status and overall effectiveness of the program, changes to the program, relevant information technology operations, any changes in material cybersecurity risks and any significant cybersecurity incidents consistent with the irp. the audit committee also discusses with executive management the steps management has taken to monitor and mitigate privacy, data security, and cybersecurity risk exposures, the company's information governance policies and programs, and major legislative and regulatory developments that could materially impact the company's exposure regarding privacy, data security risk, and cybersecurity. the audit committee reports to the full board regarding its activities, including those related to cybersecurity. the audit committee and the board consider cybersecurity as part of the company's business strategy, financial planning, and capital allocation.
cybersecurity risk assessment the ciso is responsible for assessing and managing the company's material risks from cybersecurity threats. the company conducts regular risk assessments to identify, evaluate, and prioritize material cybersecurity risks to the company, including its health plans and state contracts, shared services and it operations, or business strategy.
the risk assessments are informed by various sources of information, such as internal and external audits, vulnerability scans, penetration tests, threat intelligence, incident reports, industry benchmarks, and accepted industry practices. the risk assessments consider the potential impact and likelihood of various cybersecurity threats, such as ransomware, malware, social engineering, third-party incidents, supply chain attacks and insider threats, and contemplates the adequacy of controls to detect, prevent, respond, and recover to reduce the possibility of an adverse material cybersecurity event. the company has in place processes to identify material risks from cybersecurity threats associated with its use of third-party service providers and as such, conducts assessments of such third-party service providers with respect to their cybersecurity programs and risks and requires third-party service providers to notify the company if they experienced a cybersecurity incident. the company hires experienced security professionals to conduct advanced and realistic cybersecurity attack simulations to verify its program, and conducts regular cybersecurity tabletop exercises with executive management, which are coordinated by a third-party.
we have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.

we own and lease certain real properties to support the business operations of our reportable segments. in 2022, we completed a plan to reduce the real estate footprint used in our business operations to accommodate our move to a permanent remote work environment, a model we have been working under successfully for over three years. our remaining office space is being reconfigured and optimized for utilization and efficiency. while we believe our current and anticipated facilities are adequate to meet our operational needs in the near term, we continually evaluate the adequacy of our properties for our anticipated future needs.

overview molina healthcare, inc., a fortune 500 company, provides managed healthcare services under the medicaid and medicare programs, and through the state insurance marketplaces (the "marketplace"). we served approximately 5.0
million members as of december 31, 2023, located across 20 states.
2023 highlights highlights of our full-year 2023 results included the following:
• net income of $1,091 million, or $18.77 per diluted share, compared to $792 million, or $13.55 per diluted share in 2022;
• membership of 5.0 million at december 31, 2023, mainly reflects the impact of our growth initiatives, which partially offset the impact of medicaid redeterminations;
• total revenue of $34.1 billion, which increased 7% compared to 2022;
• premium revenue of $32.5 billion, which increased 5% compared to 2022;
• consolidated medical care ratio ("mcr") of 88.1%, compared to 88.0% in 2022;
• general and administrative expense ratio ("g&a ratio") of 7.2%, equal to 7.2% in 2022;
• investment income of $394 million, which more than doubled compared to 2022; and
• after-tax margin of 3.2%, which improved compared to 2.5% in 2022.
growth initiatives in addition to delivering strong 2023 financial results, we continued to execute on our profitable growth strategy.
to recap the growth milestones achieved in 2023 and early 2024:
• in january, we successfully re-procured our contract in texas for the state's star+plus program, retaining all eight regions and expecting to grow our market share;
• in july, we successfully launched our iowa medicaid plan which we won in a highly competitive process in late
2022;
• in august, we announced that we were awarded a contract to once again serve medicaid beneficiaries in the state of new mexico;
• in september, we closed on the my choice wisconsin acquisition, further expanding on our market leading ltss franchise;
• effective january 1, 2024, we closed our acquisition of bright health's california medicare business (brand new day and central health plan of california);
• on january 1, 2024, we successfully launched our nebraska health plan; and finally,
• on january 1, 2024, we launched our expanded california medicaid platform, including los angeles county, which approximately doubled the size of our business in the state.
collectively, these acquisitions and requests for proposal ("rfp") successes represent $7 billion of annual premium, which was partially realized in 2023, is expected to be mostly realized in 2024 and is expected to be fully realized in 2025.

consolidated results net income and operating income net income amounted to $1,091 million, or $18.77 per diluted share in 2023, compared with net income of $792
million, or $13.55 per diluted share, in 2022.
operating income was $1,573 million in 2023, compared with $1,173 million in 2022. the increase in operating income was mainly due to higher premium revenues and medical margin, increased investment income, and the impact of the real estate impairment recognized in 2022.

premium revenue premium revenue increased $1.6 billion, or 5%, in 2023, when compared with 2022, driven by the impact of our growth initiatives and changes in business and membership mix in our medicaid and medicare segments, which partially offset the impacts of medicaid redetermination and the expected decline in the marketplace segment.
medical care ratio the consolidated mcr increased to 88.1% in 2023, compared with 88.0% in 2022. the results include an increase in the medicaid and medicare segments, including a modest acuity impact from medicaid redetermination and the impact of changes in business mix, partially offset by certain rate actions, a decrease in the marketplace mcr, and continued strong operating performance and medical cost management. see further discussion in "reportable segments-segment financial performance," below.
prior year reserve development has been favorable for 2023, but its impact on earnings has been mostly absorbed by minimum mlrs and medical cost corridors.
premium tax revenue and expenses the premium tax ratio increased to 3.2% in 2023, compared with 2.7% in 2022, due mainly to the reinstatement of the california managed care organization ("mco") tax by the state's department of health care services in the fourth quarter of 2023, on a retroactive basis effective april 1, 2023. accordingly, we recorded $376 million of premium tax expense and corresponding premium tax revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023. the california mco tax was previously in effect for the entire year ended 2022.
investment income investment income increased to $394 million in 2023, compared with $143 million in 2022. the increase was mainly driven by higher levels of invested assets and higher interest rates.
other revenue other revenue increased slightly to $80 million in 2023, compared with $75 million in 2022. other revenue mainly includes service revenue associated with long-term services and supports consultative services we provide in wisconsin.
general and administrative ("g&a") expenses the g&a ratio was 7.2% in 2023, which is equal to 7.2% in 2022. the g&a ratio in 2023 reflects deployment costs for new business implementation associated with the iowa medicaid contract win that started in july 2023, and the nebraska and california medicaid contract wins that started in january 2024, and was partially offset by the benefits of scale produced by our growth and continued disciplined cost management.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization was $171 million in 2023, compared with $176 million in 2022. the decrease was due to the impairment discussed below offset by intangible assets recorded from recent acquisitions.
impairment in 2022, we recognized an impairment of $208 million on right-of-use ("rou") lease assets and related property and equipment in connection with the reduction in leased space to accommodate the move to a permanent remote work environment. approximately $192 million of the impairment is directly associated with the reduction in leased space used in our business operations. we assessed rou assets for impairment based on a valuation and recoverability analysis, which was determined with the assistance of a third-party real estate specialist. the remaining $16
million of the impairment relates to leasehold improvements and other property and equipment associated with the reduction in leased space.
other operating expenses other operating expenses totaled $128 million in 2023, compared with $58 million in 2022. the increase in 2023
reflects a $41 million credit loss on 2022 marketplace risk adjustment receivables due to the insolvency of an issuer in the texas risk pool, and expense related to litigation dating back to 2013. see notes to consolidated financial statements, note 15, "commitments and contingencies," for additional information. other operating expenses also include service costs associated with long-term services and supports consultative services we provide in wisconsin, as noted above.

interest expense interest expense was $109 million in 2023, compared with $110 million in 2022.
income taxes income tax expense amounted to $373 million in 2023, or 25.5% of pretax income, compared with income tax expense of
$271 million in 2022, or 25.5% of the pretax income.
reportable segments as of december 31, 2023, we served approximately 5.0 million members eligible for medicaid, medicare, and other government-sponsored healthcare programs for low-income families and individuals, including marketplace members, most of whom receive government premium subsidies.
we currently have reportable segments consisting of: 1) medicaid; 2) medicare; 3) marketplace; and 4) other.
the medicaid, medicare, and marketplace segments represent the government-funded or sponsored programs under which we offer managed healthcare services. the other segment, which is insignificant to our consolidated results of operations, includes long-term services and supports consultative services in wisconsin.
see "item 1. business," for further description of our segments.
how we assess performance we derive our revenues primarily from health insurance premiums. our primary customers are state medicaid agencies and the federal government.
the key metrics used to assess the performance of our medicaid, medicare, and marketplace segments are premium revenue, medical margin and medical care ratio ("mcr"). mcr represents the amount of medical care costs as a percentage of premium revenue. therefore, the underlying medical margin, or the amount earned by the medicaid, medicare, and marketplace segments after medical costs are deducted from premium revenue, represents the most important measure of earnings reviewed by management, and is used by our chief executive officer to review results, assess performance, and allocate resources. the key metric used to assess the performance of our other segment is service margin. the service margin is equal to service revenue minus cost of service revenue.
management's discussion and analysis of the change in medical margin is discussed below under "segment financial performance." for more information, see notes to consolidated financial statements, note 16, "segments."

medicaid key factors affecting results for this segment include:
• our growth initiatives, including acquisitions and expansion into new states, drove an increase in member months during the year, despite the impact of redeterminations, and changes in membership mix;
• impact of redetermination, including the loss of approximately 500,000 members, and a moderate impact from the effect of acuity shifts, net of the beneficial impact of risk corridors; and
• improved operating performance, including medical cost management, and prospective and retrospective rates.
medicaid premium revenue increased $1.5 billion, or 6% in 2023, when compared with 2022. the increase was mainly due to the impact of our growth initiatives, changes in business and membership mix, and the beneficial impact of risk corridors in several states. we benefited from membership growth related to the suspension of redeterminations through the end of the first quarter of 2023. additionally, membership increased due to the agewell acquisition that closed in the fourth quarter of 2022, the commencement of the iowa medicaid contract in july 2023, and the impact from the my choice wisconsin acquisition that closed on september 1, 2023. these increases were partially offset by the net membership impact of redetermination. by the end of the third quarter of 2023, all states within our medicaid footprint had begun disenrolling members, which is expected to continue through the first half of
2024.
the medical margin of our medicaid program decreased $8 million in 2023, when compared with 2022. the year-over-
year change was driven by an increase in mcr, partially offset by the increased premium revenues discussed above.
the medicaid mcr increased 70 basis points to 88.7% in 2023, from 88.0% in 2022. the increase was mainly attributable to changes in business and membership mix, including acquisitions and commencement of the iowa contract, and a modest acuity impact from redetermination, partially offset by prospective and retrospective rates, the beneficial impact of risk corridor offsets in several states, and improved operating performance. the medicaid mcr for the year ended december 31, 2023 is consistent with our long-term target range.
medicare key factors affecting results for this segment include:
• increased utilization of supplemental benefits, in-home services, and high-cost drugs;
• our continued expansion in mapd and d-snp membership; and
• the impact of lower risk-adjusted premiums associated with the new mapd and d-snp members, partially offset by higher risk scores on renewing members.
medicare premium revenue increased $384 million, or 10%, in 2023 compared to 2022. the increase was primarily due to the impact of mapd and d-snp membership expansion, including organic membership growth in existing states and the closing of my choice wisconsin on september 1, 2023.
the medical margin for medicare decreased $49 million in 2023 compared to 2022. the year-over-year decrease was mainly due to the increase in mcr discussed below, partially offset by the increase in the premium revenues.

risk scores on renewing members that more closely reflect the acuity of our membership. the medicare mcr for the year ended december 31, 2023 is above our long-term target range.
marketplace key factors affecting results for this segment include:
• execution of our product and pricing strategy, which resulted in an overall reduction in membership, repositioning in the metallic tier membership mix, and returning the business to target margins; and
• achievement of member risk scores and associated risk-adjusted premium that are commensurate with the health status, or acuity, of our marketplace members.
marketplace premium revenue decreased $238 million in 2023 compared to 2022. the decrease was mainly due to an expected decrease in membership in line with our product and pricing strategy, partially offset by an increase in premium revenue pmpm. our marketplace membership as of december 31, 2023, amounted to 281,000 members, representing a decrease of 67,000 members compared to december 31, 2022. the increase in premium revenue pmpm was due to higher silver metal tier product mix consistent with the product and pricing strategy and higher risk adjustment premiums.
the marketplace medical margin increased $209 million in 2023, primarily due to the decrease in mcr discussed below, partially offset by the decrease in membership and premiums.
the marketplace mcr decreased to 75.3% in 2023, compared to 87.2% in 2022, or 1,190 basis points. the decrease in
2023 resulted mainly from our product and pricing strategy to achieve our target margins, including higher risk adjustment premium on silver metal tier and renewal members, commensurate with the acuity profile of those members.
in addition, the comparison reflects a favorable change in the 2022 risk adjustment payable recognized in 2023
compared to an unfavorable change in the 2021 risk adjustment payable recognized in 2022. silver metal tier products incur less mcr seasonality than bronze metal tier products due to lower deductibles. these impacts were partially offset by changes in membership mix discussed above. our 2023 marketplace mcr was well below our long-
term target range.
other the other segment includes service revenues and costs associated with the long-term services and supports consultative services we provide in wisconsin, and also includes certain corporate amounts not allocated to the medicaid, medicare, or marketplace segments. such amounts were immaterial to our consolidated results of operations for 2023 and 2022.
liquidity, financial condition and capital resources liquidity we manage our cash, investments, and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility. we forecast, analyze, and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy.
we maintain liquidity at two levels: 1) the regulated health plan subsidiaries; and 2) the parent company.
our regulated health plan subsidiaries' primary liquidity requirements include payment of medical claims and other health care services; payment of certain settlements with our state and federal customers, such as minimum medical loss ratio and risk corridors and marketplace risk transfers on behalf of cms; general and administrative costs directly incurred or paid through an administrative services agreement to the parent company; and federal tax payments to the parent company under an intercompany tax sharing agreement. our regulated health plan subsidiaries meet their liquidity needs by generating cash flows from operating activities, primarily from premium revenue; cash flows from investing activities, including investment income and sales of investments; and capital contributions received from our parent company.
our regulated health plan subsidiaries are each subject to applicable state regulations that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of capital and surplus. we continue to maintain levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our regulated health plan subsidiaries that we believe are appropriate. see further discussion under "regulatory capital and dividend restrictions" below. when available and as permitted by applicable regulations, cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated health plan subsidiaries is generally paid in the form of dividends to our parent company to be used for general corporate purposes. the regulated health plan subsidiaries paid dividends to the parent company amounting to $705 million in 2023 and $668 million in 2022.

parent company liquidity requirements generally consist of payment of administrative costs not directly incurred by our regulated operations, including, but not limited to, staffing costs, lease payments, branding and certain information technology services; capital contributions paid to our regulated health plan subsidiaries, including funding for newer health plans; capital expenditures; debt service; funding for common stock purchases, acquisitions and other growth-related activities; and federal tax payments. the parent company contributed capital of $221 million and $159 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, to our regulated health plan subsidiaries to satisfy statutory capital and surplus requirements. the higher contributions in 2023 were mainly attributed to fund growth in our wisconsin and iowa health plans. our parent company normally meets its liquidity requirements from administrative services fees earned under administrative services agreements; dividends received from our regulated subsidiaries; federal tax payments collected from the regulated subsidiaries; proceeds received from the issuance of debt and equity securities; and cash flows from investing activities, including investment income and sales of investments.
cash, cash equivalents and investments at the parent company amounted to $742 million and $375 million as of december 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. the increase in 2023 was primarily due to the dividends received from our regulated health plan subsidiaries, partially offset by the timing of corporate payments, capital contributions to regulated health plan subsidiaries and net cash paid for acquisitions. on january 1, 2024, we closed on our acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of brand new day and central health plan of california for $441 million. see notes to consolidated financial statements, note 4, "business combinations," for further information.
investments after considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short-term obligations in longer term, investment-grade, and marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. these investments are made pursuant to board-approved investment policies which conform to applicable state laws and regulations.
our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity, preserve capital, and maximize total return on invested assets, all in a manner consistent with state requirements that prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest. these investment policies require that our investments have final maturities of less than
15 years, or less than 15 years average life for structured securities. professional portfolio managers operating under documented guidelines manage our investments and a portion of our cash equivalents. our portfolio managers must obtain our prior approval before selling investments where the loss position of those investments exceeds certain levels.
the overall rating of our portfolio is a+. our investment policy has directives in conjunction with state guidelines to minimize risks and exposures in volatile markets. additionally, our portfolio managers assist us in navigating the current volatility in the capital markets.
our restricted investments are invested principally in cash, cash equivalents, u.s. treasury securities, and corporate debt securities; we have the ability to hold such restricted investments until maturity. all of our unrestricted investments are classified as current assets.
cash flow activities our cash flows are summarized as follows:

operating activities we typically receive capitation payments monthly, in advance of payments for medical claims; however, government payors may adjust their payment schedules, positively or negatively impacting our reported cash flows from operating activities in any given period. for example, government payors may delay our premium payments, or they may prepay the following month's premium payment.
net cash provided by operations was $1,662 million in 2023, compared with $773 million in 2022. the $889 million increase in 2023 cash flow was due to the growth in operations and net earnings from organic and new rfp starts and acquisitions, accompanied by the net impact of timing differences in government receivables and payables.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $744 million in 2023, compared with $790 million in 2022. the change in cash flow was primarily due to the net activity of proceeds and purchases of investments, which were net purchases of $661 million in 2023 and net purchases of $515 million in 2022. in 2023 and 2022, net cash outflow related to acquisitions was $3 million and $134 million, respectively.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was $58 million in 2023, compared with $441 million in 2022, an increase in year-over-year cash flow of $383 million. in 2023, cash outflows included $60 million for common stock withheld to settle employee tax obligations. in 2022, cash outflows included common stock purchases of $400 million and $54
million for common stock withheld to settle employee tax obligations. additionally, we paid $20 million in 2022 to settle contingent consideration liabilities.
financial condition we believe that our cash resources, borrowing capacity available under our credit agreement as discussed further below in "future sources and uses of liquidity-future sources," and internally generated funds will be sufficient to support our operations, regulatory requirements, debt repayment obligations and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.
on a consolidated basis, as of december 31, 2023, our working capital was $4.4 billion compared with $3.2 billion as of december 31, 2022. at december 31, 2023, our cash and investments amounted to $9.4 billion, compared with
$7.7 billion of cash and investments at december 31, 2022. a significant portion of our portfolio is held in cash and cash equivalents and we do not anticipate the fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position since we intend to hold our securities to maturity.
net unrealized losses on our investments classified as current and available for sale decreased to $108 million at december 31, 2023 compared to $210 million at december 31, 2022. we have determined that the unrealized losses primarily resulted from fluctuating interest rates, rather than a deterioration of the creditworthiness of the issuers.
because of the statutory restrictions that inhibit the ability of our health plan subsidiaries to transfer net assets to us, the amount of retained earnings readily available to pay dividends to our stockholders is generally limited to cash, cash equivalents and investments held by our unregulated parent. for more information, see the
"liquidity" discussion presented above.
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions each of our regulated, wholly owned subsidiaries must maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital determined by statute or regulations. such statutes, regulations and capital requirements also restrict the timing, payment and amount of dividends and other distributions, loans or advances that may be paid to us as the sole stockholder. to the extent our subsidiaries must comply with these regulations, they may not have the financial flexibility to transfer funds to us. based upon current statutes and regulations, the minimum capital and surplus requirement for these subsidiaries was estimated to be approximately $2.3 billion at both december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022.
the aggregate capital and surplus of our wholly owned subsidiaries was in excess of these minimum capital requirements as of both dates.
under applicable regulatory requirements, the amount of dividends that may be paid by our wholly owned subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities as of december 31, 2023, was approximately $380 million in the aggregate. the subsidiaries may pay dividends over this amount, but only after approval is granted by the regulatory authorities.

based on our cash and investments balances as of december 31, 2023, management believes that our regulated wholly owned subsidiaries remain well capitalized and exceed their regulatory minimum requirements. we have the ability, and have committed to provide, additional capital to each of our health plans as necessary to ensure compliance with minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements.
capital structure in september 2023, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $750 million of our common stock. this new program supersedes the stock purchase program previously approved by our board of directors in november 2022
and extends through december 31, 2024.
as debt held by the parent company comes due, we typically engage in a new private offering of debt to retire and replace the prior issuance. for several years we saw a continued decline in interest rates, which benefited our overall cost of capital during that time. however, interest rates have increased since we issued our 3.875% notes due 2032 in 2021. accordingly, future refinancing may occur at a higher rate than those we have achieved historically. this would increase our cost of capital in the future or may cause us to pursue alternative financing sources, should the need arise.
we are not a party to any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
debt ratings each of our senior notes is rated "bb-" by standard & poor's, and "ba3" by moody's investor service, inc. a downgrade in our ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and increase our borrowing costs.
financial covenants the credit agreement contains customary non-financial and financial covenants, including a net leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. such ratios are computed as defined by the terms of the credit agreement.
in addition, the indentures governing each of our outstanding senior notes contain cross-default provisions that are triggered upon default by us or any of our subsidiaries on any indebtedness in excess of the amount specified in the applicable indenture. as of december 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants under the credit agreement and other long-term debt.
future sources and uses of liquidity future sources our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from premium revenue, which is generally received a short time before related healthcare services are paid. premium revenue is our primary source of liquidity. thus, any decline in the receipt of premium revenue, and our profitability, could have a negative impact on our liquidity.
regulatory developments . excluding acquisitions and our exit from puerto rico, we estimate we added approximately one million new medicaid members since march 31, 2020, when we first began to report on the impacts of the pandemic. we believe this membership increase was mainly due to the suspension of redeterminations for medicaid eligibility. the consolidated appropriations act of 2023 authorized states to resume redeterminations and terminate coverage for ineligible enrollees starting on april 1, 2023, irrespective of the status of the phe. consequently, during the third quarter of 2023, all states in which we operate had begun disenrolling members. in 2023, we estimate we lost approximately 500,000 members due to redeterminations, offset by new enrollment and expect to lose an additional 100,000 members in 2024. given the high number of procedural terminations and increasing interventions by cms and various states, we expect reconnects will likely continue, decreasing currently reported losses. although the medical cost profile of members who have been disenrolled is more favorable than the medicaid segment average, when combined with the beneficial impact of corridor offsets in several states, our medicaid mcr for the year ended december 31, 2023 was within our expectations. based on the experience to date, we expect that we will ultimately retain approximately 40% of the membership gained since march 31, 2020.
dividends from subsidiaries. when available and as permitted by applicable regulations, cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated health plans is generally paid in the form of dividends to our unregulated parent company to be used for general corporate purposes. for more information on our regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions, refer to notes to consolidated financial statements, note 15, "commitments and contingencies-regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions," and note 17, "condensed financial information of registrant-note c - dividends and capital contributions."

credit agreement borrowing capacity. as of december 31, 2023, we had available borrowing capacity of $1 billion under the credit facility. in addition, the credit agreement provides for a $15 million swingline sub-facility and a $100 million letter of credit sub-facility, as well as incremental term loans available to finance certain acquisitions up to $500 million, plus an unlimited amount of such term loans as long as we maintain a minimum consolidated net leverage ratio. see further discussion in the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 11,
"debt."
future uses common stock purchases. in september 2023, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $750 million of our common stock. this new program supersedes the stock purchase program previously approved by our board of directors in november 2022 and extends through december 31, 2024. the exact timing and amount of any repurchase is determined by management based on market conditions and share price, in addition to other factors, and subject to the restrictions relating to volume, price, and timing under applicable law. as of february 13, 2024, $750 million remained available to purchase our common stock under this program through december 31, 2024. see further information in the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 13, "stockholders' equity."
acquisitions . we have a disciplined and steady approach to growth. organic growth, which includes leveraging our existing health plan portfolio and winning new territories, is our highest priority. in addition to organic growth, we will consider targeted acquisitions that are a strategic fit that we believe will leverage operational synergies, and lead to incremental earnings accretion. for further information on our acquisitions, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 4, "business combinations."
on january 1, 2024, we closed on our acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of brand new day and central health plan of california for $441 million.
regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions. we have the ability, and have committed to provide, additional capital to each of our health plans as necessary to ensure compliance with minimum statutory capital requirements.
the molina healthcare charitable foundation. in 2020, we announced our commitment of $150 million to fund the molina healthcare charitable foundation (the "foundation"), an independent not-for-profit charitable foundation. we have contributed $20 million to the foundation on a cumulative basis as of december 31, 2023. in the first three years of its existence, our charitable foundation funded nearly 700 grants to local community organizations in 25
states that address social determinants of health, disaster relief, mental health, maternal child health and other health-related concerns afflicting our communities in need.
contractual obligations. we are party to various contractual obligations that we will be required to satisfy over the short and long term. the majority are discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements and primarily include the following:
• medical claims and benefits payable. see notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies," and note 10, "medical claims and benefits payable," for further detail.
• amounts due government agencies. see notes to consolidated financial statements, notes 2, "significant accounting policies," for further detail.
• debt obligations. see notes to consolidated financial statements, note 11, "debt," for further detail of our long-term debt and the timing of expected future payments. interest payments are paid semi-annually.
• leases. see notes to consolidated financial statements, note 8, "leases," for further detail of our finance and operating lease obligations and the timing of expected future payments.
some items are based on management's estimates and assumptions about obligations, including duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties, and other factors. because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary. additionally, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring services used in our operations. however, we believe these other agreements do not contain material non-cancelable commitments.
critical accounting estimates when we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we use estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. actual results could differ from these estimates, and some differences could be material.
our most significant accounting estimates, which include a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity, include the following:

• medical costs, claims and benefits payable. see discussion below, and refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies," and note 10, "medical claims and benefits payable"
for more information.
• premium revenue recognition and amounts due government agencies: risk adjustment. for a discussion of this topic, including amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies."
• business combinations, and goodwill and intangible assets, net. for a comprehensive discussion of this topic, including amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies," note 4, "business combinations," and note 9, "goodwill and intangible assets, net."
medical care costs, medical claims and benefits payable medical care costs are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include fee-for-service claims, pharmacy benefits, capitation payments to providers, and various other medically-related costs. under fee-for-
service claims arrangements with providers, we retain the financial responsibility for medical care provided and incur costs based on actual utilization of hospital and physician services. such medical care costs include amounts paid by us as well as estimated medical claims and benefits payable for costs that were incurred but not paid as of the reporting date ("ibnp"). pharmacy benefits represent payments for members' prescription drug costs, net of rebates from drug manufacturers. we estimate pharmacy rebates based on historical and current utilization of prescription drugs and contractual provisions. capitation payments represent monthly contractual fees paid to providers, who are responsible for providing medical care to members, which could include medical or ancillary costs like dental, vision and other supplemental health benefits. such capitation costs are fixed in advance of the periods covered and are not subject to significant accounting estimates. other medical care costs include all medically-related administrative costs, amounts due to providers pursuant to risk-sharing or other incentive arrangements, provider claims, and other healthcare expenses. examples of medically-related administrative costs include expenses relating to health education, quality assurance, case management, care coordination, disease management, and 24-hour on-call nurses. additionally, we include an estimate for the cost of settling claims incurred through the reporting date in our medical claims and benefits payable liability.
the following table illustrates consolidated medical care costs by type for the periods indicated:

medical claims and benefits payable consist mainly of fee-for-service ibnp, unpaid pharmacy claims, capitation costs, other medical costs, including amounts payable to providers pursuant to risk-sharing or other incentive arrangements and amounts payable to providers on behalf of certain state agencies for certain state assessments in which we assume no financial risk. ibnp includes the costs of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date which have been reported to us, and our best estimate of the cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us. when more complete claims payment information and healthcare cost trend data becomes available, we reflect changes in these estimates as an increase or decrease to medical care costs in the consolidated results of operations in the period in which they are determined.

membership, product mix, seasonality, benefit changes or changes in fee schedules, provider contract changes, prior authorizations and the incidence of catastrophic or pandemic cases.
for claims incurred more than three months before the financial statement date, we mainly use estimated completion factors to estimate the ultimate cost of those claims. completion factors measure the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will ultimately be paid for a given month of service based on historical claims payment patterns. we analyze historical claims payment patterns by comparing claim incurred dates to claim payment dates to estimate completion factors. the estimated completion factors are then applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claims cost for a given month's incurred claim activity. the difference between the estimated ultimate claims cost and the claims paid through the financial statement date represents our estimate of claims remaining to be paid as of the financial statement date and is included in our ibnp liability .
for claims incurred within three months before the financial statement date, actual claims paid are a less reliable measure of our ultimate cost since a large portion of medical claims are not submitted to us until several months after services have been submitted. accordingly, we estimate our ibnp liability for claims incurred during these months based on a blend of estimated completion factors and assumed medical care cost trend. the assumed medical care cost trend represents the year-over-year change in per-member per-month medical care costs, which can be affected by many factors including, but not limited to, our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, changes in member demographics, catastrophes and epidemics , and other relevant factors.
actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that our overall best estimate of the ibnp liability has a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient, where the liability is sufficient to account for moderately adverse conditions. accordingly, our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate including a provision for moderately adverse conditions for each current period. this provision is reported as part of "components of medical care costs related to: current year" in the table presented in note 10, "medical claims and benefits payable." adverse conditions are situations that may cause actual claims to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate, such as changes in the magnitude or severity of claims, uncertainties related to our entry into new geographical markets or provision of services to new populations, changes in state-controlled fee schedules, and modifications or upgrades to our claims processing systems and practices. therefore, in many situations, the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice.
when subsequent actual claims payments are less than we estimated, we recognize a benefit for favorable prior period development that is reported as part of "components of medical care costs related to: prior years" in the table presented in note 10. assuming stability in the size of our membership, the use of this consistent methodology, during any given period, usually results in the replenishment of reserves at a level that generally offsets the benefit of favorable prior period development in that period. in the case of material growth or decline of membership, replenishment can exceed or fall short of the favorable development, assuming all other factors remain unchanged.
because of the significant degree of judgment involved in estimation of our ibnp liability, there is considerable variability and uncertainty inherent in such estimates. the following table reflects the hypothetical change in our estimate of claims liability as of december 31, 2023 that would result if we change our completion factors for the fourth through the twelfth months preceding december 31, 2023, by the percentages indicated. a reduction in the completion factor results in an increase in medical claims liabilities. dollar amounts are in millions.

there are many related factors working in conjunction with one another that determine the accuracy of our estimates, some of which are qualitative in nature rather than quantitative. therefore, we are seldom able to quantify the impact that any single factor has on a change in estimate. given the variability inherent in the reserving process, we will only be able to identify specific factors if they represent a significant departure from expectations. as a result, we do not expect to be able to fully quantify the impact of individual factors on changes in estimates.
recently issued accounting standards refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies," for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that affect us.

our earnings and financial position are exposed to financial market risk relating to changes in interest rates, and the resulting impact on investment income and interest expense.
substantially all of our investments and restricted investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. assuming a hypothetical and immediate 1% increase in market interest rates at december 31, 2023, the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately $104
million. declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income.
for further information on fair value measurements and our investment portfolio, please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 5, "fair value measurements," and note 6, "investments."
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest based, at our election, on a base rate or other defined rate, plus, in each case, the applicable margin. for further information, see notes to consolidated financial statements, note 11, "debt."

report of independent registered public accounting firm to the stockholders and the board of directors of molina healthcare, inc.
opinion on the financial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of molina healthcare, inc. (the "company") as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2023, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company at december 31, 2023 and
2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december
31, 2023, in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) ("pcaob"), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2023, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework), and our report dated february 13, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
basis for opinion these financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
critical audit matter the critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. the communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
incurred but not paid (ibnp) claims reserves as of december 31, 2023, the company's liability for fee-for-service claims incurred but not paid ("ibnp"), comprised $2,901 million of the $4,204 million of medical claims and benefits payable. the company's ibnp liability is determined using actuarial methods that include a number of factors and assumptions, including completion factors, which seek to measure the cumulative percentage of description of the matter    claims expense that will have been paid for a given month of service as of the reporting date, based on historical payment patterns, and assumed health care cost trend factors, which represent an estimate of claims expense based on recent claims expense levels and healthcare cost levels. there is significant uncertainty inherent in determining management's best estimate of completion and trend factors, which are used to calculate actuarial estimates of incurred but not paid claims.

we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the company's controls over the process for estimating the ibnp liability. this included testing management how we addressed the matter in our audit    review controls over completion and trend factor assumptions, and management's review and approval of actuarial methods used to calculate ibnp liability, including the data inputs and outputs of those models.
to test the ibnp liability, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the calculation by testing reconciliations of underlying claims and membership data recorded in source systems to the actuarial reserving calculations, and comparing a sample of claims to source documentation. with the assistance of ey actuarial specialists, we evaluated the company's selection and weighting of actuarial methods by comparing the weightings used in the current estimate to those used in prior periods and those used in the industry for the specific types of insurance. to evaluate significant assumptions used by management in the actuarial methods, we compared assumptions to current and historical claims trends, to those used historically and to current industry benchmarks. we also compared management's recorded ibnp liability to a range of reasonable ibnp estimates calculated independently by our ey actuarial specialists.
additionally, we performed a review of the prior period estimates using subsequent claims development, and we reviewed and evaluated management's disclosures surrounding fee-for-service claims ibnp.

notes to consolidated financial statements
1. organization and basis of presentation organization and operations molina healthcare, inc. provides managed healthcare services under the medicaid and medicare programs, and through the state insurance marketplaces (the "marketplace"). molina was founded in 1980 as a provider organization serving low-income families in southern california and reincorporated in delaware in 2002. we currently have fourreportable segments consisting of: 1) medicaid; 2) medicare; 3) marketplace; and 4) other. our reportable segments are consistent with how we currently manage the business and view the markets we serve.
as of december 31, 2023, we served approximately 5.0million members eligible for government-sponsored healthcare programs, located across 20states.
our state medicaid contracts typically have terms of threeto five years, contain renewal options exercisable by the state medicaid agency, and allow either the state or the health plan to terminate the contract with or without cause. such contracts are subject to risk of loss in states that issue requests for proposal ("rfp") open to competitive bidding by other health plans. if one of our health plans is not a successful responsive bidder to a state rfp, its contract may not be renewed.
in addition to contract renewal, our state medicaid contracts may be periodically amended to include or exclude certain health benefits (such as pharmacy services, behavioral health services, or long-term care services);
populations such as the aged, blind or disabled ("abd"); and regions or service areas.
in medicare, we enter into medicare advantage-part d contracts with the centers for medicare and medicaid services
("cms") annually, and for dual-eligible programs, we enter into contracts with cms, in partnership with each state's department of health and human services. such contracts typically have terms of oneto three years.
in marketplace, we enter into contracts with cms, which end on december 31 of each year, and must be renewed annually.
consolidation and presentation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of molina healthcare, inc., and its subsidiaries. all significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. financial information related to subsidiaries acquired during any year is included only for periods subsequent to their acquisition. we have reclassified certain 2022 amounts in the deferred tax asset and liabilities table in note 12, "income taxes,"
to conform to the 2023 presentation. in the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results as of the date and for the periods presented have been included; such adjustments consist of normal recurring adjustments.
use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. estimates also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from these estimates.
2. significant accounting policies cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible into known amounts of cash and have a maturity of three months or less on the date of purchase. the following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents reported within the accompanying consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. the restricted cash and cash equivalents presented below are included in "restricted investments" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows investments our investments are principally held in debt securities, which are grouped into two separate categories for accounting and reporting purposes: available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities. available-for-
sale ("afs") securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses, if any, are recorded in stockholders' equity as other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes. held-to-maturity ("htm")
securities are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and unrealized holding gains or losses are not generally recognized. realized gains and losses and unrealized losses arising from credit-related factors with respect to afs and htm securities are included in the determination of net income. the cost of securities sold is determined using the specific-identification method.
our investment policy requires that all of our investments have final maturities of less than 15years, or less than
15years average life for structured securities. investments and restricted investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase. declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income.
in general, our afs securities are classified as current assets without regard to the securities' contractual maturity dates because they may be readily liquidated. we monitor our investments for credit-related impairment.for comprehensive discussions of the fair value and classification of our investments, see note 5, "fair value measurements," and note 6, "investments."
accrued interest receivable relating to our afs and htm securities is presented within "prepaid expenses and other current assets" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and amounted to $ 53million and $ 35million at december 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. we do not measure an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable. instead, we write off accrued interest receivable that has not been collected within 90 days of the interest payment due date. we recognize such write-offs as a reversal of investment income. no accrued interest was written off during the year ended december 31, 2023 and 2022.
receivables receivables consist primarily of premium amounts due from government agencies, which are subject to potential retroactive adjustments. we apply the current expected credit loss model to measure expected credits losses on our receivables based on available information about past events and reasonable and supportable forecasts. because substantially all of our receivable amounts are readily determinable and substantially all of our creditors are governmental authorities, our allowance for credit losses is insignificant. any amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged to expense when such determination is made.

business combinations we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires us to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. as discussed below, the excess of the purchase consideration transferred over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. while we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. as a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. measurement period adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are determined, as if they had been completed at the acquisition date. upon the conclusion of the final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, or one year after the date of acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded within our consolidated results of operations.
refer to note 4, "business combinations," and note 9, "goodwill and intangible assets, net," for further details.
long-lived assets, including intangible assets long-lived assets consist primarily of property, equipment, capitalized software (see note 7, "property, equipment, and capitalized software, net"), and intangible assets resulting from acquisitions. long-lived assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that the asset's (or asset group's) carrying value may not be recoverable. finite-lived, separately-identified intangible assets acquired in business combinations are assets that represent future expected benefits but lack physical substance (such as purchased contract rights and provider contracts). intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and are then amortized on a straight-
line basis over their expected useful lives, generally between fiveand 16years.
determining the fair value of separately identifiable intangible assets requires management to make estimates, which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset. determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment, as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives. the most significant intangible asset we typically record in a business combination is contract rights associated with membership acquired. in determining the estimated fair value of the intangible assets, we typically apply the income approach, which discounts the projected future net cash flows using an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk associated with such projected future cash flows. the most critical assumptions used in determining the fair value of contract rights include forecasted operating margins and the weighted average cost of capital.
our intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that a finite-lived intangible asset's (or asset group's) carrying value may not be recoverable. consideration is given to a number of potential impairment indicators, including the ability of our health plan subsidiaries to obtain the renewal by amendment of their contracts in each state prior to the actual expiration of their contracts. however, there can be no assurance that these contracts will continue to be renewed. following the identification of any potential impairment indicators, to determine whether an impairment exists, we would compare the carrying amount of a finite-
lived intangible asset with the greater of the undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the asset or related group of assets, or its value under the asset liquidation method. if it is determined that the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable, the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value is recorded as an impairment.refer to note 9, "goodwill and intangible assets, net," for further details.
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more frequently if impairment indicators are present. impairment indicators may include experienced or expected operating cash-flow deterioration or losses, significant losses of membership, loss of state funding, loss of state contracts, and other factors. goodwill is impaired if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.
this excess is recorded as an impairment loss and adjusted if necessary for the impact of tax-deductible goodwill.
the loss recognized may not exceed the total goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.

goodwill assessment of our reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2023, and did not identify any factors indicating that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeded their estimated fair values.
if performing a quantitative assessment, we generally estimate the fair values of our reporting units by applying the income approach, using discounted cash flows. the base year in the reporting units' discounted cash flows is derived from the annual financial planning cycle, which commences in the fourth quarter of the year. as part of a quantitative assessment, we may also apply the asset liquidation method to estimate the fair value of individual reporting units, which is computed as total assets minus total liabilities, excluding intangible assets and deferred taxes. finally, we apply a market approach to reconcile the value of our reporting units to our consolidated market value. under the market approach, we consider publicly-traded comparable company information to determine revenue and earnings multiples which are used to estimate our reporting units' fair values. the assumptions used are consistent with those used in our long-range business plan and annual planning process.
however, if these assumptions differ from actual results, the outcome of our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected.
leases right-of-use ("rou") assets represent our right to use the underlying assets over the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation for lease payments arising from the related leases. rou assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when we believe it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. if applicable, we account for lease and non-lease components within a lease as a single lease component.
because most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of lease payments. lease expenses for operating lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and the related rou assets and liabilities are reduced to the present value of the remaining lease payments at the end of each period. finance lease payments reduce finance lease liabilities, the related rou assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and interest expense is recognized using the effective interest method.
the significant majority of our operating leases consist of long-term operating leases for office space. short-term leases (those with terms of 12 months or less) are not recorded as rou assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. for certain leases that represent a portfolio of similar assets, such as a fleet of vehicles, we apply a portfolio approach to account for the related rou assets and liabilities, rather than account for such assets and the related liabilities individually. a nominal number of our lease agreements include rental payments that adjust periodically for inflation. our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.refer to note 8, "leases," for further details.
medical claims and benefits payable medical care costs are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include fee-for-service claims, pharmacy benefits, capitation payments to providers, and various other medically-related costs. under fee-for-
service claims arrangements with providers, we retain the financial responsibility for medical care provided and incur costs based on actual utilization of hospital and physician services. such medical care costs include amounts paid by us as well as estimated medical claims and benefits payable for costs that were incurred but not paid as of the reporting date ("ibnp"). pharmacy benefits represent payments for members' prescription drug costs, net of rebates from drug manufacturers. we estimate pharmacy rebates based on historical and current utilization of prescription drugs and contractual provisions. capitation payments represent monthly contractual fees paid to providers, who are responsible for providing medical care to members, which could include medical or ancillary costs like dental, vision and other supplemental health benefits. such capitation costs are fixed in advance of the periods covered and are not subject to significant accounting estimates. other medical care costs include all medically-related administrative costs, amounts due to providers pursuant to risk-sharing or other incentive arrangements, provider claims, and other healthcare expenses. examples of medically-related administrative costs include expenses relating to health education, quality assurance, case management, care coordination, disease management, and 24-hour on-call nurses. additionally, we include an estimate for the cost of settling claims incurred through the reporting date in our medical claims and benefits payable liability .

in these estimates as an increase or decrease to medical care costs in the consolidated results of operations in the period in which they are determined.
the estimation of the ibnp liability requires a significant degree of judgment in applying actuarial methods, determining the appropriate assumptions and considering numerous factors. of those factors, we consider estimated completion factors and the assumed healthcare cost trend to be the most critical assumptions. other relevant factors also include, but are not limited to, healthcare service utilization trends, claim inventory levels, changes in membership, product mix, seasonality, benefit changes or changes in medicaid fee schedules, provider contract changes, prior authorizations and the incidence of catastrophic or pandemic cases.
because of the significant degree of judgment involved in estimation of our ibnp liability, there is considerable variability and uncertainty inherent in such estimates. each reporting period, the recognized ibnp liability represents our best estimate of the total amount of unpaid claims incurred as of the balance sheet date using a consistent methodology in estimating our ibnp liability, including a provision for moderately adverse conditions for each current period. we believe our current estimates are reasonable and adequate; however, the development of our estimate is a continuous process that we monitor and update as more complete claims payment information and healthcare cost trend data becomes available. actual medical care costs may be less than we previously estimated
(favorable development) or more than we previously estimated (unfavorable development), and any differences could be material. any adjustments to reflect favorable development would be recognized as a decrease to medical care costs, and any adjustments to reflect unfavorable development would be recognized as an increase to medical care costs , in the period in which the adjustments are determined.
refer to note 10, "medical claims and benefits payable," for a table presenting the components of the change in our medical claims and benefits payable, for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
premium revenue recognition and amounts due government agencies premium revenue is generated from our contracts with state and federal agencies, in connection with our participation in the medicaid, medicare, and marketplace programs. premium revenue is generally received based on per member per month ("pmpm") rates established in advance of the periods covered. these premium revenues are recognized in the month that members are entitled to receive healthcare services, and premiums collected in advance are deferred. many of our contracts contain provisions that may adjust or limit revenue or profit. consequently, we recognize premium revenue as it is earned under such provisions. liabilities accrued for premiums to be returned under such provisions are reported in the aggregate as "amounts due government agencies" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. state medicaid programs and the federal medicare program periodically adjust premium rates, including certain components of premium revenue that are subject to accounting estimates further discussed below.
minimum mlr, medical cost corridors and profit sharing. a portion of our medicaid premium revenue may be returned if certain minimum amounts are not spent on defined medical care costs as a percentage of premium revenue, or minimum medical loss ratio ("minimum mlr"). under certain medical cost corridor provisions, the health plans may receive additional premiums if amounts spent on medical care costs exceed a defined maximum threshold. this includes remaining risk corridors that were enacted by various states in 2020 in response to the reduced demand for medical services stemming from covid-19. our contracts with certain states contain profit sharing provisions under which we refund amounts to the states if our health plans generate profit above a certain specified percentage. in some cases, we are limited in the amount of administrative costs that we may deduct in calculating the refund, if any.we recorded aggregate liabilities under the terms of such contract provisions of $ 1,344million and $
1,145million at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, to amounts due government agencies.
the affordable care act ("aca") established a minimum mlr of 85% for medicare. federal regulations define what constitutes medical costs and premium revenue. if the minimum mlr is not met, we may be required to pay rebates to the federal government. our dual-eligible plans may also be subject to state-specific minimum mlrs, medical cost corridors, and profit-sharing provisions. we recognize estimated rebates as an adjustment to premium revenue in our consolidated statements of income. we recorded a liability under the terms of such contract provisions of $
64million and $ 84million at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, to amounts due government agencies.
the aca established a minimum mlr of 80% for the marketplace. if the minimum mlr is not met, we may be required to pay rebates to our marketplace policyholders. the marketplace risk adjustment program discussed below is taken into consideration when computing the minimum mlr. we recognize estimated rebates under the minimum mlr as an adjustment to premium revenue in our consolidated statements of income. the amounts were insignificant at december 31, 2023
and 2022.

risk adjustment. our medicare premiums are subject to retroactive increase or decrease based on the health status of our medicare members (as measured by member risk score). we estimate our members' risk scores and the related amount of medicare revenue that will ultimately be realized for the periods presented based on our knowledge of our members' health status, risk scores and cms practices. we also estimate amounts owed to cms for part d settlements.
we recorded a liability under the terms of such contract provisions of $ 66million and $ 76million at december 31,
2023 and 2022, respectively, to amounts due government agencies.
under this program for our marketplace business, our health plans' composite risk scores are compared with the overall average risk score for the relevant state and market pool. generally, our health plans will make a risk adjustment payment into the pool if their composite risk scores are below the average risk score (risk adjustment payable), and will receive a risk adjustment payment from the pool if their composite risk scores are above the average risk score (risk adjustment receivable). we estimate our ultimate premium based on insurance policy year-
to-date experience, and recognize estimated premiums relating to the risk adjustment program as an adjustment to premium revenue in our consolidated statements of income.as of december 31, 2023, marketplace risk adjustment payables amounted to $ 201million and related receivables amounted to $ 241million, for a net receivable of $
40million. marketplace risk adjustment receivables at december 31, 2023 are net of a $ 41million credit loss allowance resulting from a credit loss recognized in the third quarter of 2023 on 2022 marketplace risk adjustment receivables due to the insolvency of an issuer in the texas risk pool. this charge is included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. as of december 31, 2022, marketplace risk adjustment payables amounted to $ 230million and related receivables amounted to $ 135million, for a net payable of
$ 95million.
other premium adjustments. state medicaid programs periodically adjust premium revenues on a retroactive basis for rate changes and changes in membership and eligibility data. in certain states, adjustments are made based on the health status of our members (as measured through a risk score). in these cases, we adjust our premium revenue in the period in which we determine that the adjustment is probable and reasonably estimable, based on our best estimate of the ultimate premium we expect to realize for the period being adjusted.
quality incentives at many of our health plans, revenue ranging from approximately 1% to 4% of certain health plan premiums is earned only if certain performance measures are met. such performance measures are generally found in our medicaid and mmp contracts. quality incentive premium revenue is recognized when it is earned under such provisions.
reinsurance we bear underwriting and reserving risks associated with our health plan subsidiaries. in certain cases, we limit our risk of significant catastrophic losses by maintaining high deductible reinsurance coverage with a highly-
rated, unaffiliated insurance company (the "third-party reinsurer"). because we remain liable for losses in the event the third-party reinsurer is unable to pay its portion of the losses, we continually monitor the third-party reinsurer's financial condition, including its ability to maintain high credit ratings. intercompany transactions with our captive are eliminated in consolidation.
we report reinsurance premiums as a reduction to premium revenue, while related reinsurance recoveries are reported as a reduction to medical care costs.in certain cases, we participate in state-run reinsurance programs for which no reinsurance premium is paid. reinsurance premiums amounted to $ 11million, $ 2million, and $ 2million for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. reinsurance recoveries amounted to $ 21million, $
35million, and $ 33million for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. reinsurance recoverable of $ 28million, and $ 27million, as of december 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively, is included in
"receivables" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
premium deficiency reserves on loss contracts we assess the profitability of our contracts to determine if it is probable that a loss will be incurred in the future by reviewing current results and forecasts. for purposes of this assessment, contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with our method of acquiring, servicing and measuring the profitability of such contracts. a premium deficiency reserve ("pdr") is recognized if anticipated future medical care and administrative costs exceed anticipated future premium revenue, investment income and reinsurance recoveries.

established when management determines it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.for further discussion and disclosure, see note 12, "income taxes."
taxes based on premiums premium and use tax. certain of our health plans are assessed a tax based on premium revenue collected. the premium revenues we receive from these states include reimbursement for the premium tax assessment. we have reported these taxes on a gross basis, as premium tax revenue and as premium tax expenses in the consolidated statements of income.
concentrations of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments, receivables, and restricted investments. our investments and a portion of our cash equivalents are managed by professional portfolio managers operating under documented investment guidelines. our portfolio managers must obtain our prior approval before selling investments where the loss position of those investments exceeds certain levels. our investments consist primarily of investment-grade debt securities with final maturities of less than 15years, or less than 15years average life for structured securities. restricted investments are invested principally in cash, cash equivalents, u.s. treasury securities, and corporate debt securities. concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited because our payors consist principally of the federal government, and governments of each state in which our health plan subsidiaries operate.
risks and uncertainties our profitability depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage medical care costs. we continually review our medical costs in light of our underlying claims experience and revised actuarial data. however, several factors could adversely affect medical care costs. these factors, which include changes in healthcare practices, inflation, new technologies, major epidemics, natural disasters, and malpractice litigation, are beyond our control and may have an adverse effect on our ability to accurately predict and effectively control medical care costs. costs in excess of those anticipated could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
we operate health plans primarily as a direct contractor with the states, and in los angeles county, california, as a subcontractor to another health plan holding a direct contract with the state. we are therefore dependent upon a relatively small number of contracts to support our revenue. the loss of any one of those contracts could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. in addition, our ability to arrange for the provision of medical services to our members is dependent upon our ability to develop and maintain adequate provider networks. our inability to develop or maintain such networks might, in certain circumstances, have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
significant customers we receive the majority of our revenues under contracts or subcontracts with state medicaid managed care programs, which are considered individual external customers. instances where these contracts were at least 10% of our total premium revenue for the year ended december 31, 2023 were washington with 14.0%, texas with 13.9%, and new york with 11.4%.
recent accounting pronouncements in november 2023, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu")
2023-07, improvements to reportable segment disclosures , which will require disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis for all public entities. the amendments do not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. asu 2023-07 is effective for annual reporting beginning with the fiscal year ending december 31, 2024, and for interim periods thereafter. we are currently evaluating the incremental disclosures that will be required in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements.
in december 2023, the fasb issued asu 2023-09, improvements to income tax disclosures , which will require incremental income tax disclosures on an annual basis for all public entities. the amendments require that public business entities disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items meeting a quantitative threshold. the amendments also require disclosure of income taxes paid to be disaggregated by jurisdiction, and disclosure of income tax expense disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign. asu 2023-09 is effective for annual reporting beginning with the fiscal year ending december 31, 2025. we are currently evaluating the incremental disclosures that will be required in our consolidated financial statements.

other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb (including its emerging issues task force), the american institute of certified public accountants, and the securities and exchange commission ("sec") did not have, nor does management expect such pronouncements to have, a significant impact on our present or future consolidated financial statements.

4. business combinations in 2023, we closed on onebusiness combination in the medicaid and medicare segments, consistent with our growth strategy. for this transaction, we applied the acquisition method of accounting, where the total purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their fair values as of the acquisition date. the pro forma effects of this acquisition for prior periods were not material to our consolidated results of operations. costs to complete acquisitions amounted to $ 4million in the aggregate for the year ended december 31, 2023, and were recorded as "general and administrative expenses" in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
my choice. on september 1, 2023, we closed on our acquisition of my choice wisconsin for preliminary purchase consideration of approximately $ 74million. finalization of purchase price adjustments, as provided in the definitive asset purchase agreement governing the transaction, is expected to occur in the first half of 2024.

goodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the estimated future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. such assets include synergies we expect to achieve as a result of the transaction, such as the use of our existing infrastructure to support the added membership, and future economic benefits arising from the assembled workforce. we allocated goodwill in the amounts of $ 95million to the medicaid segment and $
31million to the medicare segment. the goodwill is entirely deductible for income tax purposes. the following table summarizes the provisional fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, in millions.

bright health medicare. we closed on this acquisition effective january 1, 2024 for $ 441million, which will be part of our medicare segment. the initial accounting for this transaction is incomplete.
5. fair value measurements we consider the carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities to approximate their fair values because of the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization or payment. for our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis, we prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value according to a three-tier fair value hierarchy as follows:
level 1 - observable inputs. level 1 financial instruments are actively traded and therefore the fair value for these securities is based on quoted market prices for identical securities in active markets.
level 2 - directly or indirectly observable inputs. fair value for these investments is determined using a market approach based on quoted prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in inactive markets.
level 3 - unobservable inputs. level 3 financial instruments are valued using unobservable inputs that represent management's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument at the measurement date. as of december 31, 2022, our level 3 financial instruments consisted of contingent consideration liabilities.

our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis at december 31, 2023, were as follows:

"operating activities" in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows.
fair value measurements - disclosure only the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our notes payable are classified as level 2 financial instruments. fair value for these securities is determined using a market approach based on quoted market prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in inactive markets.

in the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, maturities and redemptions of available-for-sale securities amounted to $ 513million, $ 1,069million, and $ 948million, respectively, and sales amounted to $ 259million, $
329million, and $ 381million, respectively. gross realized gains and losses from sales of available-for-sale securities are calculated under the specific identification method and are included in investment income. gross realized investment gains amounted to $ 1million, $ 1million and $ 10million in the years ended december 31, 2023,
2022 and 2021, respectively, and were reclassified into earnings from other comprehensive income on a net-of-tax basis. gross realized investment losses amounted to $ 11million and $ 7million in the years ended december 31, 2023
and 2022, respectively, and were reclassified into earnings from other comprehensive income on a net-of-tax basis.
gross realized investment losses were insignificant in the year ended december 31, 2021.

we have determined that unrealized losses at december 31, 2023 and 2022 primarily resulted from fluctuating interest rates, rather than a deterioration of the creditworthiness of the issuers. therefore, we determined that an allowance for credit losses was not necessary. so long as we maintain the intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity, we are unlikely to experience realized losses. in the event that we dispose of these securities before maturity, we expect that realized losses, if any, will be insignificant.

restricted investments held-to-maturity pursuant to the regulations governing our state health plan subsidiaries, we maintain statutory deposits and deposits required by government authorities primarily in cash, cash equivalents, u.s. treasury securities, and corporate debt securities. we also maintain restricted investments as protection against the insolvency of certain capitated providers. the use of these funds is limited as required by regulations in the various states in which we operate, or as needed in the event of insolvency of capitated providers. therefore, such investments are reported as "restricted investments" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
we have the ability to hold these restricted investments until maturity, and as a result, we would not expect the value of these investments to decline significantly due to a sudden change in market interest rates. our held-to-
maturity restricted investments are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, of which $ 190million will mature in one year or less, $ 65million will mature in one through five years, and $ 6million will mature after five years.

ending balance the amounts presented for "components of medical care costs related to: prior years" represent the amount by which our original estimate of medical claims and benefits payable at the beginning of the year varied from the actual liabilities, based on information (principally the payment of claims) developed since those liabilities were first reported.
our estimates of medical claims and benefits payable recorded at december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 developed favorably by approximately $ 427million, $ 284million and $ 239million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the favorable prior year development recognized in 2023 was primarily due to lower than expected utilization of medical services by our members and improved operating performance, mainly in the medicaid segment. consequently, the ultimate costs recognized in 2023, as claims payments were processed, were lower than our estimates in 2022.
the favorable prior year development recognized in 2022 was primarily due to lower than expected utilization of medical services by our members and improved operating performance, mainly in the medicaid segment. consequently, the ultimate costs recognized in 2022, as claims payments were processed, were lower than our estimates in 2021, which was not discernible until additional information was provided, and as claims payments were processed.
the favorable prior year development recognized in 2021 was primarily due to lower than expected utilization of medical services by our medicaid members, and to a lesser extent our medicare and marketplace members, and improved operating performance. consequently, the ultimate costs recognized in 2021 were lower than our original estimates in 2020, which was not discernible until additional information was provided, and as claims payments were processed.

the following tables provide information about our consolidated incurred and paid claims development as of december
31, 2023, as well as cumulative claims frequency and the total of incurred but not paid claims liabilities. the pattern of incurred and paid claims development is consistent across each of our segments. the cumulative claim frequency is measured by claim event, and includes claims covered under capitated arrangements.

our effective tax rate is based on expected income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. management estimates and judgments are required in determining our effective tax rate. we are routinely under audit by federal, state, or local authorities regarding the timing and amount of deductions, nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions, and compliance with federal, state, foreign, and local tax laws.

at december 31, 2023, we had foreign tax credit carryovers of $ 5million, which expire in 2030.
we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance taking into consideration the ability to carry back and carry forward tax credits and losses, available tax planning strategies and future income, including reversal of temporary differences. we have determined that as of december 31, 2023, $ 24million of deferred tax assets did not satisfy the recognition criteria. therefore, we increased our valuation allowance by $ 6million, from $ 18million at december 31, 2022, to $ 24million as of december 31, 2023.
we recognize tax benefits only if the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained. we are subject to income taxes in the united states, puerto rico, and numerous state jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. during the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. these reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.
the roll forward of our unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

resolution of a state refund claim. the state refund claim will not result in a cash payment for income taxes if our claim is denied.
our continuing practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. amounts accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were insignificant.
we may be subject to examination by the irs for calendar years after 2019. with a few exceptions, which are immaterial in the aggregate, we no longer are subject to state, local, and puerto rico tax examinations for years before 2019.

and extends through december 31, 2024. the exact timing and amount of any repurchase is determined by management based on market conditions and share price, in addition to other factors, and subject to the restrictions relating to volume, price, and timing under applicable law. noshares were purchased in 2023 and through february 9, 2024.

employee stock purchase plans ("espp")
under our espp, eligible employees may purchase common shares at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock on either the first or last trading day of each six-monthoffering period. each participant is limited to a maximum purchase of $ 25,000(as measured by the fair value of the stock acquired) per year through payroll deductions. we estimate the fair value of the stock issued using a standard option pricing model. for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the inputs to this model were as follows: risk-free interest rates of approximately 0.1% to 5.4%; expected volatility of approximately 28% to 54%, dividend yields of 0%, and an average expected life of 0.5years.
14. employee benefit plans we sponsor defined contribution 401(k) plans that cover substantially all employees of our company and its subsidiaries. eligible employees are permitted to contribute up to the maximum amount allowed by law. we match up to the first 4% of compensation contributed by employees. expense recognized in connection with our contributions to the 401(k) plans amounted to $ 54million, $ 45million, and $ 41million in the years ended december 31, 2023,
2022, and 2021, respectively.

we also have a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for certain key employees. under this plan, eligible participants may defer portions of their base salary and bonus to provide tax-deferred growth. the deferrals are distributable based upon termination of employment or other periods, as elected under the plan and were $ 39million and $ 26million as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
15. commitments and contingencies regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions our health plans, which are generally operated by our respective wholly owned subsidiaries in those states in which our health plans operate, are subject to state laws and regulations that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state. the national association of insurance commissioners ("naic"), has adopted model rules which, if implemented by the states, set minimum capitalization requirements for insurance companies, hmos, and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage. the requirements take the form of risk-based capital ("rbc") rules which may vary from state to state. regulators in some states may also enforce capital requirements that require the retention of net worth in excess of amounts formally required by statute or regulation.
all of our health plans except california, florida, massachusetts and new york, are subject to the rbc rules. the minimum statutory capital requirements in these states are based on a percentage of annualized premium revenue, a percentage of annualized health care costs, a percentage of certain liabilities, or other financial ratios. if our california, florida, massachusetts or new york health plans became subject to rbc rules, minimum capital required for those states could increase. our massachusetts health plan maintains a $ 35million performance bond, effective through december 31, 2024, to partially satisfy minimum net worth requirements in that state.
statutes, regulations and informal capital requirements also restrict the timing, payment, and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us as the sole stockholder. to the extent our subsidiaries must comply with these regulations, they may not have the financial flexibility to transfer funds to us. based on current statutes and regulations, the net assets in these subsidiaries, which may not be transferable to us in the form of loans, advances, or cash dividends was approximately $ 3.7billion at december 31, 2023. because of the statutory restrictions that inhibit the ability of our health plans to transfer net assets to us, the amount of retained earnings readily available to pay dividends to our stockholders is generally limited to cash, cash equivalents and investments held by the parent company-molina healthcare, inc. such cash, cash equivalents and investments amounted to $ 742million and $ 375million as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
as of december 31, 2023, our health plans had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately $
4.1billion, which was in excess of the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately $
2.3billion. we have the ability and commitment to provide additional capital to each of our health plans when necessary to ensure that statutory capital and surplus continues to meet regulatory requirements.
legal proceedings the healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations of federal, state, and local governments, as well as various contractual provisions, governing our operations. compliance with these laws, regulations, and contractual provisions can be subject to government audit, review, and interpretation, as well as regulatory actions. penalties associated with violations of these laws, regulations, and contractual provisions can include significant fines and penalties, temporary or permanent exclusion from participating in publicly funded programs, a limitation on our ability to market or sell products, the repayment of previously billed and collected revenues, and reputational damage.
we are involved in legal actions in the ordinary course of business including, but not limited to, various employment claims, vendor disputes and provider claims. some of these legal actions seek monetary damages, including claims for punitive damages, which may not be covered by insurance. we review legal matters and update our estimates, or range of estimates, of reasonably possible losses and related disclosures, as necessary. we have accrued liabilities for legal matters for which we deem the loss to be both probable and reasonably estimable.
these liability estimates could change as a result of further developments. the outcome of these legal actions are inherently uncertain. an adverse determination in one or more of these pending matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

health and family services, and all of the five winning bidder health plans, including our kentucky health plan. on september 9, 2022, the kentucky court of appeals ruled that, with regard to the earlier circuit court ruling granting anthem relief, the circuit court should not have invalidated the 2020 procurement and thus should not have awarded a contract to anthem. anthem sought discretionary review by the kentucky supreme court ("ksc") of the ruling by the court of appeals. on april 19, 2023, ksc granted anthem's request for discretionary review and ordered legal briefing, which the parties completed in september 2023. ksc has scheduled oral arguments on march 7,
2024. pending further ksc order, our kentucky health plan will continue to operate for the foreseeable future under its current medicaid contract. at this time, the company cannot predict the outcome, or provide a reasonable estimate or range of estimates of the possible outcome or loss, if any, in this matter.
puerto rico. on august 13, 2021, molina healthcare of puerto rico, inc. ("mhpr") filed a complaint with the commonwealth of puerto rico, court of first instance, san juan (state court) asserting, among other claims, breach of contract against puerto rico health insurance administration ("ases"). on september 13, 2021, ases filed a counterclaim and a third-party complaint against mhpr and the company. the parties are engaged in settlement conversations. a status hearing was held on september 28, 2023, in which ases and molina informed the court of the ongoing settlement conversations. on january 15, 2024, ases and molina informed the court that they had reached an agreement in principle, and the court has scheduled a status conference on march 5, 2024 . t he company cannot predict the outcome, or provide a reasonable estimate or range of estimates of the possible outcome or loss, if any, in this matter.
texas qui tam litigation. on may 7, 2013, a relator filed under seal a qui tam action in texas state court against molina healthcare, inc. and molina healthcare of texas, inc., asserting claims under the texas medicaid fraud prevention act ("tmfpa") on behalf of the state of texas. the original petition alleged that molina healthcare of texas knowingly failed to assess its star+plus members in accordance with the terms of its medicaid contract with the state and made false statements to the state concerning those assessments that permitted molina healthcare of texas to receive from the state unnecessary payments. as required by the tmfpa, the original petition was filed in camera and under seal, and without molina's awareness, to permit the state to decide whether to intervene and assume responsibility for prosecuting the lawsuit. in 2019, the state declined to intervene. in june 2019, as a result of the state's election to decline intervention, the trial court unsealed the original petition, at which time molina became aware of the lawsuit. the relator amended her original petition and served molina in july 2019.
in september 2019, molina filed a motion to dismiss the relator's claims under the texas citizens participation act. after the trial court denied the motion, and following extended appellate proceedings which automatically stayed all trial court proceedings, discovery in the lawsuit commenced in late 2021. the relator's third amended petition was filed on january 19, 2024. the petition alleges that, during the periods in question some ten years ago, molina failed to assess star+plus members for personal attendant services, failed to provide those members with contractually required health care benefits, and misrepresented to the state molina's capacity to perform the assessments and the status of the assessments. based on these allegations, the relator contends that molina is liable to the state under the tmfpa for statutorily defined civil remedies, disgorgement of previous capitation payments, and interest. molina denies the relator's allegations as well as any liability in the lawsuit, and intends to defend against the relator's allegations vigorously. the lawsuit is currently in the discovery phase, with trial set before the texas district court, travis county in late september 2024. the case remains subject to significant additional proceedings, and due to numerous factors of uncertainty presented in the case, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate, or range of estimates, with regard to the ultimate outcome of this matter.
professional liability insurance we carry medical professional liability insurance for healthcare services rendered in our primary care locations and throughout the communities we serve. in addition, we carry managed care errors and omissions insurance for all managed care services that we provide.
16. segments we currently have fourreportable segments consisting of: 1) medicaid; 2) medicare; 3) marketplace; and 4) other.
our reportable segments are consistent with how we currently manage the business and view the markets we serve.
the medicaid, medicare, and marketplace segments represent the government-funded or sponsored programs under which we offer managed healthcare services. the other segment, which is insignificant to our consolidated results of operations, includes long-term services and supports consultative services in wisconsin.

the key metrics used to assess the performance of our medicaid, medicare, and marketplace segments are premium revenue, medical margin and medical care ratio ("mcr"). mcr represents the amount of medical care costs as a percentage of premium revenue. therefore, the underlying medical margin, or the amount earned by the medicaid, medicare, and marketplace segments after medical costs are deducted from premium revenue, represents the most important measure of earnings reviewed by management, and is used by our chief executive officer to review results, assess performance, and allocate resources. the key metric used to assess the performance of our other segment is service margin. the service margin is equal to service revenue minus cost of service revenue. we do not report total assets by segment since this is not a metric used to assess segment performance or allocate resources.
the following table presents total revenue by segment. inter-segment revenue was insignificant for all periods presented.

management's evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures we maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in rule 13a-15(e) and rule 15d-15(e) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act"). in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of any possible controls and procedures.
under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this form 10-k pursuant to rule 13a-15(b) and rule 15d-15(b) of the exchange act. based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31, 2023, at the reasonable assurance level. in addition, management concluded that our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k are fairly stated in all material respects in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") for each of the periods presented herein.
management's report on internal control over financial reporting management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in rule 13a-15(f) under the exchange act. our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements prepared for external purposes in accordance with gaap. because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
management concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31,
2023, based on criteria described in internal control-integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission ("coso").
on september 1, 2023, we completed our acquisition of my choice wisconsin ("my choice"). we are in the process of evaluating the existing controls and procedures of my choice, and integrating them into our internal controls over financial reporting. in accordance with sec staff guidance permitting a company to exclude an acquired business from management's assessment of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the year in which the acquisition is completed, we have excluded the business that we acquired in the my choice acquisition from our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2023. the business that we acquired in the my choice acquisition constituted 1% of both our total and net assets, as of december 31,
2023, and 1% of both our revenues and net income, for the year ended december 31, 2023. the scope of management's assessment of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31, 2023, includes all of our consolidated operations except for those disclosure controls and procedures of my choice that are subsumed by internal control over financial reporting.
ernst & young, llp, the independent registered public accounting firm who audited our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k, has issued a report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.
changes in internal control over financial reporting there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in rule 13a-15(f) of the exchange act) during the quarter ended december 31, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

report of independent registered public accounting firm to the stockholders and the board of directors of molina healthcare, inc.
opinion on internal control over financial reporting we have audited molina healthcare, inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2023, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework) (the "coso criteria"). in our opinion, molina healthcare, inc. (the "company") maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2023, based on the coso criteria.
as indicated in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of my choice wisconsin, which is included in the 2023 consolidated financial statements of the company and constituted 1% of both total and net assets, respectively, as of december 31, 2023 and 1% of both revenues and net income, respectively, for the year then ended. our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of my choice wisconsin.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) ("pcaob"), the consolidated balance sheets of the company as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated february 13, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
basis for opinion the company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

medicaid key factors affecting results for this segment include:
• our growth initiatives, including acquisitions and expansion into new states, drove an increase in member months during the year, despite the impact of redeterminations, and changes in membership mix;
• impact of redetermination, including the loss of approximately 500,000 members, and a moderate impact from the effect of acuity shifts, net of the beneficial impact of risk corridors; and
• improved operating performance, including medical cost management, and prospective and retrospective rates.
medicaid premium revenue increased $1.5 billion, or 6% in 2023, when compared with 2022. the increase was mainly due to the impact of our growth initiatives, changes in business and membership mix, and the beneficial impact of risk corridors in several states. we benefited from membership growth related to the suspension of redeterminations through the end of the first quarter of 2023. additionally, membership increased due to the agewell acquisition that closed in the fourth quarter of 2022, the commencement of the iowa medicaid contract in july 2023, and the impact from the my choice wisconsin acquisition that closed on september 1, 2023. these increases were partially offset by the net membership impact of redetermination. by the end of the third quarter of 2023, all states within our medicaid footprint had begun disenrolling members, which is expected to continue through the first half of
2024.
the medical margin of our medicaid program decreased $8 million in 2023, when compared with 2022. the year-over-
year change was driven by an increase in mcr, partially offset by the increased premium revenues discussed above.
the medicaid mcr increased 70 basis points to 88.7% in 2023, from 88.0% in 2022. the increase was mainly attributable to changes in business and membership mix, including acquisitions and commencement of the iowa contract, and a modest acuity impact from redetermination, partially offset by prospective and retrospective rates, the beneficial impact of risk corridor offsets in several states, and improved operating performance. the medicaid mcr for the year ended december 31, 2023 is consistent with our long-term target range.
medicare key factors affecting results for this segment include:
• increased utilization of supplemental benefits, in-home services, and high-cost drugs;
• our continued expansion in mapd and d-snp membership; and
• the impact of lower risk-adjusted premiums associated with the new mapd and d-snp members, partially offset by higher risk scores on renewing members.
medicare premium revenue increased $384 million, or 10%, in 2023 compared to 2022. the increase was primarily due to the impact of mapd and d-snp membership expansion, including organic membership growth in existing states and the closing of my choice wisconsin on september 1, 2023.
the medical margin for medicare decreased $49 million in 2023 compared to 2022. the year-over-year decrease was mainly due to the increase in mcr discussed below, partially offset by the increase in the premium revenues.

risk scores on renewing members that more closely reflect the acuity of our membership. the medicare mcr for the year ended december 31, 2023 is above our long-term target range.
marketplace key factors affecting results for this segment include:
• execution of our product and pricing strategy, which resulted in an overall reduction in membership, repositioning in the metallic tier membership mix, and returning the business to target margins; and
• achievement of member risk scores and associated risk-adjusted premium that are commensurate with the health status, or acuity, of our marketplace members.
marketplace premium revenue decreased $238 million in 2023 compared to 2022. the decrease was mainly due to an expected decrease in membership in line with our product and pricing strategy, partially offset by an increase in premium revenue pmpm. our marketplace membership as of december 31, 2023, amounted to 281,000 members, representing a decrease of 67,000 members compared to december 31, 2022. the increase in premium revenue pmpm was due to higher silver metal tier product mix consistent with the product and pricing strategy and higher risk adjustment premiums.
the marketplace medical margin increased $209 million in 2023, primarily due to the decrease in mcr discussed below, partially offset by the decrease in membership and premiums.
the marketplace mcr decreased to 75.3% in 2023, compared to 87.2% in 2022, or 1,190 basis points. the decrease in
2023 resulted mainly from our product and pricing strategy to achieve our target margins, including higher risk adjustment premium on silver metal tier and renewal members, commensurate with the acuity profile of those members.
in addition, the comparison reflects a favorable change in the 2022 risk adjustment payable recognized in 2023
compared to an unfavorable change in the 2021 risk adjustment payable recognized in 2022. silver metal tier products incur less mcr seasonality than bronze metal tier products due to lower deductibles. these impacts were partially offset by changes in membership mix discussed above. our 2023 marketplace mcr was well below our long-
term target range.
other the other segment includes service revenues and costs associated with the long-term services and supports consultative services we provide in wisconsin, and also includes certain corporate amounts not allocated to the medicaid, medicare, or marketplace segments. such amounts were immaterial to our consolidated results of operations for 2023 and 2022.
liquidity, financial condition and capital resources liquidity we manage our cash, investments, and capital structure to meet the short- and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility. we forecast, analyze, and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy.
we maintain liquidity at two levels: 1) the regulated health plan subsidiaries; and 2) the parent company.
our regulated health plan subsidiaries' primary liquidity requirements include payment of medical claims and other health care services; payment of certain settlements with our state and federal customers, such as minimum medical loss ratio and risk corridors and marketplace risk transfers on behalf of cms; general and administrative costs directly incurred or paid through an administrative services agreement to the parent company; and federal tax payments to the parent company under an intercompany tax sharing agreement. our regulated health plan subsidiaries meet their liquidity needs by generating cash flows from operating activities, primarily from premium revenue; cash flows from investing activities, including investment income and sales of investments; and capital contributions received from our parent company.
our regulated health plan subsidiaries are each subject to applicable state regulations that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of capital and surplus. we continue to maintain levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our regulated health plan subsidiaries that we believe are appropriate. see further discussion under "regulatory capital and dividend restrictions" below. when available and as permitted by applicable regulations, cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated health plan subsidiaries is generally paid in the form of dividends to our parent company to be used for general corporate purposes. the regulated health plan subsidiaries paid dividends to the parent company amounting to $705 million in 2023 and $668 million in 2022.

parent company liquidity requirements generally consist of payment of administrative costs not directly incurred by our regulated operations, including, but not limited to, staffing costs, lease payments, branding and certain information technology services; capital contributions paid to our regulated health plan subsidiaries, including funding for newer health plans; capital expenditures; debt service; funding for common stock purchases, acquisitions and other growth-related activities; and federal tax payments. the parent company contributed capital of $221 million and $159 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, to our regulated health plan subsidiaries to satisfy statutory capital and surplus requirements. the higher contributions in 2023 were mainly attributed to fund growth in our wisconsin and iowa health plans. our parent company normally meets its liquidity requirements from administrative services fees earned under administrative services agreements; dividends received from our regulated subsidiaries; federal tax payments collected from the regulated subsidiaries; proceeds received from the issuance of debt and equity securities; and cash flows from investing activities, including investment income and sales of investments.
cash, cash equivalents and investments at the parent company amounted to $742 million and $375 million as of december 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. the increase in 2023 was primarily due to the dividends received from our regulated health plan subsidiaries, partially offset by the timing of corporate payments, capital contributions to regulated health plan subsidiaries and net cash paid for acquisitions. on january 1, 2024, we closed on our acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of brand new day and central health plan of california for $441 million. see notes to consolidated financial statements, note 4, "business combinations," for further information.
investments after considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short-term obligations in longer term, investment-grade, and marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return. these investments are made pursuant to board-approved investment policies which conform to applicable state laws and regulations.
our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity, preserve capital, and maximize total return on invested assets, all in a manner consistent with state requirements that prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest. these investment policies require that our investments have final maturities of less than
15 years, or less than 15 years average life for structured securities. professional portfolio managers operating under documented guidelines manage our investments and a portion of our cash equivalents. our portfolio managers must obtain our prior approval before selling investments where the loss position of those investments exceeds certain levels.
the overall rating of our portfolio is a+. our investment policy has directives in conjunction with state guidelines to minimize risks and exposures in volatile markets. additionally, our portfolio managers assist us in navigating the current volatility in the capital markets.
our restricted investments are invested principally in cash, cash equivalents, u.s. treasury securities, and corporate debt securities; we have the ability to hold such restricted investments until maturity. all of our unrestricted investments are classified as current assets.
cash flow activities our cash flows are summarized as follows:

operating activities we typically receive capitation payments monthly, in advance of payments for medical claims; however, government payors may adjust their payment schedules, positively or negatively impacting our reported cash flows from operating activities in any given period. for example, government payors may delay our premium payments, or they may prepay the following month's premium payment.
net cash provided by operations was $1,662 million in 2023, compared with $773 million in 2022. the $889 million increase in 2023 cash flow was due to the growth in operations and net earnings from organic and new rfp starts and acquisitions, accompanied by the net impact of timing differences in government receivables and payables.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $744 million in 2023, compared with $790 million in 2022. the change in cash flow was primarily due to the net activity of proceeds and purchases of investments, which were net purchases of $661 million in 2023 and net purchases of $515 million in 2022. in 2023 and 2022, net cash outflow related to acquisitions was $3 million and $134 million, respectively.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was $58 million in 2023, compared with $441 million in 2022, an increase in year-over-year cash flow of $383 million. in 2023, cash outflows included $60 million for common stock withheld to settle employee tax obligations. in 2022, cash outflows included common stock purchases of $400 million and $54
million for common stock withheld to settle employee tax obligations. additionally, we paid $20 million in 2022 to settle contingent consideration liabilities.
financial condition we believe that our cash resources, borrowing capacity available under our credit agreement as discussed further below in "future sources and uses of liquidity-future sources," and internally generated funds will be sufficient to support our operations, regulatory requirements, debt repayment obligations and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.
on a consolidated basis, as of december 31, 2023, our working capital was $4.4 billion compared with $3.2 billion as of december 31, 2022. at december 31, 2023, our cash and investments amounted to $9.4 billion, compared with
$7.7 billion of cash and investments at december 31, 2022. a significant portion of our portfolio is held in cash and cash equivalents and we do not anticipate the fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position since we intend to hold our securities to maturity.
net unrealized losses on our investments classified as current and available for sale decreased to $108 million at december 31, 2023 compared to $210 million at december 31, 2022. we have determined that the unrealized losses primarily resulted from fluctuating interest rates, rather than a deterioration of the creditworthiness of the issuers.
because of the statutory restrictions that inhibit the ability of our health plan subsidiaries to transfer net assets to us, the amount of retained earnings readily available to pay dividends to our stockholders is generally limited to cash, cash equivalents and investments held by our unregulated parent. for more information, see the
"liquidity" discussion presented above.
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions each of our regulated, wholly owned subsidiaries must maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital determined by statute or regulations. such statutes, regulations and capital requirements also restrict the timing, payment and amount of dividends and other distributions, loans or advances that may be paid to us as the sole stockholder. to the extent our subsidiaries must comply with these regulations, they may not have the financial flexibility to transfer funds to us. based upon current statutes and regulations, the minimum capital and surplus requirement for these subsidiaries was estimated to be approximately $2.3 billion at both december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022.
the aggregate capital and surplus of our wholly owned subsidiaries was in excess of these minimum capital requirements as of both dates.
under applicable regulatory requirements, the amount of dividends that may be paid by our wholly owned subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities as of december 31, 2023, was approximately $380 million in the aggregate. the subsidiaries may pay dividends over this amount, but only after approval is granted by the regulatory authorities.

based on our cash and investments balances as of december 31, 2023, management believes that our regulated wholly owned subsidiaries remain well capitalized and exceed their regulatory minimum requirements. we have the ability, and have committed to provide, additional capital to each of our health plans as necessary to ensure compliance with minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements.
capital structure in september 2023, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $750 million of our common stock. this new program supersedes the stock purchase program previously approved by our board of directors in november 2022
and extends through december 31, 2024.
as debt held by the parent company comes due, we typically engage in a new private offering of debt to retire and replace the prior issuance. for several years we saw a continued decline in interest rates, which benefited our overall cost of capital during that time. however, interest rates have increased since we issued our 3.875% notes due 2032 in 2021. accordingly, future refinancing may occur at a higher rate than those we have achieved historically. this would increase our cost of capital in the future or may cause us to pursue alternative financing sources, should the need arise.
we are not a party to any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
debt ratings each of our senior notes is rated "bb-" by standard & poor's, and "ba3" by moody's investor service, inc. a downgrade in our ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and increase our borrowing costs.
financial covenants the credit agreement contains customary non-financial and financial covenants, including a net leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. such ratios are computed as defined by the terms of the credit agreement.
in addition, the indentures governing each of our outstanding senior notes contain cross-default provisions that are triggered upon default by us or any of our subsidiaries on any indebtedness in excess of the amount specified in the applicable indenture. as of december 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants under the credit agreement and other long-term debt.
future sources and uses of liquidity future sources our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from premium revenue, which is generally received a short time before related healthcare services are paid. premium revenue is our primary source of liquidity. thus, any decline in the receipt of premium revenue, and our profitability, could have a negative impact on our liquidity.
regulatory developments . excluding acquisitions and our exit from puerto rico, we estimate we added approximately one million new medicaid members since march 31, 2020, when we first began to report on the impacts of the pandemic. we believe this membership increase was mainly due to the suspension of redeterminations for medicaid eligibility. the consolidated appropriations act of 2023 authorized states to resume redeterminations and terminate coverage for ineligible enrollees starting on april 1, 2023, irrespective of the status of the phe. consequently, during the third quarter of 2023, all states in which we operate had begun disenrolling members. in 2023, we estimate we lost approximately 500,000 members due to redeterminations, offset by new enrollment and expect to lose an additional 100,000 members in 2024. given the high number of procedural terminations and increasing interventions by cms and various states, we expect reconnects will likely continue, decreasing currently reported losses. although the medical cost profile of members who have been disenrolled is more favorable than the medicaid segment average, when combined with the beneficial impact of corridor offsets in several states, our medicaid mcr for the year ended december 31, 2023 was within our expectations. based on the experience to date, we expect that we will ultimately retain approximately 40% of the membership gained since march 31, 2020.
dividends from subsidiaries. when available and as permitted by applicable regulations, cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated health plans is generally paid in the form of dividends to our unregulated parent company to be used for general corporate purposes. for more information on our regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions, refer to notes to consolidated financial statements, note 15, "commitments and contingencies-regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions," and note 17, "condensed financial information of registrant-note c - dividends and capital contributions."

credit agreement borrowing capacity. as of december 31, 2023, we had available borrowing capacity of $1 billion under the credit facility. in addition, the credit agreement provides for a $15 million swingline sub-facility and a $100 million letter of credit sub-facility, as well as incremental term loans available to finance certain acquisitions up to $500 million, plus an unlimited amount of such term loans as long as we maintain a minimum consolidated net leverage ratio. see further discussion in the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 11,
"debt."
future uses common stock purchases. in september 2023, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $750 million of our common stock. this new program supersedes the stock purchase program previously approved by our board of directors in november 2022 and extends through december 31, 2024. the exact timing and amount of any repurchase is determined by management based on market conditions and share price, in addition to other factors, and subject to the restrictions relating to volume, price, and timing under applicable law. as of february 13, 2024, $750 million remained available to purchase our common stock under this program through december 31, 2024. see further information in the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 13, "stockholders' equity."
acquisitions . we have a disciplined and steady approach to growth. organic growth, which includes leveraging our existing health plan portfolio and winning new territories, is our highest priority. in addition to organic growth, we will consider targeted acquisitions that are a strategic fit that we believe will leverage operational synergies, and lead to incremental earnings accretion. for further information on our acquisitions, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 4, "business combinations."
on january 1, 2024, we closed on our acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of brand new day and central health plan of california for $441 million.
regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions. we have the ability, and have committed to provide, additional capital to each of our health plans as necessary to ensure compliance with minimum statutory capital requirements.
the molina healthcare charitable foundation. in 2020, we announced our commitment of $150 million to fund the molina healthcare charitable foundation (the "foundation"), an independent not-for-profit charitable foundation. we have contributed $20 million to the foundation on a cumulative basis as of december 31, 2023. in the first three years of its existence, our charitable foundation funded nearly 700 grants to local community organizations in 25
states that address social determinants of health, disaster relief, mental health, maternal child health and other health-related concerns afflicting our communities in need.
contractual obligations. we are party to various contractual obligations that we will be required to satisfy over the short and long term. the majority are discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements and primarily include the following:
• medical claims and benefits payable. see notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies," and note 10, "medical claims and benefits payable," for further detail.
• amounts due government agencies. see notes to consolidated financial statements, notes 2, "significant accounting policies," for further detail.
• debt obligations. see notes to consolidated financial statements, note 11, "debt," for further detail of our long-term debt and the timing of expected future payments. interest payments are paid semi-annually.
• leases. see notes to consolidated financial statements, note 8, "leases," for further detail of our finance and operating lease obligations and the timing of expected future payments.
some items are based on management's estimates and assumptions about obligations, including duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties, and other factors. because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary. additionally, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring services used in our operations. however, we believe these other agreements do not contain material non-cancelable commitments.
critical accounting estimates when we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we use estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures. actual results could differ from these estimates, and some differences could be material.
our most significant accounting estimates, which include a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity, include the following:

• medical costs, claims and benefits payable. see discussion below, and refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies," and note 10, "medical claims and benefits payable"
for more information.
• premium revenue recognition and amounts due government agencies: risk adjustment. for a discussion of this topic, including amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies."
• business combinations, and goodwill and intangible assets, net. for a comprehensive discussion of this topic, including amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies," note 4, "business combinations," and note 9, "goodwill and intangible assets, net."
medical care costs, medical claims and benefits payable medical care costs are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include fee-for-service claims, pharmacy benefits, capitation payments to providers, and various other medically-related costs. under fee-for-
service claims arrangements with providers, we retain the financial responsibility for medical care provided and incur costs based on actual utilization of hospital and physician services. such medical care costs include amounts paid by us as well as estimated medical claims and benefits payable for costs that were incurred but not paid as of the reporting date ("ibnp"). pharmacy benefits represent payments for members' prescription drug costs, net of rebates from drug manufacturers. we estimate pharmacy rebates based on historical and current utilization of prescription drugs and contractual provisions. capitation payments represent monthly contractual fees paid to providers, who are responsible for providing medical care to members, which could include medical or ancillary costs like dental, vision and other supplemental health benefits. such capitation costs are fixed in advance of the periods covered and are not subject to significant accounting estimates. other medical care costs include all medically-related administrative costs, amounts due to providers pursuant to risk-sharing or other incentive arrangements, provider claims, and other healthcare expenses. examples of medically-related administrative costs include expenses relating to health education, quality assurance, case management, care coordination, disease management, and 24-hour on-call nurses. additionally, we include an estimate for the cost of settling claims incurred through the reporting date in our medical claims and benefits payable liability.
the following table illustrates consolidated medical care costs by type for the periods indicated:

medical claims and benefits payable consist mainly of fee-for-service ibnp, unpaid pharmacy claims, capitation costs, other medical costs, including amounts payable to providers pursuant to risk-sharing or other incentive arrangements and amounts payable to providers on behalf of certain state agencies for certain state assessments in which we assume no financial risk. ibnp includes the costs of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date which have been reported to us, and our best estimate of the cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us. when more complete claims payment information and healthcare cost trend data becomes available, we reflect changes in these estimates as an increase or decrease to medical care costs in the consolidated results of operations in the period in which they are determined.

membership, product mix, seasonality, benefit changes or changes in fee schedules, provider contract changes, prior authorizations and the incidence of catastrophic or pandemic cases.
for claims incurred more than three months before the financial statement date, we mainly use estimated completion factors to estimate the ultimate cost of those claims. completion factors measure the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will ultimately be paid for a given month of service based on historical claims payment patterns. we analyze historical claims payment patterns by comparing claim incurred dates to claim payment dates to estimate completion factors. the estimated completion factors are then applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claims cost for a given month's incurred claim activity. the difference between the estimated ultimate claims cost and the claims paid through the financial statement date represents our estimate of claims remaining to be paid as of the financial statement date and is included in our ibnp liability .
for claims incurred within three months before the financial statement date, actual claims paid are a less reliable measure of our ultimate cost since a large portion of medical claims are not submitted to us until several months after services have been submitted. accordingly, we estimate our ibnp liability for claims incurred during these months based on a blend of estimated completion factors and assumed medical care cost trend. the assumed medical care cost trend represents the year-over-year change in per-member per-month medical care costs, which can be affected by many factors including, but not limited to, our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized, mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles, changes in medical practices, changes in member demographics, catastrophes and epidemics , and other relevant factors.
actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that our overall best estimate of the ibnp liability has a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient, where the liability is sufficient to account for moderately adverse conditions. accordingly, our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate including a provision for moderately adverse conditions for each current period. this provision is reported as part of "components of medical care costs related to: current year" in the table presented in note 10, "medical claims and benefits payable." adverse conditions are situations that may cause actual claims to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate, such as changes in the magnitude or severity of claims, uncertainties related to our entry into new geographical markets or provision of services to new populations, changes in state-controlled fee schedules, and modifications or upgrades to our claims processing systems and practices. therefore, in many situations, the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice.
when subsequent actual claims payments are less than we estimated, we recognize a benefit for favorable prior period development that is reported as part of "components of medical care costs related to: prior years" in the table presented in note 10. assuming stability in the size of our membership, the use of this consistent methodology, during any given period, usually results in the replenishment of reserves at a level that generally offsets the benefit of favorable prior period development in that period. in the case of material growth or decline of membership, replenishment can exceed or fall short of the favorable development, assuming all other factors remain unchanged.
because of the significant degree of judgment involved in estimation of our ibnp liability, there is considerable variability and uncertainty inherent in such estimates. the following table reflects the hypothetical change in our estimate of claims liability as of december 31, 2023 that would result if we change our completion factors for the fourth through the twelfth months preceding december 31, 2023, by the percentages indicated. a reduction in the completion factor results in an increase in medical claims liabilities. dollar amounts are in millions.

there are many related factors working in conjunction with one another that determine the accuracy of our estimates, some of which are qualitative in nature rather than quantitative. therefore, we are seldom able to quantify the impact that any single factor has on a change in estimate. given the variability inherent in the reserving process, we will only be able to identify specific factors if they represent a significant departure from expectations. as a result, we do not expect to be able to fully quantify the impact of individual factors on changes in estimates.
recently issued accounting standards refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2, "significant accounting policies," for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that affect us.

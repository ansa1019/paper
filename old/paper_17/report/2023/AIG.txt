aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 1a | risk factors risk factors investing in aig involves risk. in deciding whether to invest in aig, you should carefully consider the following risk factors. any of these risk factors could have a significant or material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. they could also cause significant fluctuations and volatility in the trading price of our securities. readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect aig. these factors should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and the other reports and materials filed by us with the sec. further, many of these risks are interrelated and could occur under similar business and economic conditions, and the occurrence of certain of them may in turn cause the emergence or exacerbate the effect of others. such a combination could materially increase the severity of the impact of these risks on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity above and beyond a risk's singular impact.
market conditions deterioration of economic conditions, geopolitical tensions, changes in market conditions or weakening in global capital markets may materially affect our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
our businesses are highly dependent on global economic and market conditions. weaknesses in economic conditions, including a recessionary environment, poor capital markets performance and market volatility have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, among other consequences, a poor operating environment, erosion of consumer and investor confidence, reduced business volumes, deteriorating liquidity, declines in asset valuations and impacts on policyholder behavior that could influence reserve valuations.
key ways in which we have in the past been, and could in the future be, negatively affected by economic conditions include:
•increases in policy withdrawals, lapses, surrenders and cancellations and other impacts from changes in policyholder behavior compared to that assumed in pricing;
•increased loss payments and loss costs due to inflation;
•increased challenges to insurance policy terms and conditions, such as standard exclusions;
•increases in costs associated with third-party reinsurance, or decreased ability to obtain reinsurance on acceptable terms;
•the increased likelihood of, or increased magnitude of, asset impairments caused by market fluctuations, deterioration in collateral values or credit deterioration of borrowers; and
•reduced premium and deposits.
adverse economic conditions may result from a variety of factors including domestic and global economic and political developments, including elevated interest rates, plateauing or decreasing economic growth and business activity, recessions, social inflation, inflationary or deflationary pressures in developed economies, including the united states, civil unrest, pandemics, geopolitical tensions, foreign investment restrictions, or military action, such as the armed conflict between ukraine and russia and corresponding sanctions imposed by the united states and other countries or the conflict in israel and the surrounding areas, and new or evolving legal and regulatory requirements on business investment, hiring, migration, labor supply and global supply chains.
these and other market, economic, regulatory and political factors, including the prolonged effects of elevated inflation, turmoil in the global banking sector and related macroeconomic uncertainty, and domestic and international political tension, including any potential u.s. government shutdown, have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition, capital and liquidity in many ways, including:
•lower levels of consumer demand for and ability to afford our products and commercial business activities that have decreased and may continue to decrease revenues and profitability and thus impair goodwill, deferred tax assets or other long-term assets;
•increased credit impairments, downgrades and losses across single or numerous asset classes due to lower collateral values or deteriorating cash flow and profitability by borrowers that could lead to higher defaults on the company's investment portfolio, especially in geographic, industry or investment sectors where the company has higher concentrations of exposure, such as real estate related borrowings, and widening of credit spreads that could reduce investment asset valuations, decrease fee income and increase statutory capital requirements;
•increased market volatility and uncertainty that could decrease liquidity, increase borrowing costs and limit access to capital markets;
•the reduction of investment income generated by our investment portfolio;
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 1a | risk factors
•disruption to our business operations in countries experiencing geopolitical tensions as well as increased costs associated with meeting customer needs in such regions;
•increased costs related to our direct and third-party support services, labor and financing, increased credit risk and decreased sales as a result of inflationary pressures; and
•limitations on business activities and increased compliance risks with respect to economic sanctions regulations relating to jurisdictions in which our businesses operate or we have operations.
in addition, if our investment managers, including blackstone inc. (blackstone) and blackrock, inc. (blackrock), or any other investment managers we engage, fail to react appropriately to difficult market or economic conditions, our investment portfolio could incur material losses.
changes in interest rates have materially and adversely affected and may continue to materially and adversely affect our profitability.
global interest rates increased steadily in 2022 and 2023, including in the united states, and in some cases, have risen rapidly after an extended period at or near historic lows.
we are exposed primarily to the following risks arising from or exacerbated by fluctuations in interest rates:
•mismatch between the expected duration of our liabilities and our assets;
•impairment to our ability to earn the returns or spreads assumed in the pricing and the reserving for our products;
•changes in certain statutory reserve or capital requirements that are based on formulas or models that consider interest rates or prescribed interest rates, such as cash flow testing reserves;
•changes in the costs of derivatives we use for hedging or increases in the volume of hedging we do;
•an increase in policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals as interest rates rise;
•loss from reduced fee income, and changes in the fair values of market risk benefits (mrbs) and embedded derivatives;
•the reinvestment risk associated with more prepayments on mortgage-backed securities and other fixed income securities in decreasing interest rate environments and fewer prepayments in increasing interest rate environments;
•volatility in our generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) results of operations driven by interest rate-related components of liabilities and equity market-related components of optional guaranteed benefits and the cost of associated hedges in low interest rate environments; and
•increased financing and refinancing costs, in particular with respect to our corporate debt instruments.
changes in interest rates have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio. for example, increases in interest rates have impacted, and may continue to impact, our investment portfolio by decreasing the estimated fair values of the fixed income securities that constitute a substantial portion of our investment portfolio as well as the alternative investments in our investment portfolio. this in turn has increased and could continue to increase the unrealized loss positions in our portfolio and adversely affect our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, thereby materially and adversely affecting our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. furthermore, changes in interest rates and credit spreads have led to decreasing the average account value of our separate accounts thereby negatively impacting the fee income we earn.
in periods of rapidly increasing interest rates or sustained periods of elevated interest rates, such as the current interest rate environment, we may not be able to purchase, in a timely manner, the investments in our general account with yields sufficient to fund the higher crediting rates necessary to keep interest rate sensitive products that we offer competitive. therefore, we may need to accept a lower investment spread and, thus, lower profitability, or face a decline in sales and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals also tend to increase as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns in higher interest rate environments. these impacts may continue to result in significant cash outflows requiring that we sell investments at a time when the prices of those investments are adversely affected by interest rate volatility, which could result in realized investment losses when selling assets in an unrealized loss position.
conversely, the sustained low interest rates we experienced through early 2022 negatively affected and, should a low interest rate environment return, could in the future negatively affect the performance of our investments and reduce the level of investment income earned on our investment portfolios, resulting in net investment spread compression. we experience lower investment income as well as lower sales of new life and retirement insurance products, including interest rate sensitive products, and policies when a low or declining u.s. interest rate environment persists, and/or interest rates turn negative, and these effects can persist so long as the investments purchased and products issued remain outstanding, even after rates have risen. we may also experience lower investment income if we are forced to reinvest cash flows from investments at rates below the average yield of our existing portfolios. due to practical and capital markets limitations, we have in the past not been and may in the future not be able to fully mitigate our interest rate risk by matching exposure of our assets relative to our liabilities. low levels of interest rates have in the past and could in the future continue to impair our ability to earn the returns assumed in the pricing and the reserving for our products at the time they were sold and issued.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 1a | risk factors in addition, fluctuations in interest rates may expose us to the risk of increases in certain statutory reserve requirements that are based on formulas or models that consider interest rates, which would reduce statutory capital, and increases in capital requirements and the amount of assets we must maintain to support statutory reserves, which would reduce surplus.
the primary source of our exposure to credit spreads is in the value of our fixed income securities. if credit spreads widen significantly, we could be exposed to higher levels of defaults and impairments. if credit spreads tighten significantly, it could result in reduced net investment income and, in turn, reduced profitability associated with new purchases of fixed maturity securities.
tightening credit spreads would reduce the discount rates used in the principles-based statutory reserve calculation, potentially increasing statutory reserve requirements and, in turn, reducing statutory surplus. although these effects on bond fund valuation and reserve discount rates run in offsetting directions for either credit spread widening or narrowing, it is possible for one of them to outweigh the other under certain market conditions. any of these risks could cause an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
reserves and exposures the amount and timing of insurance and reinsurance liability claims are difficult to predict and such claims may exceed the related liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses or future policy benefits, or the liabilities associated with certain guaranteed benefits and indexed features accounted for as embedded derivatives at fair value.
we regularly review the adequacy of the established liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and future policy benefits, as well as liabilities associated with certain guaranteed benefits and indexed features accounted for as embedded derivatives at fair value. we also conduct extensive analyses of our reserves and embedded derivatives during the year. our liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, future policy benefits and embedded derivatives, however, has and may develop adversely and materially impact our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
for general insurance, estimation of ultimate net losses, loss expenses and the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a complex process, particularly for both long-tail and medium-tail liability lines of business. there is also greater uncertainty in establishing reserves with respect to new business, particularly new business involving recently introduced product lines. in these cases, there is less historical experience or knowledge and less data upon which the actuaries can rely. estimating reserves is further complicated by unexpected claims or unintended coverages that emerge due to unexpected events, such as pandemics or geopolitical conflicts. these emerging issues may increase the size or number of claims beyond our underwriting intent and may not become apparent for many years after a policy is issued.
while we use a number of analytical reserve development techniques to project future loss development, the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses has been and may continue to be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors that were relied upon in setting the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. these changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors could be due to changes in actual versus expected claims and losses, difficulties in predicting changes, such as changes in inflation, unemployment, or other social or economic factors affecting claims, including judicial and legislative actions, and changes in the tort environment. any deviation in loss cost trends or in loss development factors might not be identified for an extended period of time after we record the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year or number of years.
for life and retirement, establishment and ongoing calculations of reserves for future policy benefits and related reinsurance assets as well as embedded derivatives and mrbs is a complex process with significant judgmental inputs, assumptions and modeling techniques, in each case yielding corresponding results which may be inaccurate or incorrect. we make assumptions regarding mortality, morbidity, discount rates, persistency and policyholder behavior at various points, including at the time of issuance and in subsequent reporting periods. an increase in the valuation of the liability could result to the extent emerging and actual experience deviates from these assumptions. the inputs and assumptions used in connection with calculations of reserves for future policy benefits are inherently uncertain. experience may develop adversely such that additional reserves must be established or the value of mrbs or embedded derivatives may increase. adverse experience could arise out of a number of factors, including, but not limited to, a severe short-term event, such as a pandemic or changes to policyholder behavior during stressed economic periods, or due to mis-estimation of long-term assumptions such as mortality, interest rates, credit spreads, equity market levels and volatility and persistency assumptions. certain variables, such as policyholder behavior, are difficult to estimate and can have a significant impact on future policy benefits, mrbs and embedded derivatives. we review and update actuarial assumptions at least annually, typically in the third quarter for reserves, mrbs and embedded derivatives. additionally, we regularly carry out cash flow testing for statutory reporting. if actual experience or revised future expectations result in projected future losses, we may be required to record additional liabilities through a charge to policyholder benefit expense, net realized gains or losses, or changes in market risk benefits in the then-current period, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

reinsurance may be unavailable or too expensive relative to its benefit, and may not be adequate to protect us against losses.
our subsidiaries are major purchasers of third-party reinsurance and we use reinsurance as part of our overall risk management strategy. while reinsurance does not discharge our subsidiaries from their obligation to pay claims for losses insured under our policies, it does make the reinsurer liable to the subsidiaries for the reinsured portion of the risk. market conditions beyond our control have impacted and may in the future impact the availability and cost of reinsurance and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. for example, reinsurance is typically more difficult or costly to obtain after a year or consecutive years with a large number of major catastrophes, the likelihood of which may be exacerbated by climate change. we have been and may, at certain times be, (i) forced to incur additional costs for reinsurance, (ii) unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms, or (iii) unable to obtain reinsurance for certain parts of our business. in instances where reinsurance is more costly, insufficient on acceptable terms or unavailable, we have had to, and will in the future have to accept an increase in exposure to risk, reduce or stop writing certain lines of business written by our subsidiaries or seek alternatives in line with our risk limits, or a combination thereof.
additionally, we are exposed to credit risk with respect to our subsidiaries' reinsurers to the extent the reinsurance receivable is not secured, or is inadequately secured by collateral or does not benefit from other credit enhancements. we also bear the risk that a reinsurer is, or may be, unwilling to pay amounts we have recorded as reinsurance recoverables for any reason, including that (i) the terms of the reinsurance contract do not reflect the intent of the parties to the contract or there is a disagreement between the parties as to their intent, or (ii) the terms of the contract cannot be legally enforced. in addition, we bear the risk that (i) the terms of the contract are interpreted by a court or arbitration panel differently than expected, (ii) the reinsurance transaction performs differently than we anticipated compared to the original structure, terms or conditions, or (iii) a change in laws and regulations, or in the interpretation of the laws and regulations, materially impacts a reinsurance transaction. the insolvency of one or more of our reinsurers, the inability or unwillingness of such reinsurers to make timely payments under the terms of our contracts or payments in an amount equal to our reinsurance recoverable, or the risk that the reinsurance transaction does not operate as intended, including due to a change in laws and regulations or on account of court or arbitration panel interpretations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity.
moreover, the use of reinsurance placed in the capital markets may not provide the same levels of protection as traditional reinsurance transactions. any disruption, volatility and uncertainty in these markets, such as following a major catastrophic event, may limit our ability to access such markets on terms favorable to us or at all. also, to the extent that we intend to use structures based on an industry loss index or other non-indemnity trigger rather than on actual losses incurred by us, we could be subject to residual risk.
our life and retirement companies also utilize intercompany reinsurance arrangements to provide capital benefits to their affiliated cedants. they have also pursued, and may continue to pursue, reinsurance transactions with external parties and permitted practices to manage the capital impact of statutory reserve requirements under applicable reserving rules, including principle-based reserving (pbr). the application of actuarial guidelines and pbr involves numerous interpretations. if state insurance departments do not agree with our interpretations or if regulations change with respect to our ability to manage the capital impact of certain statutory reserve requirements, the statutory reserve requirements of our life and retirement companies could increase, or the ability of our life and retirement companies to take reserve credit for reinsurance transactions could be reduced or eliminated. additionally, if the ratings of our life and retirement companies decline, we could incur higher costs to obtain reinsurance, each of which could adversely affect sales of our products and our financial condition or results of operations.
the availability of private sector reinsurance for terrorism is limited and we currently have limited reinsurance coverage for terrorist attacks. while we benefit from the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act (tripra), which provides u.s. government risk assistance to the insurance industry to manage the exposure to terrorism incidents, tripra has specific program limits and does not cover losses in certain lines of business such as personal property and personal casualty. we also rely on the government sponsored and government arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-u.s. jurisdictions. the realization of these risks may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
for additional information on our reinsurance recoverable, see part ii, item 7. md&a - enterprise risk management - insurance risks - reinsurance activities - reinsurance recoverable.
our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and ratings are subject to the effects of natural and man-made catastrophic events as well as mass torts.
events such as hurricanes, windstorms, hailstorms, flooding, earthquakes, landslides, wildfires, solar storms, earth sinking, tsunamis, war or other military action, acts of terrorism, explosions and fires, cyberattacks, product defects, pandemics and other highly contagious diseases, mass torts, civil unrest and other catastrophes have adversely affected our business in the past and could do so in the future.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 1a | risk factors catastrophic events, and any relevant regulations, have in the past and could in the future result in losses in any business in which we operate, and could expose us to:
•widespread claim costs associated with property, casualty, general liability, bodily injury, workers' compensation, accident and health, travel, business interruption, cyber and mortality and morbidity claims, among others;
•loss resulting from a decline in the value of our invested assets;
•limitations on our ability to recover deferred tax assets;
•loss resulting from actual policy experience that is adverse compared to the assumptions made in product pricing;
•revenue loss due to decline in customer base;
•declines in value and/or losses with respect to companies and other entities whose securities we hold and counterparties we transact business with and have credit exposure to, including reinsurers; and
•significant disruptions to our physical infrastructure, systems and operations.
natural and man-made catastrophic events are generally unpredictable. our exposure to catastrophe-related loss depends on various factors, including the frequency and severity of the catastrophes, the availability of reinsurance, the rate of inflation and the value and geographic or other concentrations of insured companies and individuals. vendor models and proprietary assumptions and processes that we use to manage catastrophe exposure may prove to be ineffective due to incorrect assumptions or estimates. for example, modeling for terrorism, cyber events and pandemics is more difficult and may be less reliable.
in addition, legislative and regulatory initiatives and court decisions following major catastrophes (both natural and man-made), as well as mass torts, have required and could in the future require us to pay the insured beyond the provisions of the original insurance policy and may prohibit the application of a deductible, resulting in inflated and unanticipated claims; or impose other restrictions, which would reduce our ability to mitigate exposure. these initiatives could impair our cash flows and, without regulatory relief, could reduce our subsidiaries' capital ratios.
for additional information on potential catastrophic events, including a sensitivity analysis of our exposure to certain catastrophes, see part ii, item 7. md&a - enterprise risk management - insurance risks.
for information regarding the effects of climate change on our business, see reserves and exposures - "climate change may adversely affect our business and financial condition" below.
for information regarding the effects of the covid-19 pandemic on our business, see business and operations - "an epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. covid-19 (including variants) has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our global business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity." below.
climate change may adversely affect our business and financial condition.
climate change, indicated by higher concentrations of greenhouse gases, a warming atmosphere and ocean, wildfires, diminished snow and ice, and a rise in sea levels, appears to have contributed to an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters and the creation of uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. as such, climate change presents significant financial implications for aig in areas such as underwriting, claims and investments, as well as risk capacity, financial reserving and operations.
climate change presents challenges to our ability to effectively underwrite, model and price catastrophe risk particularly if the frequency and severity of catastrophic events such as pandemics, hurricanes, tornadoes, heatwaves, floods, wildfires and windstorms and other natural disasters continue to increase. for example, losses resulting from actual policy experience may be adverse as compared to the assumptions made in product pricing as well as mortality assumptions and our ability to mitigate our exposure may be reduced.
climate change-related risks may also adversely impact the value of the securities that we hold or lead to credit risk of other counterparties we transact business with, including reinsurers. our reputation or corporate brand could also be negatively impacted as a result of changing customer or societal perceptions of organizations that we either insure or invest in due to their actions (or lack thereof) with respect to climate change, as well as political initiatives or other stakeholder expectations with respect thereto. any policies adopted by investors to address changing societal perceptions on climate change could result in increased compliance costs to our businesses and changes to our corporate governance and risk management practices, and may affect the type of assets we hold in our investment portfolio.
in addition, lawmakers and regulators have imposed and may continue to impose new requirements or issue new guidance aimed at addressing or mitigating climate change-related risks and efforts undertaken in response thereto. additional actions by foreign governments, regulators and international standard setters have and could result in substantial expansions of the regulations, guidance or expectations to which we may be subject. it is also possible that the laws, regulations and guidance adopted in u.s. state, u.s. federal or foreign jurisdictions regarding climate change-related risks will differ from one another, and that they could be inconsistent with the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions in which we operate.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 1a | risk factors additionally, litigation related to climate change has increased in recent years. many lawsuits center on enforcement or interpretation of environmental laws and regulations, often seeking to use litigation as a tool to influence governmental and corporate climate policies. other cases seek damages for contribution to climate change or for insufficient disclosure around material financial risks. increased litigation of this nature could trigger losses under liability policies, such as casualty and directors' and officers' insurance policies, increase our liabilities and affect the viability of certain of our business lines.
in addition, severe weather and other effects of climate change result in more frequent and more severe damages, leading to lawsuits. indirect climate change effects are also seen in litigation over flooding, mudslides and other severe weather that results in injury or damage, as well as in construction defect litigation, chemical release lawsuits, and workers' compensation claims. litigation related to climate change may, through increased claims from our customers and adverse impacts to the value of the securities that we hold, adversely impact our business and results of operations.
we have also faced and may continue to face business continuity risk as a result of climate change-related incidents that may disrupt business operations, including extreme weather events. we cannot predict the long-term impacts of climate change on our business and results of operations.
for information regarding risks associated with other catastrophic events, see reserves and exposures - "our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and ratings are subject to the effects of natural and man-made catastrophic events" above.
concentration of our insurance, reinsurance and other risk exposures may have adverse effects.
we are exposed to risks as a result of concentrations in our insurance and reinsurance policies, investments, derivatives and other obligations that we undertake for customers and counterparties. further, any risk management arrangements we employ to manage concentration risks, whether directly or through third parties, may not be available on acceptable terms or may prove to be ineffective. our risk exposures under insurance and reinsurance policies, derivatives and other obligations are, from time to time, compounded by risk exposure assumed in our investment business. also, our exposure for certain single risk coverages and other coverages may be so large that adverse experience compared to our expectations may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or result in additional statutory capital requirements for our subsidiaries.
in addition, the separation of our life and retirement business, if completed, could increase the materiality of these potential concentrations in the remaining portfolio. for additional information on risks associated with the separation of the life and retirement business from aig, see business operations - "no assurances can be given that the separation of our life and retirement business will be completed or as to the specific terms or timing thereof. in addition, we may not achieve the expected benefits of the separation and will have continuing equity market exposure to corebridge until we fully divest our stake" below.

fortitude re may fail to perform its obligations and the accounting treatment of our reinsurance agreements with fortitude re leads to volatility in our results of operations.
as of december 31, 2023, approximately $27.6 billion of reserves from aig's life and retirement run-off lines and approximately $3.0 billion of reserves from aig's general insurance run-off lines, related to business written by multiple aig subsidiaries, had been ceded to fortitude re under reinsurance transactions. these reserve balances are fully collateralized pursuant to the terms of the reinsurance transactions. our subsidiaries continue to remain primarily liable to policyholders under the business reinsured with fortitude re. as a result, if fortitude re is unable to successfully operate, or other issues arise that affect its financial condition or ability to satisfy or perform its obligations to our subsidiaries, we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity to the extent the amount of collateral posted in respect of our reinsurance receivable is inadequate. further, as is customary in similar reinsurance agreements, upon the occurrence of certain termination and recapture triggers, our subsidiaries may elect or may be required to recapture the business ceded under such reinsurance agreements, which would result in a substantial increase to our net insurance liabilities and statutory capital requirements and may require us to raise capital to recapture such ceded business. these termination and recapture triggers include fortitude re becoming insolvent or being placed into liquidation, rehabilitation, conservatorship, supervision, receivership, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, certain regulatory ratios falling below certain thresholds, and, in the case of those reinsurance agreements made with life and retirement, fortitude re's failure to perform under the reinsurance agreements, or its entry into certain transactions without receiving the consent of corebridge.
as the reinsurance transactions between aig and fortitude re are structured as modified coinsurance (modco) for the life and retirement run-off lines and loss portfolio transfer arrangements with funds withheld for the general insurance run-off lines, the manner in which we account for these reinsurance arrangements has led, and will continue to lead, to volatility in our results of operations. in modco and funds withheld arrangements, the investments supporting the reinsurance agreements, and which reflect the majority of the consideration that is paid to the reinsurer for entering into the transaction, are withheld by, and therefore continue to reside on the balance sheet of, the ceding company (i.e., aig and its subsidiaries) thereby creating a potential obligation for the aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 1a | risk factors ceding company to pay the reinsurer (i.e., fortitude re) at a later date. additionally, as our applicable insurance subsidiaries maintain ownership of these investments, aig will maintain its existing accounting for these assets (e.g., the changes in fair value of available for sale securities will be recognized within other comprehensive income). aig has established a funds withheld payable to fortitude re while simultaneously establishing a reinsurance asset representing reserves for the insurance coverage that fortitude re has assumed. the funds withheld payable contains an embedded derivative and changes in fair value of the embedded derivative related to the funds withheld payable are recognized in earnings through realized gains (losses). this embedded derivative is considered a total return swap with contractual returns that are attributable to various assets and liabilities associated with these reinsurance agreements. as a result of changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative, we experience volatility in our gaap net income.
for additional information on our exposure to credit risk of reinsurers, see reserves and exposures - "reinsurance may be unavailable or too expensive relative to its benefit, and may not be adequate to protect us against losses" above.
losses due to nonperformance or defaults by counterparties may materially and adversely affect the value of our investments, our profitability and sources of liquidity.
we are exposed to credit risk arising from exposures to various counterparties related to investments, derivatives, premiums receivable, certain general insurance businesses and reinsurance recoverables. these counterparties include, but are not limited to, issuers of fixed income and equity securities we hold, borrowers of loans we hold, customers, plan sponsors, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivatives instruments, reinsurers, corporate and governmental entities whose payments or performance we insure, joint venture partners, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses, custodians, brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, intra-group counterparties with respect to derivatives and other third parties, financial intermediaries and institutions and guarantors. these counterparties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, financial distress, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud, government intervention and other reasons. in addition, for exchange-traded derivatives, such as futures, options as well as "cleared" over-the-counter derivatives, we are generally exposed to the credit risk of the relevant central counterparty clearing house and futures commission merchants through which we clear derivatives. defaults by these counterparties on their obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments, business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
an insolvency of, or the appointment of a receiver to rehabilitate or liquidate, a significant competitor could negatively impact our business if such appointment were to impact consumer confidence in our products and services. additionally, if the underlying assets supporting the structured securities we invest in are expected to default or actually default on their payment obligations, our securities may incur losses.
in addition, our exposure to credit risk may be exacerbated in periods of market or credit stress, as derivative counterparties take a more conservative view of their acceptable credit exposure to us, resulting in reduced capacity to execute derivative-based hedges.
investment portfolio and concentration of investments our investment portfolio is concentrated in certain segments of the economy, and the performance and value of our investment portfolio are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.
our results of operations and financial condition have in the past been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by the degree of concentration in our consolidated investment portfolio. for example, we have significant holdings of real estate and real estate-related investments, including residential mortgage- backed, commercial mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities and residential and commercial (including office) mortgage loans. we also have significant exposures to financial institutions and, in particular, to money center banks and global banks, certain industries, such as energy and utilities, the u.s. federal, state and local government issuers and authorities, and global financial institutions, governments and corporations. events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular industry, asset class, group of related industries or geographic region may adversely affect the valuation of our investments to the extent they are concentrated in such segments. our ability to sell assets in such segments may be limited.
our investments are also subject to market risks and uncertainties, including, in addition to interest rate risk, changes in the level of credit spreads, currency rates, and commodity and equity prices, each of which has affected and will continue to affect the value of investments in our investment portfolio as well as the performance of, and returns generated by, such investments. for information regarding risks associated with interest rate volatility, see market conditions above.
furthermore, our alternative investment portfolio, which is subject to volatility in equity markets, includes investments for which changes in fair value are reported through pre-tax income. an economic downturn or decline in the capital markets has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our investment income, including as a result of decreases in the fair value of alternative investments.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 1a | risk factors we rely on investment management and advisory arrangements with third-party investment managers for the majority of our investment portfolio. the historical performance of blackstone, blackrock or any other investment manager we engage should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our investment portfolio, our future results or any returns expected on aig common stock.
in 2021, aig entered into a long-term investment management relationship with blackstone, pursuant to which blackstone is initially managing $50 billion of corebridge's existing investment portfolio, with that amount increasing to an aggregate of $92.5 billion by the third quarter of 2027. in addition, beginning in april 2022, certain aig and corebridge insurance company subsidiaries entered into investment management agreements with blackrock and as of december 31, 2023, blackrock manages $135 billion of our investment portfolio, consisting of liquid fixed income and certain private placement assets, including $76 billion of corebridge assets. in addition, liquid fixed income assets associated with the fortitude re funds withheld asset portfolio were separately transferred to blackrock for management.
as part of the arrangements with blackstone, blackstone is serving as exclusive external investment manager for certain of corebridge's current and future insurance company subsidiaries for certain asset classes, which has led to an increase in investment management fees payable by us as compared to expenses we have historically incurred for similar services. under the arrangements with blackstone, there are provisions that require minimum management fees to be paid to blackstone to the extent actual amounts charged to the corebridge insurance company subsidiaries are below such minimums. also, the exclusivity provisions and termination provisions that are part of these arrangements with blackstone may prevent certain of our corebridge subsidiaries from retaining other external investment managers with respect to the subject asset classes who may produce better returns on investments than blackstone. in addition, pursuant to the relevant agreements with blackstone, if such agreements are terminated for reasons other than certain specified reasons, corebridge could be required to continue paying investment advisory fees to blackstone regardless of the termination. corebridge may not have the funds available to pay any such fees and its insurance company subsidiaries may not be able or permitted to pay dividends or make other distributions to corebridge in an amount sufficient to pay any such fees or at all. any requirement to pay such fees could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
in addition, blackstone and blackrock are generally compensated based solely on our assets which they manage, rather than by investment return targets, and as a result, blackstone and blackrock are not directly incentivized to maximize investment returns. our investment portfolio's returns have benefited historically from investment opportunities and general market conditions that may not currently exist and may not be repeated. there can be no guarantee that blackstone, blackrock or any other investment manager we engage will be able to achieve any particular returns or generate investment opportunities with attractive, risk-adjusted returns for our investment portfolio in the future. if blackstone or blackrock is unable to effectively manage our portfolio, due to the concentration of assets in our portfolio that are managed by blackstone and blackrock, such inability could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
additionally, from time to time, we consider and engage in discussions with external asset managers about managing other assets in our investment portfolio that are currently managed by us. if we increase the amount of assets in our investment portfolio managed by external asset managers, it may lead to an increase in investment advisory fees payable by us. in addition, we may become more reliant on our external asset managers, and such increased dependence may reduce our internal capabilities and expertise or expose us to greater risk, including the risk that external asset managers may fail to meet our performance expectations or otherwise experience disruptions or losses.
our valuation of investments and derivatives involves the application of methodologies and assumptions to derive estimates, which may differ from actual experience and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity or lead to volatility in our net income.
it has been and may continue to be difficult to value certain of our investments or derivatives that are not actively traded. there also may be cases where certain assets in normally active markets with significant observable data become inactive with insufficient observable data due to the financial environment or market conditions in effect at that time. as a result, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation and judgment as well as valuation methods that are more complex. these values may not be realized in a market transaction, may not reflect the value of the asset and may change very rapidly as market conditions change and valuation assumptions are modified. decreases in value and/or an inability to realize that value in a market transaction or other disposition may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
for information regarding volatility in accounting as it relates to fortitude re, see reserves and exposures - "fortitude re may fail to perform its obligations and the accounting treatment of our reinsurance agreements with fortitude re leads to volatility in our results of operations" above.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 1a | risk factors liquidity, capital and credit aig parent's ability to access funds from our subsidiaries is limited, and our sources of liquidity may be insufficient to meet our needs, including providing capital that may be required by our subsidiaries.
as a holding company, aig parent depends on dividends and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund operations, pay dividends, repurchase shares, meet debt service obligations and meet the capital and liquidity needs of our subsidiaries. the majority of our investments are held by our regulated subsidiaries. any inability by our subsidiaries to make dividend or other payments in an amount sufficient to enable aig parent to meet its cash requirements could have an adverse effect on our operations or our business, results of operations, financial condition, capital and liquidity.
the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to aig parent in the future will depend on their earnings, capital levels, tax considerations, covenants contained in any financing or other agreements, applicable regulatory restrictions and rating agency requirements. in addition, such payments could be limited as a result of claims against our subsidiaries by their creditors, including suppliers, vendors, lessors and employees. additionally, our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in their ability to make dividend payments to aig parent in the future because of the need to meet their obligations or to support their own capital levels or because of regulatory limits and restrictions or changes in, or interpretations of, regulatory or rating agency standards.
our decision to pursue strategic changes or transactions in our business and operations may also subject our subsidiaries' dividend plans to heightened regulatory scrutiny and could make obtaining regulatory approvals for extraordinary distributions by our subsidiaries, if required, more difficult. we are also subject to certain other restrictions on our capital from time to time.
if our liquidity is insufficient to meet our needs, we may need to have recourse to third-party financing, external capital markets or other sources of liquidity, which may not be available or could be expensive. the availability and cost of any additional financing at any given time depends on a variety of factors, including general market conditions, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit, regulatory actions and our credit ratings and credit capacity. it is also possible that, as a result of such recourse to external financing, customers, lenders or investors could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects. if aig parent is unable to satisfy a capital need of a subsidiary, the credit rating agencies could downgrade the subsidiary's financial strength ratings or the subsidiary could become insolvent or, in certain cases, could be seized by its regulator.
in the ordinary course of our business, we are required to post collateral for our insurance company subsidiaries from time to time. if our reinsurance liabilities increase, we may be required to post additional collateral for insurance company clients that we reinsure. in addition, we may be required to post additional collateral due to regulatory changes from time to time, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
for additional information on our liquidity, see part ii, item 7. md&a - liquidity and capital resources.
for additional information on rating agency requirements, see liquidity, capital and credit - "a downgrade by one or more of the rating agencies in the insurer financial strength ratings of our insurance companies could limit their ability to write or prevent them from writing new business and impair their retention of customers and in-force business, and a downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity" below.
we may not be able to generate cash to meet our needs due to the illiquidity of some of our investments.
we have a diversified investment portfolio. however, economic conditions as well as adverse capital market conditions, including a lack of buyers, the inability of potential buyers to obtain financing on reasonable terms, volatility, credit spread changes, interest rate changes, foreign currency exchange rates and/or declines in collateral values have in the past impacted, and may in the future impact, the liquidity and value of our investments.
we have investments in certain securities, including certain fixed income structured and privately placed securities as well as investments in private equity funds and hedge funds, mortgage loans, finance receivables and real estate, that are less liquid than other types of securities. collectively, investments in these assets had a carrying value of $68 billion at december 31, 2023. if it became necessary to sell such assets in a stressed market environment, the prices achieved in any sale of such securities may be lower than their carrying value, which could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. adverse changes in the valuation of real estate and real estate-linked assets, volatility or deterioration of capital markets and widening credit spreads have in the past, and may in the future, materially adversely affect the liquidity and the value of our investment portfolios, including our residential and commercial mortgage related securities portfolios.
in the event additional liquidity is required by one or more of our companies, it may be difficult for us to generate additional liquidity by selling, pledging or otherwise monetizing these or other of our investments at reasonable prices and time frames.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 1a | risk factors a downgrade by one or more of the rating agencies in the insurer financial strength ratings of our insurance companies could limit their ability to write or prevent them from writing new business and impair their retention of customers and in-force business, and a downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
downgrades of the insurer financial strength (ifs) ratings of our insurance companies could (i) prevent these companies from selling, or make it more difficult for them to succeed in selling, products and services, (ii) make it more difficult for them to obtain new reinsurance or obtain it on reasonable pricing terms, and/or (iii) result in increased policy cancellations, lapses and surrenders, termination of, or increased collateral posting obligations under, assumed reinsurance contracts, or return of premiums.
a downgrade in aig parent's credit ratings could result in a downgrade of the ifs ratings of our insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries. similarly, under credit rating agency policies, a downgrade of the ifs ratings of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries could also result in a downgrade in aig parent's credit ratings.
in addition, a downgrade of our long-term debt ratings could increase our financing costs and limit the availability of financing. a downgrade would also require us to post additional collateral payments related to derivative transactions to which we are a party, and could cause counterparties to limit or reduce their exposure to us and thus reduce our ability to manage our market risk exposures effectively.
these events could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
for additional information on rating agency actions, see part ii, item 7. md&a - liquidity and capital resources - credit ratings and - financial strength ratings.
business and operations no assurances can be given that the separation of our life and retirement business will be completed or as to the specific terms or timing thereof. in addition, we may not achieve the expected benefits of the separation and will have continuing equity market exposure to corebridge until we fully divest our stake.
since september of 2022 when aig closed on the initial public offering corebridge's common stock, we have been selling down our ownership interest. as of december 31, 2023, aig holds 52.2 percent of corebridge common stock. while we currently intend to sell down our remaining ownership interest in corebridge over time, there can be no guarantee as to the timing or pricing thereof.
the separation of our life and retirement business involves a number of risks, including (i) unanticipated developments that may delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect our ability to continue the separation, including an economic downturn or unfavorable capital markets conditions; (ii) significant costs and disruption or distraction of management from aig's other business operations, whether or not a separation is completed; (iii) rating agency actions; (iv) unforeseen losses, liabilities or asset impairments arising from the disposition; (v) challenges associated with disentangling certain operations; and (vi) if we are successful in separating the business, increased concentration of our business operations.
in addition, the separation of our life and retirement business, or a significant delay in our ability to continue to separate the business, has caused and could continue to cause the emergence or exacerbate the effects of many of the other risks noted herein, including: (i) the risk of indemnity claims or breach of contract claims that could be made against us in connection with divested businesses; (ii) changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities; (iii) our ability to utilize certain tax loss and credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income; (iv) competition for employees and managing retention of key employees; (v) maintaining relationships with certain key distributors; (vi) concentration of our insurance and other risk exposures; and (vii) increased exposure to certain risks related to deriving revenue from non-u.s. sources.
we believe that the separation of our life and retirement business allows us and corebridge to pursue distinct strategies appropriate to our respective markets. however, there can be no assurance that we will realize any or all of the expected strategic, financial, operational or other benefits of the separation. our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted if we are unable to realize the anticipated expense reductions and organizational improvements of the separation and any related restructuring activities, or if implementing these initiatives harms our relationships with customers or employees or our competitive position. additionally, we continue to have a significant equity ownership position in corebridge, and changes in the market price of corebridge common stock may have a material impact on us.
pricing for our products is subject to our ability to adequately assess risks and estimate related losses.
our business is dependent on our ability to price our products effectively and charge appropriate premiums, policy fees and other charges. pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors and assumptions, including proper evaluation of insurance risks, our expense levels, expected net investment income to be realized, our response to rate actions taken by competitors, legal and regulatory developments, the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes and inflation. management establishes target returns for each product based upon the factors described above, certain underwriting assumptions and capital requirements, including statutory, gaap and economic capital models. we monitor and manage pricing and sales to achieve target returns on new aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 1a | risk factors business, but we may not be able to achieve those returns due to the factors discussed above. additionally, the property and casualty insurance markets are historically cyclical and experience periods of relatively strong premium rates followed by periods of increased competition that push premium rates down. inadequate pricing and the difference between estimated results of the above factors compared to actual results could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our operations and our financial condition.
guarantees within certain of our life and retirement products may increase the volatility of our results.
certain of our annuity and life insurance products include features that guarantee a certain level of benefits, including guaranteed minimum death benefits, guaranteed living benefits, including guaranteed minimum income benefits, and products with guaranteed interest crediting rates, including crediting rate guarantees tied to the performance of various market indices. many of these features are accounted for at fair value as either mrbs or embedded derivatives under gaap, and they have significant exposure to capital markets and insurance risks. an increase in valuation of liabilities associated with the guaranteed features results in a decrease in our profitability and depending on the magnitude of any such increase, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, including our capitalization, as well as our financial strength ratings.
we employ a capital markets hedging strategy to partially offset the economic impacts of movements in equity, interest rate and credit markets, however, our hedging strategy may not effectively offset movements in our gaap equity or our statutory surplus and capital requirements and may otherwise be insufficient in relation to our obligations. furthermore, we are subject to the risk that changes in policyholder behavior or actual levels of mortality/longevity as compared to assumptions in pricing and reserving, combined with adverse market events, could produce losses not addressed by the risk management techniques employed. these factors, individually or collectively, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity including our ability to receive dividends from our operating companies.
changes in interest rates result in changes to the fair value liability. all else being equal, higher interest rates generally decrease the fair value of our liabilities, which increases our earnings, while low interest rates generally increase the fair value of our liabilities, which decreases our earnings. a prolonged low interest rate environment or a prolonged period of widening credit spreads may also subject us to increased hedging costs or an increase in the amount of statutory reserves that our insurance subsidiaries are required to hold for our liabilities, lowering their statutory surplus, which would adversely affect their ability to pay dividends. in addition, it may also increase the perceived value of our benefits to our policyholders, which in turn may lead to a higher than expected benefit utilization and lower than expected surrender rates of those products over time as compared to pricing assumptions.
differences between the change in fair value of the gaap mrbs and embedded derivatives, as well as associated statutory and tax liabilities, and the value of the related hedging portfolio may occur and can be caused by movements in the level of equity, interest rate and credit markets, market volatility, policyholder behavior and mortality/longevity rates that differ from our assumptions and our inability to purchase hedging instruments at prices consistent with the desired risk and return trade-off. in addition, we may sometimes choose not to hedge or fully mitigate these risks, based on economic considerations and other factors. the occurrence of one or more of these events has in the past resulted in, and could in the future result in, an increase in the fair value of liabilities associated with the guaranteed benefits without an offsetting increase in the value of our hedges, or a decline in the value of our hedges without an offsetting decline in our liabilities, thus reducing our results of operations and shareholders' equity.
for additional information on these products, see item 1. business - regulation, part ii, item 7. md&a - critical accounting estimates - market risk benefits and notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
our risk management policies, standards and procedures may prove to be ineffective and leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
we have developed and continue to enhance enterprise-wide risk management policies, standards and procedures to identify, monitor and mitigate risk to which we are exposed. our risk management policies, standards and procedures may not be sufficiently comprehensive and may not identify or adequately protect us from every risk to which we are exposed. many of our methods of identifying, measuring, underwriting and managing risks are based upon our study and use of historical market, applicant, customer, employee and bad actor behavior or statistics based on historical models. as a result, these methods may not accurately predict future exposures from events such as a major financial market disruption as the result of a natural or man-made disaster (for example, a severe climate-related event or terrorist attack), that could be significantly different than the historical measures indicate, and which could also result in a substantial change in policyholder behavior and claims levels not previously observed. we have and will continue to enhance our underwriting processes, including, from time to time, considering and integrating newly available sources of data to confirm and refine our traditional underwriting methods. our efforts at implementing these improvements may not, however, be fully successful, which may adversely affect our competitive position. we have also introduced new product features designed to limit our risk and taken actions on in-force business, which may not be fully successful in limiting or eliminating risk. we may take additional actions on our in-force business, including adjusting crediting rates and cost of insurance, which may not be fully successful in maintaining profitability and which may result in litigation. moreover, our hedging programs and reinsurance strategies that are designed to manage market risk and mortality risk rely on assumptions regarding our assets, liabilities, general market factors and the creditworthiness of our counterparties that could prove to be incorrect or inadequate. our hedging programs utilize various derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts, interest rate swaps and swaptions, as well as other hedging aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 1a | risk factors instruments, which may not effectively or completely reduce our risk; and assumptions underlying models used to measure accumulations and support reinsurance purchases may prove inaccurate and could leave us exposed to larger than expected catastrophe losses in a given year. in addition, our current business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be sufficient to reduce the impact of pandemics, a major cyber attack, including ransomware, and other natural or man-made catastrophic events that are beyond our anticipated thresholds or impact tolerances. other risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, clients, or other matters that is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us, which may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. management of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record and verify large numbers of transactions and events in each jurisdiction in which we operate. jurisdictions have unique requirements with respect to artificial intelligence and environmental, social and governance matters, which may impact the efficacy of our standardized risk management tools and techniques and therefore our policies and procedures may not be fully effective. accordingly, our risk management policies and procedures may not adequately mitigate the risks to our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
if our risk management policies and procedures are ineffective, we may suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected. as our businesses change and the markets in which we operate evolve and new risks emerge, including risks posed by the rapidly developing technology associated with artificial intelligence and the implementation thereof within our operations, by our third-party vendors and by competitors and unanticipated challenges with respect thereto. as a result, there is a risk that new products or new business strategies may present risks that are not appropriately identified, monitored or managed. the effectiveness of our risk management strategies may be limited, resulting in losses, because of market stress, unanticipated financial market movements or unanticipated claims experience from adverse mortality, morbidity or policyholder behavior. in addition, there can be no assurance that we can effectively review and monitor all risks or that all of our employees will understand and follow (or comply with) our risk management policies and procedures.
our foreign operations expose us to risks that may affect our operations.
aig provides insurance solutions that help businesses and individuals in approximately 190 countries and jurisdictions protect their assets and manage risks through aig operations and network partners. a substantial portion of our business is conducted outside the united states, and we intend to continue to grow our business in strategic markets. operations outside the united states have in the past been, and may in the future be, affected by elevated climate risks, regional economic downturns, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, political events or upheaval, sanctions policies, nationalization and other restrictive government or regulatory actions, which could also affect our other operations.
aig subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions must satisfy local regulatory requirements and it is possible that these local licenses may require aig parent to meet certain conditions. licenses issued by foreign authorities to our subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation. consequently, our insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future business in some of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. adverse actions from any single country could adversely affect our results of operations, depending on the magnitude of the event and our financial exposure at that time in that country.
aig is subject to myriad regulations which govern items such as sanctions, bribery and anti-money laundering, for which failure to comply could expose us to significant penalties. the usa patriot act of 2011 requires companies to know certain information about their clients and to monitor their transactions for suspicious activities. the foreign corrupt practices act makes it unlawful for certain classes of persons and entities to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business. also, the department of the treasury's office of foreign assets control administers regulations that restrict or prohibit dealings involving certain organizations, individuals and countries. the uk, the eu, japan and other jurisdictions maintain similar laws and regulations. although we have policies and controls in place that are designed to ensure compliance with these laws, if those controls are ineffective and/or an employee or third party fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties, including disgorgement, and our business and our reputation could be adversely affected.
we are exposed to certain risks if we are unable to maintain the availability of our critical technology systems and data and safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of our data, which could compromise our ability to conduct business and adversely affect our consolidated business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
we use information technology systems, infrastructure and networks and other operational systems to store, retrieve, evaluate and use customer, employee and company data and information. our business is highly dependent on our ability to access these systems and networks to perform necessary business functions. in the event of a natural disaster, unauthorized access, a terrorist attack, a major cyber attack or other disruption, our systems, networks, and data may be inaccessible to our employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time, and we may be unable to meet our business obligations and regulatory requirements for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled, manipulated, destroyed or otherwise compromised. additionally, some of our technology systems are older, legacy-type systems that are less efficient and require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain or upgrade. some of these systems cannot be fully protected because of the inability to implement the latest security patches. supply chain disruptions or delays could prevent us from maintaining and implementing changes, updates and upgrades to our systems and networks in a timely manner or at all. system and network failures or outages could compromise our aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 1a | risk factors ability to perform business functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business, hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers and expose us to legal claims as well as regulatory investigations and sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
some of these technology systems also rely upon third-party systems and services, which themselves may rely on the systems and services of other third parties. problems caused by, or occurring in relation to, our third-party providers' systems and services, including those resulting from breakdowns or other disruptions in information technology services provided by our third-party providers and the other third-parties on which they rely, our inability to acquire third-party services on commercially acceptable terms, failure of a third-party provider to perform as anticipated or in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, inability of a third-party provider to provide the required volumes of services or our third-party providers experiencing cyberattacks or data breaches, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
like other global companies, the systems and networks we maintain and third-party systems and networks we use have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to or targets of unauthorized or fraudulent access, including physical or electronic break-ins or unauthorized tampering, as well as attempted cybersecurity threats such as "denial of service" attacks, phishing, automated attacks, and other disruptive attacks, including ransomware. cyber threats are constantly evolving and the techniques used in these attacks change, develop and evolve rapidly, including the use of emerging technologies, such as broader forms of artificial intelligence and quantum computing by nation state threat actors and criminal organizations. the new cyber risks introduced by these changes in technology require us to devote significant attention to identification, assessment and analysis of the risks and implementation of corresponding preventative measures. additionally, the frequency and sophistication of such threats continue to increase and often become further heightened in connection with geopolitical tensions. also, like other global companies, we have an increasing challenge of retaining and attracting highly qualified personnel to assist us in combatting these security threats.
there is no assurance that our cybersecurity measures, including information security and technology policies and standards, administrative, technical and physical controls and other actions by us or contracted third-parties designed as preventative, will provide fully effective protection from threats to our data, systems and networks, including malware and computer virus attacks, ransomware, unauthorized access, business e-mail compromise, misuse, denial-of-service attacks, system failures and other disruptions. aig maintains insurance to cover operational risks, such as cyber risk and technology outages, but this insurance may not cover all costs associated with the consequences of information systems or personal, confidential or proprietary information being compromised. in the case of a successful ransomware attack in which our data and information systems are compromised and applicable restore control processes to restore access are not effective, our information could be held hostage until a ransom, which may be significant, is paid. in some cases, such a compromise may not be immediately detected which may make it difficult to restore critical services, mitigate damage to assets and maintain the integrity and security of data including our policyholder, employee, agent, and other confidential information processed through our systems and networks.
additionally, since we rely heavily on information technology and systems (which increasingly will include the use of artificial intelligence) and on the integrity and timeliness of data to run our businesses and service our customers, any such security event and resulting compromise of systems or data may impede or interrupt our business operations and our ability to service our customers, and otherwise may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
there can be no assurance that any actions taken by us to evaluate and enhance our information security and technology systems and processes, including third-party systems and services on which we rely, as well as changes designed to update and enhance our protective measures to address new threats, will decrease the risk of a system or process failure or may create a gap in the associated security measures during the change period. any such system or process failure or security measures gap could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
we routinely transmit, receive and store personal, confidential and proprietary information by secured email and other electronic means. although we attempt to keep such information confidential and secure, we may be unable to do so in all events, especially with clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties who may not have or use appropriate controls to protect personal, confidential or proprietary information. failure to secure or appropriately handle personal, confidential or proprietary information could cause a loss of data or compromised data integrity, give rise to remediation or other expenses, expose us to liability under u.s. and international laws and regulations, and subject us to litigation, investigations, sanctions, and regulatory and law enforcement action, and result in reputational harm and loss of business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
furthermore, certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with laws and regulations enacted by u.s. federal and state governments, the eu or other jurisdictions or enacted by various regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to the privacy and security of the information of clients, employees or others. the variety of applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations exposes us to heightened regulatory scrutiny, requires us to incur significant technical, legal and other expenses in an effort to ensure and maintain compliance and will continue to impact our business in the future by increasing legal, operational and compliance costs. while we have taken steps to comply with privacy and information security laws, we cannot guarantee that our efforts will meet the evolving standards imposed by data protection authorities. if we are found not to be in compliance with these aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 1a | risk factors privacy and security laws and regulations, we may be subject to additional potential private consumer, business partner or securities litigation, regulatory inquiries, and governmental investigations and proceedings, including class-actions. any such developments may damage our reputation and subject us to material fines and other monetary penalties and damages, divert management's time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. additionally, we expect that developments in privacy and cybersecurity worldwide will increase the financial and reputational implications following a significant breach of our or our third-party suppliers' information technology systems. for additional information on data protection and cybersecurity regulations, see item 1. business - regulation - privacy, data protection, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence requirements, and part ii, item 7. md&a - enterprise risk management - operational risk management - cybersecurity risk.
third parties we rely upon to provide certain business and administrative services on our behalf may not perform as anticipated, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
we have used and will continue to use outsourcing strategies and third-party providers to transform operational and back office processes and deliver contracted services in a broad range of areas. such areas include, but are not limited to, administration or servicing of certain policies and contracts, finance, actuarial, information technology services related to infrastructure, and investment advisory and management services for certain funds, plans and retail advisory programs we offer, as well as our own investments. in addition, we have engaged with blackrock for use of its investment management and risk analytics technology platform, aladdin. the implementation of aladdin is comprised of multiple workstreams that are complex and require significant time and resource prioritization. while we have achieved key milestones in the implementation of the technology, there could be delays due to lack of sufficient resources to execute on a timely basis, inefficiencies stemming from changes that may be required to the program or sequencing, failure to meet operational and financial targets due to additional priorities or other factors. these risks may impair our ability to achieve anticipated improvements in our businesses may disrupt or may otherwise harm our operations which could materially and adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and operations.
further, we have engaged blackstone and blackrock to serve as our investment managers for the majority of aig's investment assets. for information regarding our reliance on blackstone and blackrock as a third-party investment managers, see investment portfolio and concentration of investments - "we rely on investment management and advisory arrangements with third-party investment managers for the majority of our investment portfolio. the historical performance of blackstone, blackrock or any other asset manager we engage should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our investment portfolio, our future results or any returns expected on aig common stock" above.
some of the third-party providers we use are located outside the u.s., which exposes us to business disruptions and political risks inherent to conducting business outside of the u.s. we periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us, such third parties or regulators. if such third-party providers experience disruptions, fail to meet applicable licensure requirements, do not perform as anticipated or in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, terminate or fail to renew our relationships, or such third-party providers in turn rely on services from another third-party provider, who experiences such disruptions, licensure failures, nonperformance or noncompliance, termination or non- renewal of its contractual relationships, we may experience operational difficulties, an inability to meet obligations (including, but not limited to, contractual, legal, regulatory or policyholder obligations), a loss of business, increased costs or reputational harm, compromises to our data integrity, or suffer other negative consequences, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. third parties performing regulated activities on our behalf, such as sales and servicing of insurance products, pose a heightened risk as we may be held accountable for third-party conduct that is not in compliance with applicable law.
for information regarding cyber risk arising from third-party providers, see business and operations - "we are exposed to certain risks if we are unable to maintain the availability of our critical technology systems and data and safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of our data, which could compromise our ability to conduct business and adversely affect our consolidated business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity" above.
we may experience difficulty in marketing and distributing products through our current and future distribution channels and the use of third parties may result in additional liabilities.
we maintain relationships with a number of key distributors, which results in certain distributor concentration. distributors have in the past, and may in the future, elect to renegotiate the terms of existing relationships, such that those terms may not remain attractive or acceptable to us, limit the products they sell, including the types of products offered by us, or otherwise reduce or terminate their distribution relationships with us, with or without cause. this could be due to various reasons, such as industry consolidation of distributors or other industry changes that increase the competition for access to distributors, developments in laws or regulations that affect our business or industry, including the marketing and sale of our products and services, adverse developments in our business, the distribution of products with features that do not meet minimum thresholds set by the distributor, strategic decisions that impact our business, adverse rating agency actions or concerns about market-related risks.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 1a | risk factors alternatively, renegotiated terms may not be attractive or acceptable to distributors, or we may terminate one or more distribution agreements due to, for example, a loss of confidence in, or a change in control of, one of the third-party distributors. an interruption or reduction in certain key relationships could materially affect our ability to market our products and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
key distribution partners could merge, consolidate, change their business models in ways that affect how our products are sold, or terminate their distribution contracts with us, or new distribution channels could emerge and adversely impact the effectiveness of our distribution efforts. an increase in bank, wirehouse and broker-dealer consolidation activity could increase competition for access to distributors, result in greater distribution expenses and impair our ability to market certain of our products through these channels.
also, if we are unsuccessful in attracting, retaining and training key distribution partners, or are unable to maintain our distribution relationships, our sales could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. in addition, substantially all of our distributors are permitted to sell our competitors' products. if our competitors offer products that are more attractive than ours or pay higher commission rates to the distribution partners than we do or for other reasons outside of our control, these distribution partners could concentrate their efforts in selling our competitors' products instead of ours.
in addition, we can, in certain circumstances, be held responsible for the actions of our third-party distributors, including broker- dealers, registered representatives, insurance agents and agencies, marketing organizations, and their respective employees, agents and representatives, in connection with the marketing and sale of our products by such parties, including the security of their operations and their handling of confidential information and personal data, in a manner that is deemed not compliant with applicable laws and regulations. this is particularly acute with respect to unaffiliated distributors where we may not be able to directly monitor or control the manner in which our products are sold through third-party firms despite our risk assessment, training and compliance programs. further, misconduct by employees, agents and representatives of our broker-dealer subsidiaries in the sale of our products could also result in violations of laws by us or our subsidiaries, regulatory sanctions and serious reputational or financial harm to us. the precautions we take to prevent and detect the foregoing activities may not be effective. if our products are distributed to customers for whom they are unsuitable or distributed in a manner alleged to be inappropriate, or third-party distributors experience a security or data breach due to deficient operational controls, we could suffer reputational and/or other financial harm to our business.
for information regarding suitability standards, see item 1. business - regulation - regulatory regimes - united states.
our restructuring initiatives may not yield our expected reductions in expenses and improvements in operational and organizational efficiency.
we may not be able to fully realize the anticipated expense reductions and operational and organizational efficiency improvements we expect to result from our focus on our operating model and associated initiatives. actual costs to implement these initiatives may exceed our estimates or we may be unable to fully implement and execute these initiatives as planned. our businesses and results of operations may be negatively impacted if we are unable to realize these anticipated expense reductions and efficiency improvements or if implementing these initiatives harms our relationships with customers or employees or our competitive position. the successful implementation of these initiatives may continue to require us to effect business rationalizations, technology enhancements, business process outsourcing, workforce reductions, modifications to our operating model and other actions, which depend on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control.
business or asset acquisitions and dispositions may expose us to certain risks.
the completion of any business or asset acquisition or disposition is subject to certain risks, including those relating to the receipt of required regulatory approvals, the terms and conditions of regulatory approvals including any financial accommodations required by regulators, our ability to satisfy such terms, conditions and accommodations, the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of a transaction and the risk that parties may not be willing or able to satisfy the conditions to a transaction. as a result, there can be no assurance that any business or asset acquisition or disposition will be completed as contemplated, or at all, or regarding the expected timing of the completion of the acquisition or disposition. for example, there can be no certainty as to the sale of our remaining stake in corebridge nor the timing, pricing or terms thereof.
once we complete acquisitions or dispositions, there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated economic, strategic or other benefits of any transaction. for example, the integration of businesses we acquire may not be as successful as we anticipate or there may be undisclosed risks present in such businesses. acquisitions and dispositions involve a number of risks, including operational, strategic, financial, accounting, legal, compliance and tax risks. difficulties integrating an acquired business may result in the acquired business performing differently than we expected (including through the loss of customers) or in our failure to realize anticipated expense- related efficiencies. our existing businesses could also be negatively impacted by acquisitions. risks resulting from future acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. in connection with a business or asset disposition, we may also hold a concentrated position in securities of the acquirer as part of the consideration, which subjects us to risks related to the price of equity securities and our ability to monetize such securities. we have also provided and may provide financial guarantees and indemnities in connection with the businesses we have sold or may sell, as described in aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 1a | risk factors greater detail in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. additionally, difficulties or delays in separating a divested business from our existing infrastructure, systems and operations could reduce the anticipated economic, strategic or other benefits of such transaction. while we do not currently believe that claims under these indemnities will be material, it is possible that significant indemnity claims could be made against us. if such a claim or claims were successful, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
for additional information regarding the risks associated with aig's separation of its life and retirement business, see business and operations - "no assurances can be given that the separation of our life and retirement business will be completed or as to the specific terms or timing thereof. in addition, we may not achieve the expected benefits of the separation and will have continuing equity market exposure to corebridge until we fully divest our stake" above.
significant legal or regulatory proceedings may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
in the normal course of business, we face significant risk from regulatory and governmental investigations and civil actions, litigation and other forms of dispute resolution in various domestic and foreign jurisdictions. in our insurance and reinsurance operations, we frequently engage in litigation and arbitration concerning the scope of coverage under insurance and reinsurance contracts, and face litigation and arbitration in which our subsidiaries defend or indemnify their insureds under insurance and reinsurance contracts.
additionally, from time to time, various regulatory and governmental agencies review the transactions and practices of aig and our subsidiaries in connection with company-specific matters, or industry-wide and other inquiries into, among other matters, the business practices of current and former operating insurance subsidiaries. such reviews, investigations, inquiries or examinations have and could lead to extended delays to, or prohibitions of, such transactions or practices, or develop into administrative, civil or criminal proceedings or enforcement actions, in which remedies could include fines, penalties, restitution or alterations to our business practices, and could result in additional expenses, limitations on certain business activities and reputational damage.
aig, our subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors are also subject to, or may become subject to, a variety of additional types of legal disputes brought by holders of aig securities, customers, employees and others, alleging, among other things, breach of contractual or fiduciary duties, bad faith, indemnification and violations of federal and state statutes and regulations. certain of these matters may also involve potentially significant risk of loss due to the possibility of significant jury awards and settlements, punitive damages or other penalties. many of these matters are also highly complex and seek recovery on behalf of a class or similarly large number of plaintiffs. it is therefore inherently difficult to predict the size or scope of potential future losses arising from them, and developments in these matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations.
for information regarding certain legal proceedings, see notes 17 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.
increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from investors, customers, regulators, policymakers and other stakeholders regarding environmental, social and governance matters, including governmental responses to such matters, may adversely affect our reputation or otherwise adversely impact our business and results of operations.
there is increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from investors, customers, regulators, policymakers and other stakeholders on companies' governance, risk oversight, disclosures, plans, policies and practices regarding environmental, social and governance matters, including those related to environmental stewardship, climate change, diversity, equity and inclusion, racial justice and workplace conduct. these standards and expectations may also, as a whole, reflect diverging or conflicting values or policy objectives.
governmental actions to mitigate climate and other risks related to environmental, social and governance matters could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. internationally and at the u.s. federal and state levels, regulators have imposed and likely will continue to impose requirements and guidance related to environmental, social and governance matters, which may conflict with one another, impose additional costs on us and expose us to new or additional risks, including financial, regulatory, litigation, reputational and operational risks. see business - regulation - climate change.
certain organizations that provide information to investors have developed ratings for evaluating companies on their approach to different environmental, social and governance matters, and unfavorable ratings of our company or our industries may lead to negative investor sentiment and the diversion of investment to other companies or industries. we may not be able to meet environmental, social, governance or sustainability targets, goals, plans, standards or expectations (including any previously announced climate target, goal or plan), whether established or set by us or third parties, due to a variety of factors, including regulatory or other developments, changes to the methodologies, assumptions and estimates that underlie our climate- and other sustainability-related targets, goals and strategy, or the actions of or information provided by third parties outside of our control, who may apply standards, methodologies, practices and policies that differ from ours. if we are unable to meet such targets, goals, plans, standards or expectations, it could result in adverse publicity, reputational harm, or loss of customer and/ or investor confidence, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 1a | risk factors for information on the effects of climate change on our business, see reserves and exposures - "climate change may adversely affect our business and financial condition" above.
an epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. covid-19 (including variants) has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our global business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
public health crises have previously resulted in significant societal disruption, economic uncertainty, volatility in business and consumer confidence and global economic slowdowns. the covid-19 pandemic, in particular, and related governmental response measures introduced by various national and local governmental authorities (such as restrictions on social activity, travel, movement and certain economic activity) caused significant societal disruption, volatility in the capital markets, disruptions in the labor market, supply chain disruption, significant impacts on commercial real estate due to the increase in remote working arrangements, mortality increases as compared to pricing expectations and most recently, an inflationary environment, which have had adverse economic impacts on our business in various ways.
for example, we have experienced increased claim volumes; adverse effects resulting from our exposure to certain industries, such as brick-and-mortar retail and commercial office space resulting from remote work, and difficulties in arriving at accurate valuations thereof, which has caused or may cause impairment of the estimates and assumptions used to run our businesses or resulting in greater variability and subjectivity in our investment decisions; and increased difficulty and cost in obtaining reinsurance coverage.
in addition, covid-19 adversely affected our premiums and deposits in some of our insurance lines, including our life and retirement products. further, our policies with premium adjustment features tied to exposure levels, as is the case in certain specialty and casualty lines, have in certain cases been be triggered, resulting in premium reductions. it is also possible that class actions and other proceedings may in the future be filed against us, our insureds, or others, seeking coverage for covid 19-related losses or alleging bad-faith denials of coverage for such losses.
if these effects are prolonged, or if new covid-19 variants emerge, a periodic spike in covid-19 occurs or an unrelated epidemic emerges which requires reimplementation of the response measures outlined above, the markets and economies in which we operate may experience heightened stress and further volatility, which may exacerbate the impacts of covid-19 set out above and may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, remote or hybrid work may negatively impact our culture and employees' morale, which could result in greater turnover, lower productivity and greater operational risks.
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims.
effective intellectual property rights protection, including in the form of contractual rights, copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, may be unavailable, limited, or subject to change in some countries where we do or plan to do business. third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. we have, and may in the future, litigate to protect our intellectual property. any such litigation may be costly and may not be successful. additionally, third parties may have patents or other protections that could be infringed by our products, methods, processes or services or which could limit our ability to offer certain product features. consequently, we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights. any such intellectual property litigation could prove to be both costly and unsuccessful result in significant expense, damages, and in some circumstances we could be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers. alternatively, we could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties to resolve infringement or contractual disputes. the loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce the protection of our intellectual property assets could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete.
regulation our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in laws and regulations may affect our operations, increase our insurance subsidiary capital requirements or reduce our profitability.
our operations generally, and our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries in particular, are subject to extensive and potentially conflicting laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. our business and financial condition are also subject to supervision and regulation by authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we do business. federal, state and foreign regulators also periodically review and investigate our insurance and reinsurance businesses, including aig-specific and industry-wide practices. the primary purpose of insurance regulation is the protection of our insurance and reinsurance contract holders. the extent of regulation on our insurance and reinsurance business varies across the jurisdictions in which we operate, but generally is governed by laws that delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to insurance departments and similar regulatory agencies. the laws and regulations that apply to our business and operations generally grant regulatory agencies and/or self-regulatory organizations broad rulemaking and enforcement powers, including the power to regulate the issuance, sale and distribution of our products, the manner in which we underwrite our policies, the delivery of our services, the nature or extent of disclosures that we give aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 1a | risk factors our customers, the compensation of our distribution partners, the manner in which we handle claims on our policies and the administration of our policies and contracts, as well as the power to limit or restrict our business for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. our life and retirement companies and their distributors are also subject to laws and regulations governing the standard of care applicable to sales of our products, the provision of advice to our customers and the manner in which certain conflicts of interest arising from or related to such sales or giving of advice are to be addressed. in addition, federal and state securities laws and regulations apply to certain of our insurance products that are considered 'securities' under such laws, including our variable annuity contracts, variable life insurance policies and the separate accounts that issue them, as well as our broker-dealer, investment advisor and mutual fund operations.
we strive to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our businesses, operations and legal entities, including maintenance of all required licenses and approvals. the application of and compliance with such laws and regulations may be subject to interpretation, evolving industry practices and regulatory expectations that could result in increased compliance costs. the relevant authorities may not agree with our interpretation of these laws and regulations, including, for example, our implementation of new or revised requirements related to the classification of debt securities that do not qualify as bonds, or with our policies and procedures adopted to address evolving industry practices or meet regulatory expectations. such authorities' interpretations and views may also change from time to time. it is also possible that the laws, regulations and interpretations across various jurisdictions in which we do business may conflict with one another and affect how we do business in the united states and globally. if we are found not to have complied with applicable legal or regulatory requirements, these authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities, impose substantial administrative penalties such as fines or require corrective actions, which individually or in the aggregate could interrupt our operations and materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. additionally, when such authorities' interpretation of new or revised requirements related to capital, accounting treatment and/or valuation manual or reserving (such as pbr) materially differs from ours, we have incurred or may incur higher operating costs, or sales of products subject to such requirements or treatment may be affected.
regulators in jurisdictions in which we do business have adopted rbc, solvency and liquidity standards applicable to insurers and reinsurers operating in their jurisdiction. failure to comply with such capital (including, in the u.s., rbc), solvency, liquidity and similar requirements, or as otherwise may be agreed by us or one of our insurance company subsidiaries with an insurance regulator, would generally permit the insurance regulator to take certain regulatory actions that could materially impact the affected company's operations. those actions range from requiring an insurer to submit a plan describing how it would regain a specified rbc or solvency ratio to a mandatory regulatory takeover of the company. the naic adopted in 2020, and the iais is developing and testing for implementation beginning in 2025, methodologies for assessing group-wide regulatory capital, which might evolve into more formal group-wide prescribed capital requirements on certain insurance companies and/or their holding companies that may augment state-law rbc standards, and similar international standards, that apply at the legal entity level, and such capital calculations may be made, in whole or in part, on bases other than the statutory statements of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries. furthermore, efforts to address systemic risks within the financial services industry, including insurance services, may lead regulators to apply new or heightened standards and safeguards for activities or practices that we and other insurers or other nonbank financial services companies, including insurers, engage in. in addition to the regulation of specific activities, the financial stability oversight council has authority under dodd-frank to determine that certain nonbank financial companies be designated as nonbank sifis subject to supervision by the board of governors of the federal reserve system and enhanced prudential standards, and recently adopted revised guidance and procedures intended to govern any such designations. we cannot predict the effect that any such initiatives or heightened standards may have on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
there has also been increased regulatory scrutiny of the use of "big data" techniques, machine learning, predictive models and artificial intelligence, including in the insurance industry. certain insurance regulators are developing, or have developed, regulations or guidance applicable to insurance companies that use artificial intelligence, "big data" techniques, machine learning and predictive models in their operations. we cannot predict what, if any, regulatory actions may be taken in the future with regard to "big data," artificial intelligence, machine learning or predictive models, but any limitations or restrictions could have a material impact on our business, processes, results of operations and financial condition.
we also cannot predict the impact that laws and regulations adopted in foreign jurisdictions may have on the financial markets generally or our businesses, results of operations or cash flows. it is possible such laws and regulations, including, without limitation, solvency ii and european data protection board cross border data transfer in the eu, and standard-setting initiatives by the fsb and the iais, including, but not limited to, the iais' common framework for the supervision of iaigs, its holistic framework for the assessment and mitigation of systemic risk and the development and refinement of a risk-based global ics, may significantly alter our business practices. for example, regulators have imposed and may continue to impose new requirements or issue new guidance aimed at addressing or mitigating climate change-related risks. they may also limit our ability to engage in capital or liability management, require us to raise additional capital, and impose burdensome requirements and additional costs. it is also possible that the laws and regulations adopted in foreign jurisdictions will differ from one another, and that they could be inconsistent with the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions in which we operate, including the united states.
for additional information on our regulatory environment, see item 1. business - regulation.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 1a | risk factors for information regarding the effects of regulations related to climate change on our business, see reserves and exposures - "climate change may adversely affect our business and financial condition" above.
for information regarding the regulatory response to the covid-19 pandemic, see business and operations - "an epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. covid-19 (including variants) has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our global business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity." above.
new laws and regulations or new interpretations of current laws and regulations, both domestically and internationally, may affect our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and ability to compete effectively.
legislators, regulators and self-regulatory organizations have in the past, and may in the future, periodically consider various proposals that may affect or restrict, among other things, our business practices and activities, product designs and distribution relationships, how we market, sell or service certain products we offer, the investment assets we hold and our investment management practices, our capital, reserving and accounting requirements, or the profitability of certain of our businesses.
further, new laws and regulations may affect or significantly limit our ability to conduct certain businesses at all, including proposals relating to restrictions on the type of activities in which financial institutions are permitted to engage into. these proposals or changes in legislation or regulation could also impose additional taxes on a limited subset of financial institutions and insurance companies (either based on size, activities, geography or other criteria), limit our ability to engage in capital or liability management, require us to raise additional capital, and impose burdensome requirements and additional costs. it is uncertain whether and how these and other such proposals or changes in legislation or regulation would apply to us, those who sell or service our products, or our competitors or how they could impact our ability to compete effectively, as well as our business, consolidated results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
an "ownership change" could limit our ability to utilize tax loss and credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income.
as of december 31, 2023, on a u.s. gaap basis, aig parent had u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $22.0 billion. our ability to use these tax attributes to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an "ownership change" as defined in section 382 of the internal revenue code. in general, an ownership change will occur when the percentage of aig parent's ownership (measured by value) by one or more "5-percent shareholders" (as defined in the internal revenue code) has increased by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage owned by such shareholders at any time during the prior three years (calculated on a rolling basis). an entity that experiences an ownership change generally will be subject to an annual limitation on its utilization of pre-ownership change tax loss and credit carryforwards equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long- term, tax-exempt rate posted monthly by the irs (afr) (subject to certain adjustments). the annual limitation would be increased each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year. the limitation on our ability to utilize tax loss and credit carryforwards arising from an ownership change under section 382 of the internal revenue code would be dependent on the value of our equity and the afr at the time of any ownership change. if we were to experience an "ownership change," it is possible that a significant portion of our tax loss and credit carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them to offset future taxable income.
new and proposed changes to tax laws could increase our corporate taxes or make some of our products less attractive to consumers.
the inflation reduction act of 2022, includes a 15 percent corporate alternative minimum tax (camt) on adjusted financial statement income for corporations with average profits over $1 billion over a three-year period. although the u.s. treasury and the internal revenue service issued interim camt guidance during 2023, many details and specifics of application of the camt remain subject to future guidance. we are subject to camt for 2023. our estimated camt liability will continue to be refined based on future guidance.
new tax laws outside the u.s., in particular those enacted in response to proposals by the organisation for economic cooperation and development, could make substantive changes to the global international tax regime. such changes could increase our global tax costs. aig continues to monitor and assess the impact of such proposals.
finally, it is possible that tax laws will be further changed either in a technical corrections bill or entirely new legislation. it remains difficult to predict whether or when there will be any tax law changes or further guidance by the authorities in the u.s. or elsewhere in the world. new or proposed changes to tax laws may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as the impact of proposals on our business can vary substantially depending upon the specific changes or further guidance made and how the changes or guidance are implemented by the authorities.

aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 1a | risk factors estimates and assumptions estimates or assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements and modeled results used in various areas of our business may differ materially from actual experience.
our financial statements are prepared in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap), which requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. the accounting policies that we consider most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, and therefore may be viewed as critical accounting estimates, are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements and in item 7. md&a - critical accounting estimates. these accounting estimates require the use of assumptions, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. these estimates are based on judgment, current facts and circumstances, and, when applicable, models developed internally or with inputs from third parties. therefore, actual results may differ from these estimates and models, possibly in the near term, and could have a material effect on our financial statements.
in addition, we employ models to price products, calculate reserves and future policy benefits and value assets and execute hedging strategies, as well as to assess risk and determine statutory capital requirements, among other uses. these models are complex and rely on estimates and projections that are inherently uncertain, may use incomplete, outdated or incorrect data or assumptions and may not operate as intended. to the extent that any of our operating practices and procedures do not accurately produce, or reproduce, data that we use to conduct any or all aspects of our business, such differences may negatively impact our business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition. for our life and retirement companies, significant changes in policyholder behavior assumptions such as lapses, surrenders and withdrawal rates as well as the amount of withdrawals, fund performance, equity market returns and volatility, interest rate levels, the health habits of the insured population, technologies and treatments for disease or disability, the economic environment, or other factors could negatively impact our assumptions and estimates. to the extent that any of our modeling practices do not accurately produce, or reproduce, data that we use to conduct any or all aspects of our business, such errors may negatively impact our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.
changes in accounting principles and financial reporting requirements may impact our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap, which are periodically revised. accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the financial accounting standards board (fasb). the adoption of new or revised accounting standards has in the past, and may in the future impact, our reported consolidated results of operations, liquidity and reported financial condition and may cause investors to perceive greater volatility in our financial results, negatively impacting our level of investor interest and investment.
for information regarding the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but are not yet required to be implemented, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
if our businesses do not perform well and/or their estimated fair values decline, we may be required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill or establish an additional valuation allowance against the deferred income tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
goodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. we test goodwill at least annually for impairment and conduct interim qualitative assessments on a periodic basis. impairment testing is performed based upon estimates of the fair value of the "reporting unit" to which the goodwill relates. in 2023, for substantially all of the reporting units we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment of whether goodwill impairment may exist and, therefore, performed quantitative assessments that supported a conclusion that the fair value of all of the reporting units tested exceeded their book value. our goodwill balance was $3.5 billion at december 31, 2023. if it is determined that goodwill has been impaired, we must write down goodwill by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income (loss). these write-downs could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. for additional information on goodwill impairment, see part ii, item 7. md&a - critical accounting estimates - goodwill impairment and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
deferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. as of december 31, 2023, we had net deferred tax assets, after valuation allowance, of $14.1 billion, related to federal, foreign, and state and local jurisdictions. if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net income, which such action we have taken from time to time. such charges could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. for additional information on deferred tax assets, see part ii, item 7. md&a - critical accounting estimates - income taxes and note 23 to the consolidated financial statements.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 1a | risk factors employees and competition employee error and misconduct may be difficult to detect and prevent and may result in reputational damage and significant losses.
there have been a number of cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees in recent years and we are exposed to the risk that employee fraud or misconduct could occur. our informational technology, human resources and compliance departments work collaboratively to monitor for fraud and conduct extensive training for employees. however, employee fraud or misconduct may still occur. instances of fraud, illegal acts, errors, failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization, misuse of customer or proprietary/confidential information, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements or our internal policies may result in losses and/or reputational damage.
competition for employees in our industry is intense, and managing key employee succession is critical to our success. we may not be able to attract and retain the key employees and other highly skilled employees we need to support our businesses.
our success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain and attract key and other highly skilled employees. due to the intense competition in our industry for key employees, we may be unable to retain or hire such employees. in addition, we may experience higher than expected employee turnover and difficulty attracting new employees as a result of uncertainty from strategic actions and organizational and operational changes. losing any of our key employees also could have a material adverse effect on our operations given their skills, knowledge of our business, years of industry experience and the potential difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacements. our business and consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in retaining and attracting key employees.
in addition, we would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our chief executive officer, other members of senior management and other key employees. while we have succession plans and long-term compensation plans designed to retain our employees, our succession plans may not operate effectively and our compensation plans cannot guarantee that the services of these employees will continue to be available to us.
we face intense competition in each of our business lines, and technological changes may present new and intensified challenges to our businesses.
our businesses operate in highly competitive environments, both domestically and overseas. our principal competitors are other large multinational insurance organizations, as well as banks, investment banks and other nonbank financial institutions.
general insurance and life and retirement compete through a combination of risk acceptance criteria, product pricing, and terms and conditions. reductions of our credit ratings or ifs ratings or negative publicity may make it more difficult to compete to retain existing customers and to maintain our historical levels of business with existing customers, counterparties and distribution relationships. a decline in our position as to any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our profitability.
technological advancements and innovation in the insurance industry, including those related to evolving customer preferences, the digitization of insurance products and services, data ingestion and exchange with trading partners, acceleration of automated underwriting, and use of artificial intelligence and electronic processes present competitive risks. technological advancements and innovation are occurring in distribution, underwriting, recordkeeping, advisory, marketing, claims and operations at a rapid pace, and that pace may increase, particularly as companies increasingly use data analytics and technology as part of their business strategy. if we are unable to effectively implement these technological advancements in our business, including the use of artificial intelligence, in a way that matches or exceeds our competitors, we may suffer competitive harm as a result, which could adversely impact our reputation, results of operations and financial condition. for further discussion on regulatory developments with respect to emerging technologies, see - regulation below.
further, additional costs may also be incurred in order to implement changes to automate procedures critical to our distribution channels in order to increase flexibility of access to our services and products. while we seek opportunities to leverage technological advancements and innovation for our customers' benefit, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if external technological advancements or innovation, or the regulation of technological advancements or innovation, limit our ability to retain existing business, write new business at adequate rates or on appropriate terms, render our insurance products less suitable or impact our ability to adapt or deploy current products as quickly and effectively as our competitors.

aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | use of non-gaap measures use of non-gaap measures throughout this md&a, we present our financial condition and results of operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful and representative of our business results. some of the measurements we use are "non-gaap financial measures" under sec rules and regulations. gaap is the acronym for "generally accepted accounting principles" in the united states. the non-gaap financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarly-named measures reported by other companies.
we use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of our business segments. we believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors. when we use these measures, reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measure are provided on a consolidated basis in the consolidated results of operations section of this md&a.
book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (aoci) adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to fortitude re funds withheld assets and deferred tax assets (dta) (adjusted book value per common share) is used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-common share basis after eliminating items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period including changes in fair value (1) of aig's available for sale securities portfolio, (2) of market risk benefits attributable to our own credit risk and (3) due to discount rates used to measure traditional and limited payment long-duration insurance contracts, foreign currency translation adjustments and u.s. tax attribute deferred tax assets. this measure also eliminates the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. in addition, we adjust for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to fortitude re funds withheld assets held by aig in support of fortitude re's reinsurance obligations to aig post deconsolidation of fortitude re (fortitude re funds withheld assets) since these fair value movements are economically transferred to fortitude re. we exclude deferred tax assets representing u.s. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. as net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the dta utilized is included in these book value per common share metrics. adjusted book value per common share is derived by dividing total aig common shareholders' equity, excluding aoci adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to fortitude re funds withheld assets, and dta (adjusted common shareholders' equity), by total common shares outstanding.
return on common equity - adjusted after-tax income excluding aoci adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to fortitude re funds withheld assets and dta (adjusted return on common equity) is used to show the rate of return on common shareholders' equity. we believe this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value (1) of aig's available for sale securities portfolio, (2) of market risk benefits attributable to our own credit risk and (3) due to discount rates used to measure traditional and limited payment long-duration insurance contracts, foreign currency translation adjustments and u.s. tax attribute deferred tax assets. this measure also eliminates the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. in addition, we adjust for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to fortitude re funds withheld assets since these fair value movements are economically transferred to fortitude re. we exclude deferred tax assets representing u.s. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. as net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the dta utilized is included in adjusted return on common equity. adjusted return on common equity is derived by dividing actual or annualized adjusted after-tax income attributable to aig common shareholders by average adjusted common shareholders' equity.
adjusted after-tax income attributable to aig common shareholders is derived by excluding the tax effected adjusted pre-tax income (apti) adjustments described below, dividends on preferred stock, noncontrolling interest on net realized gains (losses), other non-operating expenses and the following tax items from net income attributable to aig:
•deferred income tax valuation allowance releases and charges;
•changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax items related to legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; and
•net tax charge related to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act.
adjusted revenues exclude net realized gains (losses), income from non-operating litigation settlements (included in other income for gaap purposes), changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits (included in net investment income for gaap purposes) and income from elimination of the international reporting lag. adjusted revenues is a gaap measure for our segments.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | use of non-gaap measures adjusted pre-tax income is derived by excluding the items set forth below from income from continuing operations before income tax. this definition is consistent across our segments. these items generally fall into one or more of the following broad categories: legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions; and measures that we believe to be common to the industry. apti is a gaap measure for our segments. excluded items include the following:
•changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits;
•net change in market risk benefits (mrbs);
•changes in benefit reserves related to net realized gains and losses;
•changes in the fair value of equity securities;
•net investment income on fortitude re funds withheld assets;
•following deconsolidation of fortitude re, net realized gains and losses on fortitude re funds withheld assets;
•loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt;
•all net realized gains and losses except earned income (periodic settlements and changes in settlement accruals) on derivative instruments used for non-qualifying (economic) hedging or for asset replication. earned income on such economic hedges is reclassified from net realized gains and losses to specific apti line items based on the economic risk being hedged (e.g. net investment income and interest credited to policyholder account balances);
•income or loss from discontinued operations;
•net loss reserve discount benefit (charge);
•pension expense related to lump sum payments to former employees;
•net gain or loss on divestitures and other;
•non-operating litigation reserves and settlements;
•restructuring and other costs related to initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses, improve efficiency and simplify our organization;
•the portion of favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development for which we have ceded the risk under retroactive reinsurance agreements and related changes in amortization of the deferred gain;
•integration and transaction costs associated with acquiring or divesting businesses;
•losses from the impairment of goodwill;
•non-recurring costs associated with the implementation of non-ordinary course legal or regulatory changes or changes to accounting principles; and
•income from elimination of the international reporting lag.
•general insurance
-ratios: we, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, use the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. these ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses (which for general insurance excludes net loss reserve discount), and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. a combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under gaap, and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes. the underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. in addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios.
-accident year loss and accident year combined ratios, as adjusted (accident year loss ratio, ex-cat and accident year combined ratio, ex-cat): both the accident year loss and accident year combined ratios, as adjusted, exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events, in each case, having a net impact on aig in excess of $10 million and man-made catastrophe losses, such as terrorism and civil disorders that exceed the $10 million threshold. we believe that as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an ongoing basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of management's control. we also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results.
•life and retirement
-premiums and deposits: includes direct and assumed amounts received and earned on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and life-contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment-type annuity contracts, federal home loan bank (fhlb) funding agreements and mutual funds. we believe the measure of premiums and deposits is useful in understanding customer demand for our products, evolving product trends and our sales performance period over period.
results from discontinued operations are excluded from all of these measures.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment.
the accounting policies that we believe are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, which are critical accounting estimates, are related to the determination of:
•loss reserves;•valuation of future policy benefit liabilities and recognition of measurement gains and losses;•valuation of mrbs related to guaranteed benefit features of variable annuity, fixed annuity and fixed index annuity products;•valuation of embedded derivative liabilities for fixed index annuity and index universal life products;•reinsurance assets, including the allowance for credit losses and disputes;•goodwill impairment;•allowance for credit losses on certain investments, primarily on loans and available for sale fixed maturity securities;•fair value measurements of certain financial assets and financial liabilities; and•income taxes, in particular the recoverability of our deferred tax asset and establishment of provisions for uncertain tax positions.
these accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. to the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected.
loss reserves loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of unpaid claims, including estimates for claims incurred but not reported and loss adjustment expenses, less applicable discount. we regularly review and update the methods used to determine loss reserve estimates. because these estimates are subject to the outcome of future events and because loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed, changes in estimates are common.
the estimate of loss reserves relies on several key judgments:
•the determination of the actuarial methods used as the basis for these estimates;
•the relative weights given to these models by product line;
•the underlying assumptions used in these models; and
•the determination of the appropriate groupings of similar product lines and, in some cases, the disaggregation of dissimilar losses within a product line.
numerous assumptions are made in determining the best estimate of reserves for each line of business, in consideration of expected ultimate losses, loss cost trends and loss development factors, where appropriate. the importance of any one assumption can vary by both line of business and accident year. because such assumptions may differ from actual experience, there is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserves. this estimation uncertainty is particularly relevant for long-tail lines of business.
all of our methods to calculate net reserves include assumptions about estimated reinsurance recoveries and their collectability. reinsurance collectability is evaluated independently of the reserving process and appropriate allowances for uncollectible reinsurance are established.
overview of loss reserving process and methods our loss reserves can generally be categorized into two distinct groups: short-tail reserves and long-tail reserves. short-tail reserves consist principally of u.s. property and special risks, europe property and special risks, u.s. personal insurance, and europe and japan personal insurance. long-tail reserves include u.s. workers' compensation, u.s. excess casualty, u.s. other casualty, u.s. financial lines, and uk/europe casualty and financial lines.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates short-tail reserves in short-tail lines of business, such as property or personal insurance, where the nature of these claims tends to be higher frequency with short reporting periods, with volatility arising from occasional severe events, the actual losses reported make up a greater proportion of the ultimate loss estimate. during the first few development quarters of an accident year, the expected ultimate losses generally reflect the average loss costs from a period of preceding accident quarters that have been adjusted for changes in rate and loss cost trends, mix of business, known exposure to unreported losses, or other factors affecting the particular line of business. for more mature quarters, specific loss development methods and/or frequency/severity methods may be used to determine the incurred but not reported (ibnr). ibnr for claims arising from catastrophic events or events of unusual severity would be determined taking into account information known by the claims department, using alternative techniques or expected percentages of ultimate loss emergence based on historical emergence of similar events or claim types.
long-tail reserves estimation of loss reserves for our long-tail business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the product line and volume of business, as well as estimates of reinsurance recoveries. experience in more recent accident years generally provides limited statistical credibility of reported net losses on long-tail business. that is because in the more recent accident years, a relatively low proportion of estimated ultimate net incurred losses are reported or paid. therefore, ibnr reserves constitute a relatively high proportion of loss reserves.
for our long-tail lines, we generally make actuarial and other assumptions with respect to the following:
•loss cost trend factors, which are used to establish expected loss ratios for subsequent accident years based on the projected loss ratios for prior accident years.
•expected loss ratios, which are used for the latest accident year and, in some cases, for accident years prior to the latest accident year. the expected loss ratio also generally reflects the average loss ratio from prior accident years, adjusted for the loss cost trend and the effect of rate changes and other quantifiable factors on the loss ratio.
•loss development factors, which are used to project the reported losses for each accident year to an ultimate basis. generally, the actual loss development factors observed from prior accident years would be used as a basis to determine the loss development factors for the subsequent accident years.
•tail factors, which are development factors used for certain long-tail lines of business to project future loss development for periods that extend beyond the available development data. the development of losses to the ultimate loss for a given accident year for these lines may take decades and the projection of ultimate losses for an accident year is very sensitive to the tail factors selected beyond a certain age.
we record quarterly changes in loss reserves for each product line of business. the overall change in our loss reserves is based on the sum of the changes for all product lines of business. the quarterly loss reserve changes are based on the estimated current loss ratio for each subset of coverage less any amounts paid. also, any change in estimated ultimate losses from prior accident years deemed to be necessary based on the results of our latest detailed valuation reviews, large loss analyses, or other analytical techniques, either positive or negative, is reflected in the loss reserve and incurred losses for the current quarter. differences between actual loss emergence in a given period and our expectations based on prior loss reserve estimates are used to monitor reserve adequacy between detailed valuation reviews and may also influence our judgment with respect to adjusting reserve estimates.
details of the loss reserving process the process of determining the current loss ratio for each product line of business is based on a variety of factors. these include considerations such as: prior accident year and policy year loss ratios; rate changes; and changes in coverage, reinsurance, or mix of business. other considerations include actual and anticipated changes in external factors such as trends in loss costs, inflation, employment rates or unemployment duration or in the legal and claims environment. the current loss ratio for each product line of business is intended to represent our best estimate after reflecting all relevant factors. at the close of each quarter, the assumptions and data underlying the loss ratios are reviewed to determine whether they remain appropriate. this process includes a review of the actual loss experience in the quarter, actual rate changes achieved, actual changes in reinsurance, quantifiable changes in coverage or mix of business, and changes in other factors that may affect the loss ratio. the loss ratio is changed to reflect the revised estimate if this review suggests that the previously determined loss ratio is no longer appropriate and, generally, shorter tailed lines of business are more likely to experience changes than longer tailed lines for immature accident years unless the information is directionally unfavorable.
we conduct a comprehensive loss reserve detailed valuation review at least annually for each product line of business in accordance with actuarial standards of practice. these standards provide that the unpaid loss estimate may be presented in a variety of ways, such as a point estimate, a range of estimates, a point estimate based on the expected value of several reasonable estimates, or a probability distribution of the unpaid loss amount. our actuarial best estimate for each product line of business represents an expected value generally considering a range of reasonably possible outcomes.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates the reserve analysis, globally, for each product line of business is performed by a credentialed actuarial team in collaboration with claims, underwriting, business unit management, risk management and senior management. our actuaries consider the ongoing applicability of prior data groupings and update numerous assumptions, including the analysis and selection of loss development and loss trend factors. they also determine and select the appropriate actuarial or other methods used to develop our best estimate for each business product line, and may employ multiple methods and assumptions for each product line. these data groupings, accident year weights, method selections and assumptions necessarily change over time as business mix changes, development factors mature and become more credible and loss characteristics evolve. we consult with third-party specialists to help inform our judgments as needed. through the execution of these detailed valuation reviews an actuarial best estimate of the loss reserve is determined. the sum of these estimates for each product line of business yields an overall actuarial best estimate for that line of business.
a critical component of our detailed valuation reviews is an internal peer review of our reserving analyses and conclusions, where actuaries independent of the initial review evaluate the reasonableness of assumptions used, methods selected, and weightings given to different methods. in addition, each detailed valuation review is subjected to a review and challenge process by specialists in our enterprise risk management (erm) group.
for certain product lines, we measure sensitivities and determine explicit ranges around the actuarial best estimate using multiple methodologies and varying assumptions. where we have ranges, we use them to inform our selection of best estimates of loss reserves by product line of business. our range of reasonable estimates is not intended to cover all possibilities or extreme values and is based on known data and facts at the time of estimation.
actuarial and other methods for our lines of business our actuaries determine the appropriate actuarial methods and segmentation. this determination is based on a variety of factors including the nature of the losses associated with the product line of business, such as the frequency or severity of the claims. in addition to determining the actuarial methods, the actuaries determine the appropriate loss reserve groupings of data. this determination is a judgmental, dynamic process and refinements to the groupings are made every year. the groupings may change to reflect observed or emerging patterns within and across product lines, or to differentiate risk characteristics (for example, size of deductibles and extent of third-party claims specialists used by our insureds). as an example of reserve segmentation, we write many unique subsets of professional liability insurance, which cover different products, industry segments, and coverage structures. while for pricing or other purposes, it may be appropriate to evaluate the profitability of each subset individually, we believe it is appropriate to combine the subsets into larger groups for reserving purposes to produce a greater degree of credibility in the loss experience. this determination of data segmentation and related actuarial methods is assessed, reviewed and updated at least annually.
the actuarial methods we use most commonly include paid and incurred loss development methods, expected loss ratio methods, including "bornhuetter ferguson" and "cape cod," and frequency/severity models. loss development methods utilize the actual loss development patterns from prior accident years updated through the current year to project the reported losses to an ultimate basis for all accident years. we also use this information to update our current accident year loss selections. loss development methods are generally most appropriate for lines of business that exhibit a stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next, and for which the components of the product line have similar development characteristics. expected loss ratio methods rely on the application of an expected loss ratio to the earned premium for the product line of business to determine the liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses. we generally use expected loss ratio methods in cases where the reported loss data lacked sufficient credibility to utilize loss development methods, such as for new product lines of business or for long-tail product lines at early stages of loss development. frequency/severity models may be used where sufficient frequency counts are available to apply such approaches.
a key advantage of loss development methods is that they respond more quickly to any actual changes in loss costs for the product line of business. therefore, if loss experience is unexpectedly deteriorating or improving, the loss development method gives full credibility to the changing experience. expected loss ratio methods would be slower to respond to the change, as they would continue to give more weight to a prior expected loss ratio, until enough evidence emerged to modify the expected loss ratio to reflect the changing loss experience. on the other hand, loss development methods have the disadvantage of overreacting to changes in reported losses if the loss experience is anomalous due to the various key factors described above and the inherent volatility in some of the lines. for example, the presence or absence of large losses at the early stages of loss development could cause the loss development method to overreact to the favorable or unfavorable experience by assuming it is a fundamental shift in the development pattern. in these instances, expected loss ratio methods such as bornhuetter ferguson have the advantage of recognizing large losses without extrapolating unusual large loss activity onto the unreported portion of the losses for the accident year.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates the cape cod method is a hybrid between the loss development and bornhuetter ferguson methods, where the historic loss data and loss development factor assumptions are used to determine the expected loss ratio estimate in the bornhuetter ferguson method.
where appropriate, supplemental analysis for the given line of business may be performed in addition to the above described techniques such as shareholder class action suit analysis for directors and officers (d&o) coverages.
frequency/severity methods generally rely on the determination of an ultimate number of claims and an average severity for each claim for each accident year. multiplying the estimated ultimate number of claims for each accident year by the expected average severity of each claim produces the estimated ultimate loss for the accident year. frequency/severity methods generally require a sufficient volume of claims in order for the average severity to be predictable. average severity for subsequent accident years is generally determined by applying an estimated annual loss cost trend to the estimated average claim severity from prior accident years. in certain cases, a structural approach may also be used to predict the ultimate loss cost. frequency/severity methods have the advantage that ultimate claim counts can generally be estimated more quickly and accurately than can ultimate losses. thus, if the average claim severity can be accurately estimated, these methods can more quickly respond to changes in loss experience than other methods. however, for average severity to be predictable, the product line of business must consist of homogenous types of claims for which loss severity trends from one year to the next are reasonably consistent and where there are limited changes to deductible levels or limits. generally these methods work best for high frequency, low severity product lines of business such as personal auto. however, frequency and severity metrics are also used to test the reasonability of results for other product lines of business and provide indications of underlying trends in the data. in addition, ultimate claim counts can be used as an alternative exposure measure to earned premiums in the cape cod method.
the estimation of liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental pollution losses on insurance policies written many years ago is typically subject to greater uncertainty than other types of losses. this is due to inconsistent court decisions, as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies or have expanded theories of liability. in addition, reinsurance recoverable balances relating to asbestos and environmental loss reserves are subject to greater uncertainty due to the underlying age of the claim, underlying legal issues surrounding the nature of the coverage, and determination of proper policy period. for these reasons, these balances tend to be subject to increased levels of disputes and legal collection activity when actually billed. the insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures.
we continue to receive claims asserting injuries and damages from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged claims to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites, referred to collectively as environmental claims, and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. the vast majority of these asbestos and environmental losses emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. commencing in 1985, standard policies contained absolute exclusions for pollution-related damage and asbestos. the current environmental policies that we specifically price and underwrite for environmental risks on a claims-made basis have been excluded from the analysis. nevertheless, most of these legacy exposures have been heavily reinsured with very highly rated reinsurers.
the majority of our remaining exposures for asbestos and environmental losses are related to excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages. the litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity amounts, with litigation expenses included within the limits of the liability we incur. individual significant loss reserves, where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on a case-by-case basis.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates key assumptions of our actuarial methods by line of business line of business or category                       key assumptions u.s. workers'compensation                          we generally use a combination of loss development and expected loss ratio methods for u.s. workers' compensation as this is a long-tail line of business. the tail factor is typically the most critical assumption, and small changes in the selected tail factor can have a material effect on our carried reserves. for example, the tail factors beyond twenty years for guaranteed cost business could vary by 1 percentage point below to 2.5 percentage points above those indicated in the 2023 detailed valuation review. for excess of deductible business, in our judgment, it is reasonably possible that tail factors beyond twenty years could vary by 1.5 percentage points below to 3 percentage points above those indicated in the 2023 detailed valuation review.
u.s. excess casualty                               we utilize various loss cost trend assumptions for different segments of the portfolio. in our judgment, after evaluating the historical loss cost trends from prior accident years since the early 1990s, it is reasonably possible that actual loss cost trends applicable to the year-end 2023 detailed valuation review for u.s. excess casualty may range 5 percentage points lower or higher than this estimated loss trend. the loss cost trend assumption is critical for the u.s. excess casualty line of business due to the long-tail nature of the losses, and it is applied across many accident years. thus, there is the potential for the loss reserves with respect to a number of accident years (the expected loss ratio years) to be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends that were initially relied upon in setting the loss reserves. these changes in loss trends could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting losses.u.s. excess casualty is a long-tail line of business and any deviation in loss development factors might not be discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. mass tort claims in particular may develop over a very extended period and impact multiple accident years, so we usually select a separate pattern for them. thus, there is the potential for the loss reserves with respect to a number of accident years to be significantly affected by changes in loss development factors that were initially relied upon in setting the reserves. in our judgment, after evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since the early 1990s, it is reasonably possible that the actual loss development factors could vary by an amount equivalent to a six month shift from those actually utilized in the year-end 2023 detailed valuation review. this would impact projections both for accident years where the selections were directly based on loss development methods as well as the a priori loss ratio assumptions for accident years with selections based on bornhuetter ferguson or cape cod methods. similar to loss cost trends, these changes in loss development factors could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting losses.given the very long-tail nature of this business, the tail factor selection can also have material impact on our carried reserves. the sensitivity around tail selection may also be a proxy for the sensitivity of a calendar year impact of monetary inflation on unpaid losses. it is reasonably possible for the tail factors for excess casualty could vary by 2 percentage points below to 3.5 percentage points above those indicated in the 2023 detailed valuation review.
u.s. other casualty                                the key assumptions for other casualty lines are similar to u.s. excess casualty, as the underlying business is long-tailed and can be subject to variability in loss cost trends and changes in loss development factors. these may differ significantly by line of business as coverages such as general liability, medical malpractice and environmental may be subject to different risk drivers.
u.s. financial lines                               the loss cost trends for u.s. d&amp;o liability business vary by year and subset. after evaluating the historical loss cost levels from prior accident years since the early 1990s, including the potential effect of losses relating to the credit crisis, in our judgment, it is reasonably possible that the actual variation in loss cost levels for these subsets could vary by approximately 10 percentage points lower or higher on a year-over-year basis than the assumptions actually utilized in the year-end 2023 reserve review. because the u.s. d&amp;o business has exhibited highly volatile loss trends from one accident year to the next, there is the possibility of an exceptionally high deviation. in our analysis, the effects of loss cost trend assumptions affect the results through the a priori loss ratio assumptions used for the bornhuetter ferguson and cape cod methods, which impact the projections for the more recent accident years.the selected loss development factors are also an important assumption, but are less critical than for u.s. excess casualty. because these lines are written on a claims made basis, the loss reporting and development tail is much shorter than for u.s. excess casualty. however, the high severity nature of the losses does create the potential for significant deviations in loss development patterns from one year to the next. similar to u.s. excess casualty, after evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably possible that actual loss development factors could change by an amount equivalent to a shift by six months from those actually utilized in the year-end 2023 reserve review.
uk/europe casualty andfinancial lines              similar to u.s. business, uk/europe casualty and financial lines can be significantly impacted by loss cost trends and changes in loss development factors. the variation in such factors can differ significantly by product and region, however the range of potential impacts is much lower than that of other lines of business noted above.
u.s. and uk/europeproperty and specialrisks        for shorter-tail lines such as property and special risks, variance in outcomes for individual large claims or events typically has a greater impact on results than does changes in actuarial assumptions or methodology. this is because a greater proportion of the ultimate loss, at any stage of development, is composed of reported losses than ibnr reserves. these outcomes generally relate to unique characteristics of events such as catastrophes or losses with significant business interruption claims.
u.s., uk/europe and                                personal insurance is short-tailed in nature similar to property and special risks but less volatile. variance in estimates can result from unique events such as catastrophes. in addition, some subsets of this business, such as auto liability, can be impacted by changes in loss development factors and loss cost trends.

updating net premiums ratios (nprs) - remeasurement gains and losses: generally, future policy benefits are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of future benefits less the present value of future net premiums (portion of the gross premium required to provide for all benefits and expenses). the assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities are initially set when a policy is issued and an npr is established. benefit liabilities are subsequently remeasured periodically to reflect changes in policy assumptions and actual versus expected experience and are recognized as remeasurement gains and losses, a component of policyholder benefits. the assumptions include mortality, morbidity and persistency. these assumptions are typically consistent with pricing inputs at policy issuance. liabilities are accreted using an upper-medium grade (low credit risk) fixed income instrument yield that is locked-in at policy issuance. the liabilities are remeasured at the balance sheet date using a current upper-medium grade yield with changes in the liabilities reported in other comprehensive income (loss) (oci).
for universal life policies with secondary guarantees: we recognize certain liabilities in addition to policyholder account balances. for universal life policies with secondary guarantees, as well as other universal life policies for which profits followed by losses are expected at contract inception, a liability is recognized based on a benefit ratio of (a) the present value of total expected payments, in excess of the account value, over the life of the contract, divided by (b) the present value of total expected assessments over the life of the contract. universal life account balances are reported in policyholder contract deposits, while these additional liabilities related to universal life products are reported within future policy benefits in the consolidated balance sheets. these additional liabilities are also adjusted to reflect the effect of unrealized gains or losses on fixed maturity securities available for sale on accumulated assessments, with related changes recognized through other comprehensive income (loss). the policyholder behavior assumptions for these liabilities include mortality, lapses and premium persistency. the capital market assumptions used for the liability for universal life secondary guarantees include discount rates and net earned rates.

gmxbs are recognized as mrbs and can be assets or liabilities, and represent the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account value, with changes in fair value of mrbs recognized in the consolidated statements of income (loss) and the portion of the fair value change attributable to our own credit risk recognized in oci.
our exposure to the guaranteed amounts is equal to the amount by which the contract holder's account balance is below the amount provided by the guaranteed feature. a deferred annuity contract may include more than one type of gmxb; for example, it may have both a gmdb and a gmwb. however, a policyholder can generally only receive payout from one guaranteed feature on a contract containing a death benefit and a living benefit, i.e., the features are generally mutually exclusive (except a surviving spouse who has a rider to potentially collect both a gmdb upon their spouse's death and a gmwb during his or her lifetime). a policyholder cannot purchase more than one living benefit on one contract. declines in the equity markets, increased volatility and a low interest rate environment generally increase our exposure to potential benefits under the guaranteed features, leading to an increase in the liabilities for those benefits.

guaranteed benefitfeature        reserving methodology &amp;key assumptions fair value methodology           guaranteed minimum benefits on annuity products are market risk benefits that are required to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value of the liabilities recorded in changes in the fair value of market risk benefits, except for changes related to the company's own credit risk which are recorded in aoci. the fair value of these benefits is based on assumptions that a market participant would use in valuing these mrbs.the company applies a non-option-based approach for variable products, and an option-based approach for fixed index and fixed products. under the non-option-based approach, a portion of actual fees (i.e., attributed fees) is determined such that the present value of expected benefits less attributed fees is zero at issue. this calculated ratio is locked in and utilized in each policy valuation going forward and results in an mrb value of zero at policy issue. under the option-based approach, the mrb value at issue represents the present value of expected benefits after account value exhaustion. there is no calculated attributed fee ratio under this approach; as such, the calculated mrb liability at inception requires an equal and offsetting adjustment to the underlying host contract. consistent with the non-option-based approach, this results in no gains or losses recognized upon policy issuance. the fair value of the market risk benefits, which are level 3 assets and liabilities, is based on a risk-neutral framework and incorporates actuarial and capital market assumptions related to projected cash flows over the expected lives of the contracts. for additional information on how we value for mrbs, see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, and for information on fair value measurement of these mrbs, including how we incorporate our own non-performance risk, see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.

(a)represents the net impact of a 20 percent increase or decrease in the s&p 500 index.
(b)represents the net impact of one percent parallel shift in the yield curve.
the sensitivities of 20 percent and one percent are included for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect the changes in net investment spreads, equity return, volatility, interest rate, mortality or lapse used by aig in its fair value analyses to value other applicable liabilities. changes different from those illustrated may occur in any period and by different products.
the change in pre-tax income due to variances in equity returns or interest rates reflects the impact to mrbs using the at-issue non-performance risk adjustment (npa) and the change in embedded derivatives related to index-linked interest credit features. the change in oci due to equity returns solely reflects the impact on mrbs due to changes in the npa, while the change in oci due to interest rates also reflects the impact to the liability for future policyholder benefits, net of reinsurance.
the analysis of mrbs and embedded derivatives is a dynamic process that considers all relevant factors and assumptions described above. we estimate each of the above factors individually, without the effect of any correlation among the key assumptions. an assessment of sensitivity associated with changes in any single assumption would not necessarily be an indicator of future results. the effects on pre-tax income in the sensitivity analysis table above do not reflect the related effects from our economic hedging program, which utilizes derivative and other financial instruments and is designed so that changes in value of those instruments move in the opposite direction of changes in the guaranteed benefit mrbs and embedded derivative liabilities.

aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates reinsurance assets in the ordinary course of business, our insurance companies may use both treaty and facultative reinsurance to minimize their net loss exposure to any single catastrophic loss event or to an accumulation of losses from a number of smaller events or to provide greater diversification of our businesses. reinsurance assets include the balances due from reinsurance and insurance companies under the terms of our reinsurance agreements for paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, ceded unearned premiums and ceded future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and benefits paid and unpaid. the estimation of reinsurance recoverables involves a significant amount of judgment. reinsurance assets include reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses that are estimated as part of our loss reserving process and, consequently, are subject to similar judgments and uncertainties as the estimation of gross loss reserves. for additional information on reinsurance, see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
goodwill impairment goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. a qualitative assessment may be performed, considering whether events or circumstances exist that lead to a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an operating segment is less than its carrying value. if management elects to perform a quantitative assessment to determine recoverability of carrying value or is compelled to do so based on the results of a qualitative assessment, the estimate of fair value involves applying one or a combination of common valuation approaches. these include discounted expected future cash flows, market-based earnings multiples and external appraisals, among other methods, all of which require management judgment and are subject to uncertainty, primarily as it relates to assumptions around business growth, earnings projections, and cost of capital.
for additional information on goodwill impairment, see part i, item 1a. risk factors - estimates and assumptions and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
allowance for credit losses on certain investments we maintain an allowance for the expected lifetime credit losses of commercial and residential mortgage loans and available for sale securities. the sufficiency of this allowance is reviewed quarterly using both quantitative and qualitative considerations, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. these considerations and the overall methodology used to estimate the allowance for credit losses are discussed in more detail in note 6 and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for available for sale securities and commercial and residential loans, respectively.
fair value measurements of certain financial assets and financial liabilities assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets are measured and classified in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three levels based on the observability of inputs available in the marketplace used to measure the fair value. we classify fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities as level 3 when they require significant unobservable inputs in their valuation. we consider unobservable inputs to be those for which market data is not available. our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an asset or liability requires judgment.
for additional information about the valuation methodologies of financial instruments measured at fair value, see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
income taxes deferred income taxes represent the tax effect of the differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. our assessment of net deferred income taxes represents management's best estimate of the tax consequences of various events and transactions, which can themselves be based on other accounting estimates, resulting in incremental uncertainty in the estimation process.
deferred tax asset recoverability the evaluation of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires us to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. the weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. as such, changes in tax laws in countries where we transact business can impact our deferred tax asset valuation allowance. we consider multiple factors to reliably estimate future taxable income so we can determine the extent of our ability to realize net operating losses, foreign tax credits, realized capital loss and other carryforwards. these factors include forecasts of future income for each of our businesses, which incorporate forecasts of future statutory income for our insurance companies, and actual and planned business and operational changes, both of which include assumptions about future macroeconomic and aig-specific conditions and events. we subject the aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates forecasts to stresses of key assumptions and evaluate the effect on tax attribute utilization. we also apply stresses to our assumptions about the effectiveness of relevant prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. in performing our assessment of recoverability, we consider tax laws governing the utilization of net operating loss, capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards in each applicable jurisdiction. these tax laws are subject to change, resulting in incremental uncertainty in our assessment of recoverability.
uncertain tax positions uncertain tax positions represent aig's liability for income taxes on tax years subject to review by the internal revenue service (irs) or other tax authorities. we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, based on technical merits, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recognized in the financial statements. a tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement. the completion of review, or the expiration of federal statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the liability for income taxes.
for a discussion of our framework for assessing the recoverability of our deferred tax asset and other tax topics, see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements.
executive summary overview this overview of the md&a highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to current or potential investors in our securities. you should read this annual report in its entirety for a more detailed description of events, trends, uncertainties, risks and critical accounting estimates affecting us.
adoption of targeted improvements to the accounting for long-duration contracts in august 2018, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued an accounting standard update with the objective of making targeted improvements to the existing recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements for long-duration contracts issued by an insurance entity.
the company adopted the targeted improvements to the accounting for long-duration contracts (the standard or ldti) on january 1, 2023, with a transition date of january 1, 2021 (as described in additional detail below).
the company adopted the standard using the modified retrospective transition method relating to liabilities for traditional and limited payment contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs associated therewith, while the company adopted the standard in relation to mrbs on a retrospective basis. based upon this transition method, as of the january 1, 2021 transition date (transition date), the impact of the adoption of the standard was a net decrease to beginning aoci of $2.2 billion and a net increase to beginning retained earnings of $933 million.
the net increase in retained earnings resulted from:
•the reclassification of the cumulative effect of non-performance adjustments related to our products in individual retirement and group retirement operating segments that are currently measured at fair value (e.g., living benefit guarantees associated with variable annuities), partially offset by:
•a reduction from the difference between the fair value and carrying value of benefits not previously measured at fair value (e.g., death benefit guarantees associated with variable annuities).
the net decrease in aoci resulted from:
•the reclassification of the cumulative effect of non-performance adjustments discussed above,
•changes to the discount rate which will most significantly impact our life insurance and institutional markets segments, partially offset by:
•the removal of deferred policy acquisition costs, unearned revenue reserves, sales inducement assets and certain future policyholder benefit balances recorded in aoci related to changes in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | executive summary regulatory, industry and economic factors russia/ukraine conflict the russia/ukraine conflict began in february 2022. the conflict has and may continue to have a significant impact on the global macroeconomic and geopolitical environments, including increased volatility in capital and commodity markets, rapid changes to regulatory conditions around the globe including the use of sanctions, operational challenges for multinational corporations, inflationary pressures and an increased risk of cybersecurity incidents.
the conflict is evolving and has the potential to adversely affect our business and results of operations from an investment, underwriting and operational perspective. while we believe we have taken appropriate actions to minimize related risk, we continue to monitor potential exposure and operational impacts, as well as any actual and potential claims activity. the ultimate impact will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including scope, severity and duration, the governmental, legislative and regulatory actions taken (including the application of sanctions), and court decisions, if any, rendered in response to those actions.
impact of changes in the interest rate environment and equity markets certain key u.s. benchmark rates continued to rise during 2023 as markets reacted to heightened inflation measures, geopolitical risk, and the board of governors of the federal reserve system implementing multiple increases to short term interest rates. the yield pick of new investments over sales, maturities and paydowns and redemptions, excluding fortitude re, averaged 195 basis points during 2023. this combined with resetting of coupon rates on floating rate securities and loans has steadily improved the overall portfolio yields. however, the key benchmark rates remain highly volatile. we actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through portfolio construction and asset-liability management, including spread management strategies for our investment-oriented products and economic hedging of interest rate risk from guarantee features in our variable and fixed index annuities, but we may not be able to fully mitigate our interest rate risk by matching exposure of our assets relative to our liabilities.
equity markets our financial results are impacted by the performance of equity markets, which impacts the performance of our alternative investment portfolio, fee income and net amount at risk. for instance, in our variable annuity separate accounts, mutual fund assets and brokerage and advisory assets, we generally earn fee income based on the account value, which fluctuates with the equity markets as a significant amount of these assets are invested in equity funds. the impact of equity market returns, both increases and decreases, is reflected in our results due to the impact on the account value and the fair values of equity-exposed securities.
in life and retirement, hedging costs could also be significantly impacted by changes in the level of equity markets as rebalancing and option costs are tied to the equity market volatility. these hedging costs are partially offset by our rider fees that are tied to the level of the chicago board options exchange volatility index. as rebalancing and option costs increase or decrease, the rider fees will increase or decrease partially offsetting the hedging costs incurred.
market and other economic factors may result in increased credit impairments, downgrades and losses across single or numerous asset classes due to lower collateral values or deteriorating cash flow and profitability by borrowers could lead to higher defaults on our investment portfolio, especially in geographic, industry or investment sectors where we have higher concentrations of exposure, such as real estate related borrowings. these factors can also cause widening of credit spreads which could reduce investment asset valuations, decrease fee income and increase statutory capital requirements, as well as reduce the availability of investments that are attractive from a risk-adjusted perspective.
alternative investments include private equity funds which are generally reported on a one-quarter lag. accordingly, changes in valuations driven by equity market conditions during the fourth quarter of 2023 may impact the private equity investments in the alternative investments portfolio in the first quarter of 2024.
annuity sales and surrenders the rising rate environment and our partnership with blackstone inc. and its investment advisory affiliates (blackstone) have provided a strong tailwind for fixed and fixed index annuity sales, however, higher interest rates have also resulted in an increase in surrenders. rising interest rates could continue to create the potential for increased sales, but could also drive higher surrenders relative to what we have already experienced. fixed annuities have surrender charge periods, generally in the three-to-seven year range. fixed index annuities have surrender charge periods, generally in the five-to-ten year range, and within our group retirement segment, certain of our fixed investment options are subject to other withdrawal restrictions, which may help mitigate increased early surrenders in a rising rate environment. in addition, older contracts that have higher minimum interest rates and continue to be attractive to contract holders have driven better than expected persistency in fixed annuities, although the reserves for such contracts have continued to decrease over time in amount and as a percentage of the total annuity portfolio. we closely monitor surrenders of fixed annuities as contracts with lower minimum interest rates come out of the surrender charge period.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | executive summary reinvestment and spread management we actively monitor fixed income markets, including the level of interest rates, credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve. we also frequently review our interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for new and in-force business. business strategies continue to evolve and we attempt to maintain profitability of the overall business in light of the interest rate environment. a rising interest rate environment results in improved yields on new investments and improves margins for our life and retirement business while also making certain products, such as fixed annuities, more attractive to potential customers. however, the rising rate environment has resulted in lower values on general and separate account assets, mutual fund assets and brokerage and advisory assets that hold investments in fixed income assets.
for additional information on our investment and asset-liability management strategies, see investments.
for investment-oriented products, including universal life insurance, and variable, fixed and fixed index annuities, in our individual retirement, group retirement, life insurance and institutional markets businesses, our spread management strategies include disciplined pricing and product design for new business, modifying or limiting the sale of products that do not achieve targeted spreads, using asset-liability management to match assets to liabilities to the extent practicable, and actively managing crediting rates to help mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. renewal crediting rate management is guided by specific contract provisions designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals and subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. we expect to continue to adjust crediting rates on in-force business, as appropriate, to be responsive to changing rate environments. as interest rates rise, we may need to raise crediting rates on in-force business for competitive and other reasons, potentially offsetting a portion of the additional investment income resulting from investing in a higher interest rate environment.
of the aggregate fixed account values of our individual retirement and group retirement annuity products, 54 percent were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate as of december 31, 2023. the percentage of fixed account values of our annuity products that are currently crediting at rates above one percent were 50 percent and 55 percent as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. in the universal life products in our life insurance business, 59 percent and 62 percent of the account values were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. these businesses continue to focus on pricing discipline and strategies to manage the minimum guaranteed interest crediting rates offered on new sales in the context of regulatory requirements and competitive positioning.
general insurance our net investment income is significantly impacted by market interest rates as well as the deployment of asset allocation strategies to manage duration, enhance yield and manage interest rate risk. as interest rates increase, so too does our ability to reinvest future cash inflows from premiums, as well as sales and maturities of existing investments, at more favorable rates. for additional information on our investment and asset-liability management strategies, see investments.
while the impact of rising interest rates on our general insurance segment increases the benefit of investment income, the current and medium-term inflationary environment may also translate into higher loss cost trends. we monitor these trends closely, particularly loss cost trend uncertainty, to ensure that not only our pricing, but also our loss reserving assumptions are proactive to, and considerate of, current and future economic conditions.
for our general insurance segment loss reserves, rising interest rates may favorably impact the statutory net loss reserve discount for workers' compensation and its associated amortization.
impact of currency volatility currency volatility remains acute. strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the euro, british pound and the japanese yen (the major currencies) impacts income for our businesses with substantial international operations. in particular, growth trends in net premiums written reported in u.s. dollars can differ significantly from those measured in original currencies. the net effect on underwriting results, however, is significantly mitigated, as both revenues and expenses are similarly affected.
these currencies may continue to fluctuate, especially as a result of central bank responses to inflation, concerns regarding future economic growth and other macroeconomic factors, and such fluctuations will affect net premiums written growth trends reported in u.s. dollars, as well as financial statement line item comparability.

net income (loss) attributable to aig common shareholders years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 comparison net income (loss) attributable to aig common shareholders decreased $6.6 billion due to the following, on a pre-tax basis:
•a decrease in net realized gains on fortitude re funds withheld embedded derivative of $9.5 billion driven by interest rate movement partially offset by lower net realized losses on fortitude re funds withheld assets of $191 million; and
•a decrease in net realized gains excluding fortitude re funds withheld assets and embedded derivative of $2.4 billion, driven by a $2.3 billion decrease in derivative and hedge activity and gains on index-linked interest credited embedded derivatives, net of related hedges.
the decrease in net income (loss) attributable to aig common shareholders was partially offset by the following, on a pre-tax basis:
•an increase in net investment income of $2.8 billion primarily driven by higher income on available for sale fixed maturity securities of $2.0 billion and an increase in the fair value of fixed maturity securities where we elected the fair value option of $1.2 billion as a result of the higher interest rate environment and an increase in interest income on mortgages and other loans of $525 million, partially offset by lower returns on our alternative investments of $670 million;
•an increase in underwriting income in general insurance of $301 million, reflecting lower catastrophe losses and premium growth with improvement in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, primarily driven by changes in business mix along with continued positive rate change, focused risk selection and improved terms and conditions partially offset by lower net favorable prior year reserve development and higher expense ratio;
•a decrease in income attributable to noncontrolling interest of $811 million primarily driven by the decrease in the noncontrolling interest on corebridge as a result of a decline in net income at corebridge compared to 2022 and lower ownership by aig of corebridge common stock;
•an increase in net (gain) loss on divestitures and other from a loss of $82 million in 2022 to a gain of $643 million in 2023, primarily due to the sale of laya healthcare limited (laya); and
•a decrease in general operating expenses.
the $3.0 billion decrease in income tax expense was primarily attributable to lower income from continuing operations.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | consolidated results of operations years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 comparison net income (loss) attributable to aig common shareholders decreased $140 million due to the following, on a pre-tax basis:
•lower net gains on divestitures and other due to loss of $82 million in 2022 compared with net gains on divestitures and other in 2021 due to the recognition of $3.0 billion gain from the sale of the affordable housing portfolio and $102 million gain from the sale of certain assets of the retail mutual funds business in 2021;
•lower net investment income of $2.8 billion primarily driven by lower returns on our alternative investments of $1.9 billion and declines in fair value of fixed maturity securities where we elected the fair value option of $810 million as a result of the higher rate environment and negative equity market performance;
•a decrease in net realized gains excluding fortitude re funds withheld assets and embedded derivative of $1.8 billion, driven by losses on sales of securities of $1.1 billion and sales of alternative investments and real estate of $795 million, unfavorable movement in the allowance for credit losses on fixed maturity securities and loans of $421 million and absence of realized gains related to affordable housing portfolio sale in 2021 of $219 million, partially offset by a $856 million increase in derivative and hedge activity and gains on index-linked interest credited embedded derivatives, net of related hedges;
•a decrease in net realized gains on fortitude re funds withheld assets of $1.5 billion driven by losses on sales of available for sale fixed maturity securities of $1.0 billion and sales of alternative investments of $194 million and $162 million decrease in derivative and hedge activity; and
•higher income attributable to noncontrolling interest of $507 million driven by the sale of 9.9 percent interest of corebridge to blackstone in december 2021 and the 12.4 percent initial public offering (ipo) of corebridge in september 2022.
the decrease in net income (loss) attributable to aig common shareholders was partially offset by the following, on a pre-tax basis:
•an increase in net realized gains on fortitude re funds withheld embedded derivative of $8.1 billion driven by interest rate movements;
•higher underwriting income in general insurance of $1.1 billion, including $86 million attributable to eliminating the international reporting lag, reflecting the continued earn-in of positive rate change, strong renewal retentions and new business production, as well as increased favorable prior year development and lower catastrophe losses. underwriting income was negatively impacted by unfavorable movements in foreign exchange. for additional information on the elimination of the international reporting lag, see note 1 to the to the consolidated financial statements; and
•lower interest expense of $180 million primarily driven by interest savings of $225 million from $9.4 billion debt repurchases, through cash tender offers and debt redemptions in 2022 as well as $92 million from $3.6 billion of debt repurchases, through cash tender offers and debt redemptions in 2021, as well as interest savings of $100 million on debt borrowing due to the sale of affordable housing in 2021. these decreases are partially offset by interest expense of $240 million on $6.5 billion corebridge senior unsecured notes, $1.5 billion draw down on the corebridge 3-year delayed draw term loan agreement (the ddtl facility) and $1.0 billion junior subordinated debt issued by corebridge in 2022.
the $584 million increase in income tax expense was primarily attributable to higher income from continuing operations.
income tax expense analysis for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the effective tax rate on income (loss) from continuing operations was (0.5) percent, 21.2 percent and 18.3 percent, respectively.

competition and challenges general insurance operates in a highly competitive industry against global, national and local insurers and reinsurers and underwriting syndicates in specific market areas and product types. insurance companies compete through a combination of risk acceptance criteria, product pricing, service levels and terms and conditions. we serve our business and individual customers on a global basis - from the largest multinational corporations to local businesses and individuals. general insurance seeks to differentiate itself in the markets where we participate by providing leading expertise and insight to clients, distribution partners and other stakeholders, delivering underwriting excellence and value-driven insurance solutions and providing high quality, tailored end-to-end support to stakeholders. in doing so, we leverage our world-class global franchise, multinational capabilities, balance sheet strength and financial flexibility.
our challenges include:
•ensuring adequate business pricing given passage of time to reporting and settlement for insurance business, particularly with respect to long-tail commercial lines exposures;
•impact of social and economic inflation on claim frequency and severity; and
•volatility in claims arising from natural and man-made catastrophes and other aggregations of risk exposure.
industry and economic factors the results of general insurance for the year ended december 31, 2023 reflect continued strong performance from our commercial lines portfolio and focused execution on our portfolio management strategies within personal insurance. across our north america and international commercial lines of business we have seen increased demand for our insurance products with continued positive rate change and improvement in terms and conditions. we continue to monitor the impact of inflation, ongoing labor force and supply chain disruptions and volatile commodity prices, among other factors, on rate adequacy and loss cost trends. similarly, we are monitoring the responsive monetary policy actions taken or anticipated to be taken by central banks, to curb inflation and the corresponding impact on market interest rates.
general insurance - north america north america commercial remains in a firm market amidst a backdrop of increasing claims severity due to elevated economic and social inflation, as well as a higher frequency and severity of natural catastrophe losses over recent years. while market discipline continues to support price increases across most lines, we are seeing capacity move back into the market in certain segments given the improved pricing levels which is putting pressure on rates. we have focused on retaining our best accounts which has led to improving retention across the portfolio. these retention rates are often coupled with an exposure limit management strategy to reduce volatility within the portfolio. we continue to proactively identify segment growth areas as market conditions warrant through effective portfolio management, while non-renewing unprofitable business.
personal insurance growth prospects are supported by the need for full life cycle products and coverage, increases in personal wealth accumulation, and awareness of insurance protection and risk management. we compete in the high net worth market, accident and health insurance, travel insurance, and warranty services.

business and financial highlights net premiums written comparison for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022
net premiums written increased by $1.1 billion primarily due to:
•growth in commercial lines ($533 million), particularly in aig re and property driven by continued positive rate change, higher renewal retentions and strong new business production, partially offset by decreases in crop as a consequence of the crs sale and financial lines; and
•growth in personal insurance ($567 million) driven by pcs resulting from changes in our reinsurance program, partially offset by decreases in travel and warranty.
net premiums written comparison for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021
net premiums written increased by $631 million primarily due to growth in commercial lines ($673 million), particularly in property, casualty and aig re, driven by continued positive rate change, higher renewal retentions and strong new business production, as well as growth in crs driven by higher commodity prices, partially offset by a decrease in financial lines due to volatility in capital markets and uncertain economic conditions.
this increase was partially offset by lower production in personal insurance ($42 million), particularly in warranty as well as underwriting actions taken in pcs to improve profitability, partially offset by an increase in travel.
underwriting income (loss) comparison for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022
underwriting income increased by $559 million primarily due to:
•improvement in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted (2.4 points) primarily driven by changes in business mix along with continued positive rate change, focused risk selection and improved terms and conditions;
•higher net favorable prior year reserve development (2.8 points or $340 million), primarily due to lower unfavorable development in financial lines, partially offset by lower favorable development in casualty; and

competition and challenges life and retirement operates in the highly competitive insurance and financial services industry in the u.s. and select international markets, competing against various financial services companies, including banks and other life insurance and mutual fund companies. competition is primarily based on product pricing and design, distribution, financial strength, customer service and ease of doing business.
our business remains competitive due to its long-standing market leading positions, innovative products, distribution relationships across multiple channels, customer-focused service and strong financial ratings.
our primary challenges include:
•managing a rising rate environment. while a rising rate environment improves yields on new investment, improves margins on our business, and increases sales in certain products such as fixed annuities, it may also result in increased competition for certain products resulting in a need to increase crediting rates, and has resulted in lower separate account asset values for investments in fixed income which has reduced fee income;
•increased competition in our primary markets, including aggressive pricing of annuities by competitors, increased competition and consolidation of employer groups in the group retirement planning market, and competitors with different profitability targets in the pension risk transfer space as well as other product lines;
•increasingly complex new and proposed regulatory requirements, which have affected industry growth and costs; and
•upgrading our technology and underwriting processes while managing general operating expenses.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | business segment operations | life and retirement industry and economic factors individual retirement increasing life expectancy and reduced expectations for traditional retirement income from defined benefit programs are leading americans to seek additional financial security as they approach retirement. the strong demand for fixed index and fixed annuities with guaranteed living benefit features has attracted increased competition in this product space. in response to the ever changing interest rate environment we have developed guaranteed living benefits for variable, fixed index and fixed annuities with margins that are less sensitive to the level of interest rates. changes in the capital markets (interest rate environment, credit spreads, equity markets, volatility) can have a significant impact on sales, surrender rates, investment returns, guaranteed income features, and net investment spreads in the annuity industry.
group retirement group retirement competes in the defined contribution market under the retirement services brand. retirement services is a leading retirement plan provider in the u.s. for k-12 schools and school districts, higher education, healthcare, government and other not-for-profit institutions. the defined contribution market is a highly efficient and competitive market that requires support for both plan sponsors and individual participants. to meet this challenge, retirement services is investing in a client- focused technology platform to support improved compliance and self-service functionality. retirement services' model pairs self-service tools with its employee financial advisors who provide individual plan participants with enrollment support and comprehensive financial planning services.
changes in the interest rates, credit spreads and equity market environment can have a significant impact on investment returns, fee income, advisory and other income, guaranteed income features, and net investment spreads, and a moderate impact on sales and surrender rates.
life insurance consumers have a significant need for life insurance, whether it is used for income replacement for their surviving family, estate planning or wealth transfer. additionally, consumers use life insurance to provide living benefits in case of chronic, critical or terminal illnesses, and to supplement retirement income.
in response to consumer needs and a changing interest rate environment, our life insurance product portfolio will continue to promote products with less long-duration interest rate risk and mitigate exposure to products that have long-duration interest rate risk through sales levels and hedging strategies.
as life insurance ownership remains at historical lows in the u.s., efforts to expand the reach and increase the affordability of life insurance are critical. the industry is investing in consumer-centric efforts to reduce traditional barriers to securing life protection by simplifying the sales and service experience. digitally enabled processes and tools provide a fast, friendly and simple path to life insurance protection.
institutional markets institutional markets serves a variety of needs for corporate clients. demand is driven by a number of factors including the macroeconomic and regulatory environment. we expect to see continued growth in the pension risk transfer market (direct and assumed reinsurance) as corporate plan sponsors look to transfer asset or liability, longevity, administrative and operational risks associated with their defined benefit plans.
changes in interest rates and credit spreads can have a significant impact on investment returns and net investment spreads, impacting organic growth opportunities.

our insurance companies generate significant revenues from investment activities. as a result, the operating segments in life and retirement are significantly impacted by variances in net investment income on the asset portfolios that support insurance liabilities and surplus.

business and financial highlights adjusted pre-tax income (loss) comparison for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022
adjusted pre-tax income increased $634 million primarily due to higher net investment income, net of interest credited ($666 million) driven by higher base portfolio income, net of interest credited ($774 million) due to improved base yields and growth in invested assets driven by higher sales, plus higher yield enhancement income ($27 million), partially offset by lower alternative investment income ($135 million).
this increase was partially offset by lower policy and advisory fee income, net of advisory fee expenses ($58 million), primarily due to lower average variable annuity separate account asset values driven by negative net flows.
adjusted pre-tax income (loss) comparison for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021
adjusted pre-tax income decreased $621 million primarily due to:
•lower net investment income, net of interest credited ($567 million) primarily driven by lower alternative investment income ($401 million), lower yield enhancement income ($285 million), partially offset by higher base portfolio income, net of interest credited ($119 million); and
•lower policy and advisory fee income, net of advisory fee expenses ($149 million), primarily due to a decrease in variable annuity separate account assets driven by negative equity market performance and sale of retail mutual funds to touchstone.
partially offset by:
•lower interest expense on debt borrowings due to sale of affordable housing ($50 million); and
•lower non-deferred commissions ($45 million) due to a decrease in variable annuity separate account assets.

table of contents item 7 | business segment operations | life and retirement business and financial highlights adjusted pre-tax income (loss) comparison for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022
adjusted pre-tax income decreased $28 million primarily due to:
•lower net investment income, net of interest credited ($41 million) primarily driven by lower alternative investment income ($73 million), partially offset by higher base portfolio income, net of interest credited ($29 million).
adjusted pre-tax income (loss) comparison for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021
adjusted pre-tax income decreased $472 million primarily due to:
•lower net investment income, net of interest credited ($393 million) primarily driven by lower alternative investment income ($224 million), lower yield enhancement income ($158 million) and higher base portfolio income, net of interest credited ($11 million); and
•lower policy and advisory fee income, net of advisory fee expenses of ($88 million) due to lower fee based assets under administration as a result of lower equity market performance.
these decreases were partially offset by lower interest expense on debt borrowings due to sale of affordable housing ($29 million).
group retirement gaap premiums, premiums and deposits, surrenders and net flows premiums and deposits are a non-gaap financial measure that includes, in addition to direct and assumed premiums, deposits received on investment-type annuity contracts, fhlb funding agreements and mutual funds under administration.
net flows for annuity products included in group retirement represent premiums and deposits less death, surrender and other withdrawal benefits. net flows for mutual funds represent deposits less withdrawals. client deposits into advisory and brokerage accounts less total client withdrawals from advisory and brokerage accounts, are not included in net flows, but do contribute to growth in assets under administration and advisory fee income.

net outflows were ($3.2 billion) higher compared to the prior year primarily due to higher surrenders and withdrawals ($3.4 billion), partially offset by higher premiums and deposits ($141 million) and lower death and payout annuity benefits ($65 million). large plan acquisitions and surrenders resulted in lower net flows of ($1.4 billion) compared to the prior year. excluding large plan acquisitions and surrenders, net outflows were concentrated in products with higher contractual guaranteed minimum crediting rates.
premiums and deposits and net flow comparison for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021
net outflows decreased ($97 million) primarily due to higher premiums and deposits ($176 million), partially offset by higher death and payout annuity benefits of ($30 million), and higher surrenders and withdrawals of ($49 million). in general, net outflows are concentrated in fixed annuity products with higher contractual guaranteed minimum crediting rates. large plan acquisitions and surrenders resulted in higher net flows of ($121 million) compared to the prior year.

adjusted pre-tax income decreased $163 million primarily due to:
•lower net investment income ($110 million), driven by lower alternative investment and yield enhancement income ($103 million) primarily due to lower equity partnership performance and reduced gains on calls, and lower base portfolio income ($7 million); and
•lower premiums and fees, net of policyholder benefits, excluding actuarial assumptions update ($73 million), primarily due to international life, partially offset by favorable domestic mortality.

•lower net investment income associated with consolidated investment entities of $708 million and the absence of $56 million mark to market gain on the 2.46 percent equity interest in fortitude group holdings, llc, partially offset by the absence of mark to market losses of $272 million on our investment in collateralized loan obligations (clo) and higher income on aig parent portfolio of $139 million due to higher yields;
•lower corporate general operating expenses of $154 million primarily driven by a reduction in employee related costs of $12 million and other operating expenses of $142 million; and
•lower interest expense of $24 million primarily driven by interest savings of $136 million from $11.0 billion debt repurchases, through cash tender offers and debt redemption and maturity in 2022 and 2023, lower interest expense of $74 million associated with consolidated investments entities as a result of deconsolidation and paydowns on debt, partially offset by interest expense of $183 million on the $6.5 billion corebridge senior unsecured notes, $1.5 billion draw down on the ddtl facility and $1.0 billion junior subordinated debt issued by corebridge in 2022.
adjusted pre-tax loss on consolidation and eliminations of $10 million in 2023 compared to $405 million in 2022, a decrease of $395 million, was primarily due to the elimination of the insurance companies' net investment income from their investment in the consolidated investment entities of $419 million.

aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | investments investments overview our investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each segment by targeting an asset allocation mix that supports estimated cash flows of our outstanding liabilities and provides diversification from an asset class, sector, issuer, and geographic perspective. the primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus. the majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of fixed maturity securities.
inflation remains elevated relative to the federal reserve target however it has decreased over the past several quarters. interest rates also remain elevated although credit spreads have narrowed for most asset classes as recession concerns began to recede and the likelihood for a soft landing increased.
our investment management agreements with blackstone inc.
in 2021, aig entered into a long-term asset management relationship with blackstone inc. and its investment advisory affiliates (blackstone), pursuant to which blackstone initially managed $50 billion of corebridge's existing investment portfolio, with that amount increasing to an aggregate of $92.5 billion by the third quarter of 2027. as of december 31, 2023, blackstone manages $55 billion in book value of assets in corebridge's investment portfolio. as these assets run-off, we expect blackstone to reinvest primarily in blackstone-originated investments across a range of asset classes, including private and structured credit, and commercial and residential real estate securitized and whole loans. we continue to manage asset allocation and portfolio-level risk management decisions with respect to any assets managed by blackstone, ensuring that we maintain a consistent level of oversight across our entire investment portfolio considering our asset-liability matching needs, risk appetite and capital positions.
our investment management agreements with blackrock, inc.
since april 2022, aig and corebridge insurance company subsidiaries have entered into separate investment management agreements with blackrock, inc. and its investment advisory affiliates (blackrock). substantially all investment management agreements contemplated for aig insurance company subsidiaries have been executed. a small number of insurance companies remain under discussion and expect to be resolved in 2024. as of december 31, 2023, blackrock manages $135 billion of our investment portfolio, consisting of liquid fixed income and certain private placement assets, including $76 billion of corebridge assets. in addition, liquid fixed income assets associated with the fortitude re funds withheld asset portfolio were separately transferred to blackrock for management in 2022.
for additional information, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
investment highlights in 2023
•blended investment yields on new investments are higher than blended rates on investments that were sold, matured or called during this period. we continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities with attractive risk-adjusted return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income.•the higher interest rate environment has contributed to higher income in the base portfolio for the twelve months ended december 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year. total net investment income increased for the twelve months ended december 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher returns in our fixed maturity securities, mortgage and other loans, short-term investments and hedge fund portfolios, partially offset by lower income in our private equity portfolio.
investment strategies investment strategies are assessed at the segment level and involve considerations that include local and general market and economic conditions, duration and cash flow management, risk appetite and volatility constraints, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, tax, regulatory and legal investment limitations, and, as applicable, environmental, social and governance considerations.
some of our key investment strategies are as follows:
•our fundamental strategy across the portfolios is to seek investments with similar duration and cash flow characteristics to the associated insurance liabilities to the extent practicable.
•we seek to purchase investments that offer enhanced yield through illiquidity premiums, such as private placements and commercial mortgage loans, which also add portfolio diversification. these assets typically afford credit protections through covenants, ability to customize structures that meet our insurance liability needs, and deeper due diligence given information access.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | investments
•given our global presence, we seek investments that provide diversification from investments available in local markets. to the extent we purchase these investments, we generally hedge any currency risk using derivatives, which could provide opportunities to earn higher risk adjusted returns compared to investments in the functional currency.
•aig parent, included in other operations, actively manages its assets and liabilities, counterparties and duration. aig parent's liquidity sources are held primarily in the form of cash and short-term investments. this strategy allows us to both diversify our sources of liquidity and reduce the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity.
•within the u.s., the life and retirement and general insurance investments are generally split between reserve backing and surplus portfolios.
-insurance reserves are backed mainly by investment grade fixed maturity securities that meet our duration, risk-return, capital, tax, liquidity, credit quality and diversification objectives. we assess asset classes based on their fundamental underlying risk factors, including credit (public and private), commercial real estate and residential real estate, regardless of whether such investments are bonds, loans, or structured products.
-surplus investments seek to enhance portfolio returns and are generally comprised of a mix of fixed maturity investment grade and below investment grade securities and various alternative asset classes, including private equity, real estate equity, and hedge funds. over the past few years, hedge fund investments have been reduced.
•outside of the u.s., fixed maturity securities held by our insurance companies consist primarily of investment-grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate.
•we also utilize derivatives to manage our asset and liability duration as well as currency exposures.
asset-liability management the investment strategy within the general insurance companies focuses on growth of surplus, maintenance of sufficient liquidity for unanticipated insurance claims, and preservation of capital. general insurance invests primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans. fixed maturity securities of the general insurance companies have an average duration of 3.9 years, with an average of 4.1 years for north america and 3.5 years for international.
while invested assets backing reserves of the general insurance companies are primarily invested in conventional liquid fixed maturity securities, we have continued to allocate to asset classes that offer higher yields through structural and illiquidity premiums, particularly in our north america operations. in addition, we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate asset-backed investments to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates and inflation. we seek to diversify the portfolio across asset classes, sectors and issuers to mitigate idiosyncratic portfolio risks.
in addition, a portion of the surplus of general insurance companies is invested in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments that seek to balance liquidity, volatility and growth of surplus. although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio.
the investment strategy of the life and retirement companies is to provide net investment income to back liabilities that result in stable distributable earnings and enhance portfolio value, subject to asset-liability management, capital, liquidity and regulatory constraints.
the life and retirement companies use asset-liability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses. the life and retirement companies maintain a diversified, high-to-medium quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans that, to the extent practicable, match the duration characteristics of the liabilities. we seek to diversify the portfolio across asset classes, sectors, and issuers to mitigate idiosyncratic portfolio risks. the investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities, and as a result, duration varies between distinct portfolios. the interest rate environment has a direct impact on the asset-liability management profile of the businesses, and changes in the interest rate environment may result in the need to lengthen or shorten the duration of the portfolio. in a rising rate environment, we may shorten the duration of the investment portfolio.
fixed maturity securities of the life and retirement companies' domestic operations have an average duration of 6.9 years.
in addition, the life and retirement companies seek to enhance surplus portfolio returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved returns in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio returns.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | investments national association of insurance commissioners (naic) designations of fixed maturity securities the securities valuation office (svo) of the naic evaluates the investments of u.s. insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called naic designations. in general, naic designations of '1' highest quality, or '2' high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade, while naic designations of '3' through '6' generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade. naic designations for non-agency residential mortgage backed securities (rmbs) and commercial mortgage backed securities (cmbs) are calculated using third party modeling results provided through the naic. these methodologies result in an improved naic designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies. the following tables summarize the ratings distribution of aig subsidiaries' fixed maturity security portfolio by naic designation, and the distribution by composite aig credit rating, which is generally based on ratings of the three major rating agencies. for fixed maturity securities where no naic designation is assigned or able to be calculated using third-party data, the naic designation category used in the first table below reflects an internal rating.
the naic designations presented below do not reflect the added granularity to the designation categories adopted by the naic in 2020, which further subdivide each category of fixed maturity securities by appending letter modifiers to the numerical designations.

aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | investments index-linked interest credited embedded derivatives, net of related hedges, reflected higher losses in the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to 2022 and higher losses in the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to 2021. fair value gains or losses in the hedging portfolio are typically not fully offset by increases or decreases in liabilities due to the non-performance or "own credit" risk adjustment used in the valuation of index-linked interest credited embedded derivatives, which are not hedged as part of our economic hedging program, and other risk margins used for valuation that cause the embedded derivatives to be less sensitive to changes in market rates than the hedge portfolio.
net realized gains (losses) on fortitude re funds withheld assets primarily reflect changes in the valuation of the modified coinsurance and funds withheld assets. increases in the valuation of these assets result in losses to aig as the appreciation on the assets under those reinsurance arrangements must be transferred to fortitude re. decreases in valuation of the assets result in gains to aig as the depreciation on the assets under those reinsurance arrangements must be transferred to fortitude re. for additional information on the impact of the funds withheld arrangements with fortitude re, see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

in the twelve months ended december 31, 2021, we recognized favorable prior year loss reserve development of $115 million. the key components of this development were:
north america
•strong favorable development in personal insurance, primarily attributable to subrogation recovery related to the 2017 and 2018 california wildfires partially offset by the impact of dropping below the attachment point of our 2018 catastrophe aggregate treaty, which also adversely impacted our u.s. property and special risk commercial lines.
•favorable development on u.s. workers' compensation and short-tailed commercial lines within other product lines, reflecting lower frequency and severity in recent calendar years.
•amortization benefit related to the deferred gain on the adverse development cover.
•reserve strengthening within u.s. financial lines, reflecting higher severity of claims in directors & officers, principally from accident years 2018 and prior, and cyber risk from accident years 2019 and 2020.
international
•favorable development on short-tailed international commercial lines and personal insurance, reflecting lower frequency and severity of claims.
•reserve strengthening on international financial lines, reflecting higher severity of claims, the majority of which is from accident years 2018 and prior.
other operations
•unfavorable development primarily attributed to the blackboard insurance portfolio due to increased severity on reported claims.
we note that for certain categories of claims (e.g., construction defect claims and environmental claims) and for reinsurance recoverable, losses may sometimes be reclassified to an earlier or later accident year as more information about the date of occurrence becomes available to us.
significant reinsurance agreements in the first quarter of 2017, we entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with nico, under which we transferred to nico 80 percent of the reserve risk on substantially all of our u.s. commercial long-tail exposures for accident years 2015 and prior. under this agreement, we ceded to nico 80 percent of the losses on subject business paid on or after january 1, 2016 in excess of $25 billion of net paid losses, up to an aggregate limit of $25 billion. we account for this transaction as retroactive reinsurance. this transaction resulted in a gain, which under gaap retroactive reinsurance accounting is deferred and amortized into income over the settlement period. nico created a collateral trust account as security for their claim payment obligations to us, into which they deposited the consideration paid under the agreement, and berkshire hathaway inc. has provided a parental guarantee to secure nico's obligations under the agreement.

the lines of business subject to this agreement include those with longer tails, which carry a higher degree of uncertainty. since inception, there have been periods of unfavorable prior year development, with more recent favorable development. this agreement will continue to reduce the impact of volatility in the development on our ultimate loss estimates over time. the agreement has resulted in lower capital charges for reserve risks at our u.s. insurance subsidiaries. in addition, net investment income declined as a result of lower invested assets.
fortitude re was established during the first quarter of 2018 in a series of reinsurance transactions related to our run-off operations. those reinsurance transactions were designed to consolidate most of our insurance run-off lines into a single legal entity. as of december 31, 2023, approximately $27.6 billion of reserves from our life and retirement run-off lines and approximately $3.0 billion of reserves from our general insurance run-off lines related to business written by multiple wholly-owned aig subsidiaries, had been ceded to fortitude re under these reinsurance transactions.

update of actuarial assumptions and models the life insurance companies review and update actuarial assumptions at least annually, generally in the third quarter.
investment-oriented products the life insurance companies review and update assumptions used to value our universal life product with secondary guarantees at least annually. these benefit reserves are also adjusted to reflect the changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities with an offset to oci. dac and related items (which may include voba, deferred sales inducements and unearned revenue reserves) are amortized on a constant level basis.
the life insurance companies also review assumptions related to variable annuities, fixed annuities, and fixed index annuities guaranteed benefits that are accounted for as mrbs or embedded derivatives and measured at fair value. the fair value of these mrbs or embedded derivatives is based on actuarial assumptions, including policyholder behavior, as well as capital market assumptions.
traditional long-duration products for traditional long-duration products discussed below, which includes whole life insurance, term life insurance, accident and health insurance, prt, and life-contingent single premium immediate annuities and structured settlements, cash flow assumptions are reviewed at least annually to determine any changes in the liability for future policy benefits. dac and related items (which may include voba) are amortized on a constant level basis.

the life insurance companies recognized favorable impacts to pre-tax income of $22 million, $132 million and $31 million for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, attributable to the annual actuarial assumption review. for the year ended december 31, 2023, the assumption update impacts were primarily driven by updates to the portfolio yield assumption, refinements to the modeling for universal life with secondary guarantees and similar features, and mortality assumption updates, partially offset by updated premium assumptions, and other refinements on life insurance products. for the year ended december 31, 2022, the assumption update impacts were driven by updates to the relationship between projected equity growth and interest rates, and updates to premium and withdrawal assumption for annuities, partially offset by updated investments spreads on life insurance products. for the year ended december 31, 2021, the assumption update impacts were mainly due to updated lapse and mortality expectations for annuities, along with updates to mortality assumptions on traditional life products and updated universal life product reserving methodology.

we recognized favorable impacts to adjusted pre-tax operating income of $22 million, $29 million and $48 million for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, attributable to the annual actuarial assumption review. for the year ended december 31, 2023, the assumption update impacts were primarily driven by updates to the portfolio yield assumption, refinements to the modeling for universal life with secondary guarantees and similar features, and mortality assumption updates, partially offset by updated premium assumptions, and other refinements on life insurance products. for the year ended december 31, 2022, the assumption update impacts were primarily driven by modeling refinements to reflect actual versus expected asset data related to calls and capital gains for life insurance products. for the year ended december 31, 2021, the assumption update impacts were primarily driven by updates to mortality assumptions on traditional life products and updated universal life product reserving methodology.
variable annuity guaranteed benefits and hedging results our individual retirement and group retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with riders that provide guaranteed benefits. the liabilities are accounted for as mrbs and measured at fair value. the fair value of the mrbs may fluctuate significantly based on market interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads, market volatility, policyholder behavior and other factors.
in addition to risk-mitigating features in our variable annuity product design, we have an economic hedging program designed to manage market risk from gmwbs, including exposures to changes in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and volatility. the hedging program includes all in-force gmwb policies and utilizes derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts and interest rate swap and option contracts, as well as fixed maturity securities.
for additional information on market risk management related to these product features, see enterprise risk management - insurance risks - life and retirement companies' key risks - variable annuity, fixed index annuity and index universal life risk management and hedging programs.
differences in valuation of mrbs and economic hedge target the variable annuity hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents an estimate of the underlying economic risks in our gmwb riders. the economic hedge target differs from the gaap valuation of the mrbs, creating volatility in our net income (loss) primarily due to the following:
•the mrbs include both the gmwb riders and the gmdb riders while the hedge program is targeting the economic risks of just the gmwb rider;
•the hedge program is designed to offset moves in the gmwb economic liability and therefore has a lower sensitivity to equity market changes than the mrbs;
•the economic hedge target includes 100 percent of the gmwb rider fees in present value calculations;
•the gaap valuation reflects those fees attributed to the mrbs, such that the initial value at contract issue equals zero. since the mrb includes gmwbs and gmdbs, these attributed fees are typically larger than just the gmwb rider fees;
•the economic hedge target uses best estimate actuarial assumptions and excludes explicit risk margins used for gaap valuation, such as margins for policyholder behavior, mortality, and volatility; and
•the economic hedge target excludes our own credit risk changes (non-performance adjustments) used in the gaap valuation, which are recognized in oci. the gaap valuation has different sensitivities to movements in interest rates and other market factors, and to changes from actuarial assumption updates, than the economic hedge target.
for additional information on our valuation methodology for mrbs, see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | insurance reserves the market value of the hedge portfolio compared to the economic hedge target at any point in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting. in addition to the derivatives held in conjunction with the variable annuity hedging program, the life and retirement companies generally have cash and invested assets available to cover future claims payable under these guarantees. the primary sources of difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target include:
•basis risk due to the variance between expected and actual fund returns, which may be either positive or negative;
•realized volatility versus implied volatility;
•actual versus expected changes in the hedge target driven by assumptions not subject to hedging, particularly policyholder behavior; and
•risk exposures that we have elected not to explicitly or fully hedge.

impact on pre-tax income (loss)
the impact on our pre-tax income (loss) of variable annuity guaranteed benefits and related hedging results includes changes in the fair value of mrbs, and changes in the fair value of related derivative hedging instruments, and along with attributed rider fees and net of benefits associated with mrbs are together recognized in change in the fair value of mrbs, net, with the exception of our own credit risk changes, which are recognized in oci. changes in the fair value of mrbs, net are excluded from adjusted pre-tax income of individual retirement and group retirement.
the change in the fair value of the mrbs and the change in the value of the hedging portfolio are not expected to be fully offsetting, primarily due to the differences in valuation between the economic hedge target, the gaap mrbs and the fair value of the hedging portfolio, as discussed above. when corporate credit spreads widen, the change in the non-performance risk adjustment (npa) spread generally reduces the fair value of the mrbs liabilities, resulting in a gain in aoci, and when corporate credit spreads tighten, the change in the npa spread generally increases the fair value of the mrbs liabilities, resulting in a loss in aoci. in addition to changes driven by credit market-related movements in the npa spread, the npa balance also reflects changes in business activity and in the net amount at risk from the underlying guaranteed living benefits.

liquidity and capital resources of aig parent and subsidiaries aig parent as of december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, respectively, aig parent and applicable intermediate holding companies had approximately $12.1 billion and $8.2 billion in liquidity sources held in the form of cash, short-term investments and aig parent's committed, revolving syndicated credit facility of $4.5 billion. following the initial public offering, corebridge liquidity, including its loan facilities, is not reflected in aig parent's liquidity. as a public company shareholder of corebridge, aig receives its pro rata share of dividends paid by corebridge on corebridge common stock. aig parent's primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from subsidiaries and credit facilities. aig parent's primary uses of liquidity are for debt service, capital and liability management, operating expenses and dividends on aig common stock and series a preferred stock.
we expect to access the debt and preferred equity markets from time to time to meet funding requirements as needed.
we utilize our capital resources to support our businesses, with the majority of capital allocated to our insurance operations. should we have or generate more capital than is needed to support our business strategies (including organic or inorganic growth opportunities) or mitigate risks inherent to our business, we may develop plans to distribute such capital to shareholders via dividends or aig common stock repurchase authorizations or deploy such capital towards liability management.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | liquidity and capital resources insurance companies we expect that our insurance companies will be able to continue to satisfy reasonably foreseeable future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. our insurance companies' liquidity resources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities.
each of our material insurance companies' liquidity is monitored through various internal liquidity risk measures. the primary sources of liquidity are premiums, fees, reinsurance recoverables and investment income and maturities. the primary uses of liquidity are paid losses, reinsurance payments, benefit claims, surrenders, withdrawals, interest payments, dividends, expenses, investment purchases and collateral requirements.
our insurance companies may require additional funding to meet capital or liquidity needs under certain circumstances. for example, large catastrophes may require us to provide additional support to the affected operations of our general insurance companies, and a shift in interest rates may require us to provide support to the affected operations of our life and retirement companies.
certain of our u.s. life and retirement insurance companies are members of the fhlbs in their respective districts. our borrowings from fhlbs are non-puttable and are used to supplement liquidity or for other uses deemed appropriate by management. our u.s. life and retirement companies had $5.7 billion and $4.6 billion which were due to fhlbs in their respective districts at december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, respectively, under funding agreements issued through our individual retirement, group retirement and institutional markets operating segments, which were reported in policyholder contract deposits. proceeds from funding agreements are generally invested in fixed income securities and other investments intended to generate spread income.
certain of our u.s. life and retirement companies have securities lending programs that lend securities from their investment portfolio to supplement liquidity or for other uses as deemed appropriate by management. under these programs, these companies lend securities to financial institutions and receive cash as collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities. as of december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022 we had no loans outstanding under these programs.
aig parent and/or certain subsidiaries are parties to several letter of credit agreements with various financial institutions, which issue letters of credit from time to time in support of our insurance companies. these letters of credit are subject to reimbursement by aig parent and/or certain subsidiaries in the event of a drawdown of these letters of credit. letters of credit issued in support of the general insurance companies totaled approximately $2.4 billion at december 31, 2023. letters of credit issued in support of the life and retirement companies totaled approximately $151 million at december 31, 2023, which are subject to reimbursement by corebridge with no recourse to aig parent.
following the initial public offering of corebridge, aig owned less than 80 percent of corebridge common stock, resulting in the tax deconsolidation of corebridge from aig. as such, as of september 15, 2022, aig no longer receives tax sharing payments from corebridge for tax liabilities of subsequent periods. with respect to historic tax periods and tax periods prior to the tax deconsolidation of corebridge from aig, corebridge and aig will make tax payments to each other pursuant to the tax matters agreement, dated september 14, 2022.
credit facilities aig parent maintains a committed, revolving syndicated credit facility (the facility) with aggregate commitments by the bank syndicate to provide aig parent with unsecured revolving loans and/or standby letters of credit of up to $4.5 billion without any limits on the type of borrowings. the facility is scheduled to expire in november 2026.
our ability to utilize the facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the facility. these include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization. failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the facility would restrict our access to the facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
as of december 31, 2023, a total of $4.5 billion remained available under the facility.
corebridge maintains a committed, revolving syndicated credit facility (the corebridge facility) with aggregate commitments by the bank syndicate to provide corebridge with unsecured revolving loans and/or standby letters of credit of up to $2.5 billion without any limits on the type of borrowings and with no recourse to aig parent. the corebridge facility is scheduled to expire in may 2027.
as of december 31, 2023, a total of $2.5 billion remained available under the corebridge facility.
corebridge also maintains the ddtl facility, which is scheduled to mature in february 2025. as of december 31, 2023, a total of $250 million of borrowings are outstanding under the ddtl facility, with no recourse to aig parent.

loss reserves loss reserves relate to our general insurance companies and represent estimates of future loss and loss adjustment expense payments based on historical loss development payment patterns. the amounts presented in the above table are undiscounted and therefore exceed the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including allowance for credit losses, as presented on the consolidated balance sheets. due to the significance of the assumptions used, the payments by period presented above could be materially different from actual required payments. we believe that our general insurance companies maintain adequate financial resources to meet the actual required payments under these obligations.

we are party to some agreements that contain "ratings triggers." depending on the ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies, these triggers could result in (i) the termination or limitation of credit availability or a requirement for accelerated repayment, (ii) the termination of business contracts or (iii) a requirement to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties.
in the event of a downgrade of aig's long-term senior debt ratings, certain aig entities would be required to post additional collateral under some derivative and other transactions, or certain of the counterparties of such aig entities would be permitted to terminate such transactions early.
the actual amount of collateral that we would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that we could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade.

aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management enterprise risk management overview risk management is an integral part of our business strategy and a key element of our approach to corporate governance. we have an integrated process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm-wide risk appetite. our board of directors has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. our enterprise risk management (erm) department oversees and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of aig's major risk positions. erm embeds risk management in our key day-to-day business processes. nevertheless, our risk management efforts may not always be successful and material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or financial condition may occur. for further information regarding the risks associated with our business and operations, see part i, item 1a. risk factors.
aig employs a three lines of defense model. aig's business leaders assume full accountability for the risks and controls in their segments, and erm performs a review, challenge and oversight function. the third line consists of our internal audit group that provides independent assurance to aig's board of directors.
risk governance structure our risk governance structure is designed to foster the development and maintenance of a risk and control culture that encompasses all significant risk categories impacting our lines of business and functions. accountability for the implementation and oversight of risk policies is aligned with individual business leaders, with the risk committees' oversight.
our board of directors oversees the management of risk through its risk committee and audit committee. our chief risk officer (cro), a member of the executive leadership team, reports to both the risk committee and our chairman and chief executive officer. the aig cro chairs the group risk committee (grc), the senior management group responsible for assessing all significant risks on a global basis. the grc is supported by management committees including the business unit risk committees and legal entity risk committees.
risk appetite, limits, identification and measurement risk appetite framework approved by our board of directors, aig's risk appetite framework integrates stakeholder interests, strategic business goals and available financial resources. we balance these by seeking to take measured risks that are expected to generate repeatable, sustainable earnings and create long-term value for our shareholders. our risk tolerances take into consideration regulatory requirements, rating agency expectations, and business needs.
risk limits a key component of our risk appetite framework is the establishment and maintenance of tolerances and limits on material risks to meet aig's objectives. to support the monitoring and management of material risks, erm employs a three-tiered hierarchy consisting of board-level risk tolerances, aig management level limits, and business unit and legal entity level limits. board-level risk tolerances define the minimum level of consolidated capital and liquidity we should maintain, which are approved by the board of directors and monitored by the risk committee. aig management level limits are risk type specific limits at the aig consolidated level, which are approved by the aig cro with consultation from the grc. business unit and legal entity level limits address key risks identified for the business units and legal entities.
risk identification and measurement we conduct risk identification through multiple processes at the business unit and corporate level focused on capturing our material risks. a key initiative is our integrated bottom-up risk identification and assessment process which is conducted down to the product-line level. in addition, we perform an annual top-down risk assessment to identify top risks and assign owners to ensure these risks are appropriately addressed and managed. these processes are used as critical input to enhance and develop our analytics for measuring and assessing risks across the organization.
the internal capital framework quantifies our aggregate economic risk at a given confidence interval, after considering diversification benefits between risk factors and business lines. the stress testing framework assesses our aggregate exposure to our most significant financial and insurance risks. we use this information to support the assessment of resources needed at the aig parent level to support our subsidiaries and capital resources required to maintain consolidated company target capitalization levels.

•credit risk management       •liquidity risk management          •insurance risks
•market risk management       •operational risk management        •business and strategy risks credit risk management credit risk is defined as the risk that our customers or counterparties are unable or unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they become due. credit risk may also result from a downgrade of a counterparty's credit ratings or a widening of its credit spreads.
direct and indirect credit exposures may arise from, but are not limited to, fixed income investments, equity securities, deposits, commercial paper investments, securities purchased under agreements to resell and repurchase agreements, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance and retrocessional insurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees, letters of credit, and certain general insurance businesses. our credit risk framework incorporates risk identification and measurement, risk limits, risk delegations to authorized credit professionals throughout the company, and credit reserving. credit reserving includes but is not limited to the development of a proper framework, policies and procedures for establishing accurate identification of (i) reserves for credit losses and (ii) other than temporary impairments for securities portfolios.
we monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. to minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require mitigants, such as third-party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, including commercial bank-issued letters of credit and trust collateral accounts.
for additional information on our credit concentrations and credit exposures, see investments - credit ratings - available-for-sale investments.
derivative transactions we utilize derivatives principally to enable us to hedge exposure associated with changes in levels of interest rates, currencies, credit, commodities, equity prices and other risks. credit risk associated with derivative counterparties exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to us. all derivative transactions must be transacted within counterparty limits that have been approved by erm. we evaluate counterparty credit quality via an internal analysis that is consistent with the aig credit policy and, where necessary, we require credit enhancements for certain transactions and enter into offsetting and netting arrangements.
for additional information related to derivative transactions, see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
market risk management market risk is defined as the risk of adverse impact due to systemic movements in one or more of the following market risk drivers: equity and commodity prices, residential and commercial real estate values, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange, inflation, and their respective levels of volatility. we are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets activities, on both the asset and the liability sides of our balance sheet through on- and off-balance sheet exposures.
market risk is overseen at the corporate level within erm through the cro. market risk is managed by our finance, treasury and investment management corporate functions, collectively, and in partnership with erm. the scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is monitored through multiple lenses that include economic, gaap and statutory reporting frameworks at various levels of business consolidation, in a manner consistent with our risk appetite statement. this process aims to establish a comprehensive coverage of potential implications from adverse market risk developments. we use a number of approaches to measure market risk exposure including sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis and stress testing.

(d)the balance sheet exposures for equity contracts and variable annuity and other embedded derivatives are also reflected under "interest rate sensitive liabilities" above, and are not additive.
(e)the majority of the foreign currency exposure is reported on a one quarter lag. foreign currency-denominated net asset position reflects our aggregated non-u.s. dollar assets less our aggregated non-u.s. dollar liabilities on a gaap basis, with certain adjustments.
interest rate sensitivity is defined as the change in value with respect to a 100 basis point parallel shift up in the interest rate environment, calculated as: scenario value minus base value, where base value is the value under the yield curves as of the period end and scenario value is the value reflecting a 100 basis point parallel increase in all yield curves.
we evaluate our interest rate risk without considering effects of correlation of changes in levels of interest rate with other key market risks or other assumptions used for calculating the values of our financial assets and liabilities.
we evaluate our equity price risk without considering effects of correlation of changes in equity prices with other key market risks or other assumptions used for calculating the values of our financial assets and liabilities, as the stress scenario does not reflect the impact of basis risk which we use in the development of our hedging strategy.
for additional information on our three-tiered hierarchy of limits, see - risk appetite, limits, identification and measurement - risk limits.
liquidity risk management liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral or other financial obligations as they come due.
aig and its legal entities seek to maintain sufficient liquidity both during the normal course of business and under defined liquidity stress scenarios to ensure that sufficient cash will be available to meet the obligations as they come due.
aig parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are designed to allow us to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six months under a liquidity stress scenario. we maintain liquidity limits and minimum coverage ratios designed to ensure that funding needs are met under stress conditions. liquidity risk drivers include market/monetization risk, cash flow mismatch risk, event funding risk, and financing risk.
liquidity risk is monitored through comprehensive cash flow projections over varying time horizons that incorporate all relevant liquidity sources and uses and include known and likely cash inflows and outflows. we use several approaches to measure liquidity risk exposure including minimum liquidity limits, coverage ratios, coverage flow forecasts and stress testing.
operational risk management operational risk is defined as the risk of loss, or other adverse consequences, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or from external events. operational risk includes legal, regulatory, technology, compliance, third-party and business continuity risks, but excludes business and strategy risks.
operational risk is inherent in each of our business units and functions and can have many impacts, including but not limited to, unexpected economic losses or gains, reputational harm due to negative publicity, regulatory action from supervisory agencies and operational and business disruptions, and/or damage to customer relationships.
the operational risk management (orm) function within erm oversees adherence to the operational risk policy and risk and control framework.
orm, working together with other control and assurance functions and first line risk control owners through the risk and control framework, provides an independent view of operational risks for each of the business areas.
cybersecurity risk aig, like other global companies, continues to witness the increased sophistication and activities of unauthorized parties attempting cyber and other computer-related penetrations such as "denial of service" attacks, phishing, untargeted but sophisticated and automated attacks, and other disruptive software in an effort to compromise systems, networks and obtain sensitive information.
erm works closely with and supports the risk management practices of information technology, the information security office and the business units and functions that form the lines of defense against the cybersecurity risks that we face.

aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management insurance risks insurance risk is defined as the risk of actual claims experience and/or policyholder behavior being materially different than initially expected at the inception of an insurance contract. uncertainties related to insurance risk can lead to deviations in magnitude and/or timing of prospective cash flows associated with our liabilities compared to what we expected.
we manage our business risk oversight activities through our insurance operations. a primary goal in managing our insurance operations is to achieve an acceptable risk-adjusted return on equity. to achieve this goal, we must be disciplined in risk selection, premium adequacy, and appropriate terms and conditions to cover the risk accepted.
we operate our insurance businesses on a global basis, and we are exposed to a wide variety of risks with different time horizons. we manage these risks throughout the organization, both centrally and locally, through a number of processes and procedures, including but not limited to, pricing and risk selection models, pricing approval processes, pre-launch approval of product design, development, and distribution, underwriting approval processes and authorities, modeling and reporting of aggregations and limit concentrations at multiple levels, model risk management framework and validation processes, risk transfer tools, review and challenge of reserves, actuarial profitability and reserve reviews, management of the relationship between assets and liabilities, and experience monitoring and assumption updates.
we closely manage insurance risk by monitoring and controlling the nature and geographic location of the risks in each underwritten line of business, concentrations in industries, the terms and conditions of the underwriting and the premiums we charge for taking on the risk. we analyze concentrations of risks using various modeling techniques, including both probability distributions (stochastic) and/or single-point estimates (deterministic) approaches.
risk measurement, monitoring and limits we use several approaches to measure our insurance risk exposure including sensitivity and scenario analyses, stochastic methods, and experience studies. additionally, there are risk-specific assessment tools, both internal and third-party, in place to better manage the variety of insurance risks to which we are exposed.
for additional information on our three-tiered hierarchy of limits, see - risk appetite, limits, identification and measurement - risk limits.
general insurance companies' key risks we manage our risks through risk review and selection processes, exposure limitations, exclusions, deductibles, self-insured retentions, coverage limits, attachment points, and reinsurance. this management is supported by sound underwriting practices, pricing procedures and the use of actuarial analysis to help determine overall adequacy of provisions for insurance.
for general insurance companies, risks primarily include loss reserves, underwriting, catastrophe exposure, single risk loss exposure, and reinsurance. the potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the general insurance companies, which we manage through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. for further information, see critical accounting estimates - loss reserves.
the potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the general insurance companies' ability to achieve an underwriting profit. we develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit.
our business is exposed to various catastrophic events, including natural disasters, man-made catastrophes, or pandemic disease, in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year, adversely affecting our business and operating results. concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.
our business is exposed to loss events, such as fires or explosions, that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. the net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by the chief underwriting officer through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance.
since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the recoverability of expected payments from reinsurers due to either an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated, which is monitored through our credit risk management framework.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management natural catastrophe risk we manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate probable maximum loss (pml) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, modifying our gross underwriting standards, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.
we use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures with adjustments applied to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.
we recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. with multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policies to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning and will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change. in addition, we provide insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change.
the table below details our modeled estimates of pml, net of reinsurance, on an annual aggregate basis. the 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 pmls are the annual aggregate probable maximum losses with probability of 1 percent and 0.4 percent in a year, respectively. estimates as of december 31, 2023 reflect our in-force portfolio for exposures as of october 1, 2023, and all inuring reinsurance covers as of december 31, 2023, except for the catastrophe reinsurance programs, which are as of january 1, 2024 and reflected as of such date.

aig, along with other property casualty insurance and reinsurance companies, uses industry-recognized catastrophe models and applies proprietary modeling processes and assumptions to arrive at loss estimates. the use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially change the projected losses, and our modeled losses may not be comparable to estimates made by other companies.
also, the modeled results are based on the assumption that all reinsurers fulfill their obligations to us under the terms of the reinsurance arrangements. these estimates are inherently uncertain and may not accurately reflect our net exposure, inclusive of credit risk, to these events.
our 2024 property catastrophe reinsurance program is a worldwide program providing both aggregate and per occurrence protection, with differing per occurrence and aggregate retentions for north america, japan, and rest of world. in 2024, we purchased our north america property catastrophe reinsurance program with several coverage enhancements and unchanged attachment points of $500 million for the commercial portfolio and $300 million for lexington insurance company and programs business. for international, we reduced our japan attachment point to $150 million and rest of world remained unchanged at $125 million.
we have also purchased property per risk covers that provide protection against large losses globally, which include those emanating from non-critical catastrophe events (all events except for named windstorm and earthquake) globally as well as critical catastrophe events (named windstorm and earthquake) outside north america.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management actual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios. the occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
for additional information, see also part 1, item 1a. risk factors - reserves and exposures.
terrorism risk we actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model for various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the general insurance companies' exposures.
our largest terrorism concentrations are in new york city, and estimated losses are largely driven by the property and workers' compensation lines of business. our exposure to terrorism risk in the u.s. is mitigated by the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act (tripra) in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. tripra covers certified terrorist attacks within the u.s. or u.s. missions and against certain u.s. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law.
we offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. international terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. we also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-u.s. jurisdictions.
life and retirement companies' key risks for life and retirement companies, risks include longevity risk, morbidity risk, mortality (including pandemic) risk, and policyholder behavior risk (including full and partial surrender lapses). the emergence of significant adverse experience compared to the experience we expected and priced for could require an adjustment to benefit reserves and/or dac, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations for a particular period.
we manage risk through product design, experience monitoring, pricing and underwriting discipline, risk limits and thresholds, reinsurance and active monitoring and management of the alignment between risk and cash flow profiles of assets and liabilities, and hedging instruments.
for additional information on the impact of actual and expected experience on dac and benefit reserves, see critical accounting estimates - future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and critical accounting estimates - market risk benefits. for additional information on business risks, see part i, item 1a. risk factors - business and operations.
variable annuity, fixed index annuity and index universal life risk management and hedging programs our individual and group retirement businesses offer variable and fixed index annuity products with guaranteed living benefit (glb) riders that guarantee a certain level of lifetime benefits. under current gaap rules, variable and certain index annuity glbs are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value recorded in other realized gains (losses). glb features subject the life and retirement companies to market risk, including exposure to changes in levels of interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility.
risk mitigation features of our variable annuity product designs include glb rider fees indexed to a broad equity market volatility index, required minimum allocations to fixed accounts to reduce overall equity exposure, and for some of the variable annuity products, the utilization of volatility control funds.
we utilize asset liability management and hedging programs to manage economic exposure to market risks that are not fully mitigated through product designs. our hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target established via a stochastic projection for policyholder behavior in conjunction with market scenarios calibrated to observable equity and interest option prices, which represents our estimate of the underlying economic risks in the embedded derivatives.
in designing the hedging portfolio for our variable annuity hedging program, we make assumptions that are used in projections of future performance of the underlying mutual funds elected by the variable annuity policyholders. basis risk exists due to the variance between funds returns projected under these assumptions and actual fund returns, which may result in variances between changes in the value of the hedging portfolio and changes in the economic value of the hedge liability target. our hedging programs associated with index annuity and index universal life products are designed to manage market risk associated with the index crediting strategies offered on these product platforms.
to manage the capital market exposures embedded within the economic liability hedge targets, we identify and hedge market sensitivities to changes in equity markets, interest rates, volatility and for variable annuities, credit spreads. each hedge program purchases derivative instruments or securities having sensitivities that offset corresponding sensitivities in the associated economic hedge targets, within internally defined threshold limits.
aig | 2023 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management our hedging programs utilize various derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts, interest rate swaps and swaptions. in addition, within the variable annuities hedging program, we purchase certain fixed income securities classified as available for sale.
the hedging programs are monitored on a daily basis to ensure that the economic liability hedge targets and the associated derivative portfolios stay within the threshold limits, pursuant to the approved hedging strategies. in addition, monthly stress tests are performed to determine the program's effectiveness relative to the applicable limits, under an array of combined severe market stresses in equity prices, interest rates, volatility and credit spreads. finally, hedging strategies are reviewed regularly to gauge their effectiveness in managing our market exposures in the context of our overall risk appetite.
for information on the impact on our consolidated pre-tax income from the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives and the hedging portfolio, as well as additional discussion of differences between the economic hedge target and the valuation of the embedded derivatives, see insurance reserves - life and annuity future policy benefits, policyholder contract deposits and market risk benefits - variable annuity guaranteed benefits and hedging results.
reinsurance activities we purchase reinsurance for our insurance and reinsurance operations. reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning. we may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis.
reinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss (life and non-life) exposure related to certain events, such as natural and man-made catastrophes, death events, or single policy level events. our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. in addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.
reinsurance contracts do not relieve our subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. however, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.
reinsurance recoverable aig's reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of paid losses recoverable, ceded loss reserves, ceded reserves for unearned premiums, and life and annuity reinsurance recoverables (ceded policy and claim reserves and policyholder contract deposits).
at december 31, 2023, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $67.5 billion. these assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $4.6 billion, ceded loss reserves of $30.4 billion including reserves for ibnr claims, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $4.3 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverable of $28.2 billion. the methods used to estimate ibnr and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. these methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. any adjustments are reflected in income. we believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at december 31, 2023 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. actual losses may, however, differ from the reserves currently ceded.
at december 31, 2023, we held $70.1 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers.
at december 31, 2023, we had no significant reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. reduced profitability associated with lower interest rates, market volatility and catastrophe losses (including covid-19), could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers. the reinsurance credit department, in conjunction with the credit executives within erm, reviews these developments, monitors compliance with credit triggers that may require aig's reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.

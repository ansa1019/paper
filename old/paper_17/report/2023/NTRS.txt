item 1a - risk factors in the normal course of our business activities, we are exposed to a variety of risks. the following discussion sets forth the risk factors that we have identified as being most significant to northern trust. although we discuss these risk factors primarily in the context of their potential effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations, you should understand that these effects can have further negative implications such as: reducing the price of our common stock and other securities; reducing our capital, which can have regulatory and other consequences; affecting the confidence that clients, counterparties and/or applicable regulators have in us, with a resulting negative effect on our ability to conduct and grow our businesses; and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to rating agencies and potential purchasers, which may affect adversely our ability to raise capital and secure other funding or the cost at which we are able to do so. additional risks beyond those discussed below, elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k or in other of our reports filed with, or furnished to, the sec also could affect us adversely. further, we cannot assure you that the risk factors herein or elsewhere in our other reports address all potential risks that we may face and you should not interpret discussion of any risk to imply that such risk has not already materialized.
these risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this annual report on form 10-k. forward-looking statements and other factors that may affect future results are discussed under "forward-looking statements" included in item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."

2023 annual report | northern trust corporation market risks we are dependent on fee-based business for a majority of our revenues, which may be affected adversely by market volatility, a downturn in economic conditions, underperformance and/or negative trends in investment preferences.
our principal operational focus is on fee-based business, which is distinct from commercial banking institutions that earn most of their revenues from loans and other traditional interest-generating products and services. fees for many of our products and services are based on the market value of assets under management, custody or administration; the volume of transactions processed; securities lending volume and spreads; fees for other services rendered; and in certain businesses, fees calculated as a percentage of our clients' earnings, all of which may be impacted negatively by market volatility, a downturn in economic conditions, underperformance and/or negative trends in investment preferences. for example, downturns in equity markets and decreases in the value of debt-related investments resulting from market disruption, illiquidity or other factors historically have reduced the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others, which generally impacted our earnings negatively. further, although we do not hold, invest in, or custody cryptocurrency assets, the markets in which they trade are highly volatile and volatility in these markets may impact the markets for other assets that we hold, invest in, or custody, which could also impact our fees or financial condition. market volatility and/or weak economic conditions also may affect wealth creation, investment preferences, trading activities, and savings patterns, which impact demand for certain products and services that we provide.
our earnings also may be affected by poor investment returns or changes in investment preferences driven by factors beyond market volatility or weak economic conditions. poor absolute or relative investment performance in funds or client accounts that we manage or in investment products that we design or provide may result in declines in the market values of portfolios that we manage and/or administer and may affect our ability to retain existing assets and to attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients. for example, from time to time in the past, outflows from certain of our products driven by relative investment performance or other factors adversely impacted our overall fees derived from assets that we manage. broader changes in investment preferences that lead to less investment in mutual funds or other collective funds, such as the shift in investor preference to lower fee products, could also impact our earnings negatively.
changes in interest rates can affect our earnings negatively.
the direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings. interest rate changes could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities. in response to rising inflation, the federal reserve board increased interest rates from historically low levels during 2022 and 2023. while a rising interest rate environment generally has a positive effect on our net interest margin, in some circumstances, a rise in interest rates also may affect us negatively. for example, the rapid increases in interest rates during 2022 and 2023 adversely impacted the value of certain of our investment securities, with resultant impacts on our capital, liquidity, and earnings. additionally, higher interest rates historically have caused, and may in the future cause: market volatility and downturns in equity markets, resulting in a decrease in the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others, which generally impact our earnings negatively; our clients to transfer funds into investments with higher rates of return, resulting in decreased deposit levels and higher fund or account redemptions; our borrowers to experience difficulties in making higher interest payments, resulting in increased credit costs, provisions for loan and lease losses and charge-offs; reduced bond and fixed income fund liquidity, resulting in lower performance, yields and fees; or higher funding costs.
conversely, low-interest-rate environments generally result in a compressed net interest margin and also have a negative impact on our fees earned on certain of our products. for example, in the past we waived certain fees associated with money market funds due to the low level of short-term interest rates. low net interest margins and fee waivers each negatively impact our earnings.
although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of interest rate risks, if our assumptions about any number of variables are incorrect, these policies and procedures to mitigate risk may be ineffective, which could impact earnings negatively.
please see "market risk" in the "risk management" section included in item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations," for a more detailed discussion of interest rate and market risks we face.
changes in the monetary, trade and other policies of various regulatory authorities, central banks, governments and international agencies may reduce our earnings and affect our growth prospects negatively.
the monetary, trade and other policies of u.s. and international governments, agencies and regulatory bodies have a significant impact on economic conditions and overall financial market performance. for example, the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money and credit in the u.s. through quantitative tightening and/or easing, and its policies determine in large part the level of interest rates and our cost of funds for lending and investing, and play a role in contributing to or moderating levels of inflation, all of which meaningfully impact our earnings. further, their policies can affect our borrowers by increasing interest rates or making sources of funding less available, which may increase the risk that borrowers fail to repay their loans from us. changes in monetary, trade and other governmental policies are beyond our
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation control and can be difficult to predict, and we cannot determine the ultimate effect that any such changes would have upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.
macroeconomic conditions and uncertainty in the global economy, including the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe, including the risk of defaults on sovereign debt and related stresses on financial markets, could have a significant adverse effect on our earnings.
risks and concerns about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe could have a detrimental impact on economic and market conditions in these or other markets across the world. foreign market and economic disruptions have affected, and may in the future affect, consumer confidence levels and spending, international trade policy, personal bankruptcy rates, levels of incurrence of and default on consumer debt, and home prices. additionally, financial markets may be adversely affected by the liquidity or capital deficiencies (actual or perceived) of financial institutions and related industry and government actions, current or anticipated impact of military conflict (including the continuing military conflicts involving ukraine and the russian federation and israel and hamas and other evolving events in the middle east), terrorism, political or civil unrest, public health epidemics or pandemics, the exit or potential exit of one or more countries from the eu, sovereign debt downgrades or debt crises, or other geopolitical events. for example, developments related to the u.s. federal debt ceiling, including the possibility of a government shutdown, default by the u.s. government on its debt obligations, or related credit-rating downgrades, could have adverse effects on the broader economy, disrupt access to capital markets, and contribute to, or worsen, an economic recession. the cumulative effect of uncertain business conditions or economic challenges faced in various foreign markets, including fiscal or monetary concerns, economic downturns and the possibility of a recession in some jurisdictions, other economic factors (including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and changes to tax laws or the application or enforcement practices of such laws), or volatility or lack of confidence in the financial markets may adversely affect certain portions of our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can affect us negatively.
our investment securities portfolio represents a greater proportion, and our loan portfolio represents a smaller proportion, of our total consolidated assets in comparison to many other financial institutions. the value of securities available for sale and held to maturity within our investment portfolio, which is generally determined based upon market values available from third-party sources, have fluctuated, and may continue in the future to fluctuate, as a result of market volatility and economic or financial market conditions. for example, in 2023, and again in early 2024, we realized notable losses on the sale of available for sale securities and we may realize additional losses in the future. declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio negatively impact our levels of capital, liquidity, and, to the extent we realize losses, earnings. although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of market risks, including hedging-related strategies, those policies and procedures are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks. accordingly, market risks have, from time to time, negatively affected the value of securities held in our investment portfolio and in the future we could suffer additional adverse effects as a result of our failure to anticipate and manage these risks properly.
volatility levels and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our earnings.
we provide foreign exchange services to our clients, primarily in connection with our global custody business. foreign currency volatility influences our foreign exchange trading income as does the level of client activity. foreign currency volatility and changes in client activity may result in reduced foreign exchange trading income. fluctuations in exchange rates may raise the potential for losses resulting from foreign currency trading positions where aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the u.s. dollar do not offset each other or offset each other in different time periods. we also are exposed to non-trading foreign currency risk as a result of our holdings of non-u.s. dollar denominated assets and liabilities, investments in non-u.s. subsidiaries, and future non-u.s. dollar denominated revenue and expense.
we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of foreign exchange risks, including hedging-related strategies. any failure or circumvention of our procedures to mitigate risk may impact earnings negatively. please see "market risk" in the "risk management" section included in item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations," for a more detailed discussion of market risks we face.
changes in a number of particular market conditions can affect our earnings negatively.
in past periods, reductions in the volatility of currency-trading markets, the level of cross-border investing activity, and the demand for borrowing securities or willingness to lend such securities have affected our earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and securities lending negatively. if these conditions occur in the future, our earnings from these activities may be affected negatively. in certain of our businesses, such as securities lending, our fee is calculated as a percentage of our clients' earnings, such that market and other factors that reduce our clients' earnings from investments or trading activities also reduce our revenues.
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation operational risks many types of operational risks can affect our earnings negatively.
we regularly assess and monitor operational risk in our businesses. despite our efforts to assess and monitor operational risk, our risk management program may not be effective in all cases. factors that can impact operations and expose us to risks varying in size, scale and scope, some or all of which may be exacerbated by the trend toward hybrid and remote working arrangements in recent years, include:
•failures of technological systems or networks or breaches of security measures, including, but not limited to, those resulting from computer viruses, cyber-attacks or other information security incidents;
•human errors or omissions, including failures to comply with applicable laws or corporate policies and procedures;
•theft, fraud or misappropriation of assets, whether arising from the intentional actions of internal personnel or external third parties;
•defects or interruptions in computer or communications systems;
•breakdowns in processes and internal controls; over-reliance on manual processes and controls, which are less scalable than automated processes and controls;
•failures of the systems and facilities that support our operations;
•failure of any third-party vendor to properly execute the processes on which northern trust relies;
•unsuccessful or difficult implementation of computer systems upgrades;
•defects in product design or delivery;
•difficulty in accurately pricing assets, which can be aggravated by market volatility and illiquidity and lack of reliable pricing from third-party vendors;
•negative developments in relationships with key counterparties, third-party vendors, employees or associates in our day-to-day operations; and
•external events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as pandemics, geopolitical events, political or social unrest, natural disasters or acts of terrorism.
while we have in place many controls and business continuity plans designed to address many of these factors, these plans may not operate successfully to mitigate these risks effectively. we also may fail to identify or fully understand the implications and risks associated with changes in the financial markets or our businesses-particularly as our geographic footprint, product pipeline and client needs and expectations evolve-and consequently fail to enhance our controls and business continuity plans to address those changes in an adequate or timely fashion. if our controls and business continuity plans do not address the factors noted above and operate to mitigate the associated risks successfully, such factors may have a negative impact on our business (including operational resilience), financial condition or results of operations. in addition, an important aspect of managing our operational risk is creating a risk culture in which all employees fully understand the inherent risk in our business and the importance of managing risk as it relates to their job functions. we continue to enhance our risk management program to support our risk culture, ensuring that it is sustainable and appropriate for our role as a major financial institution. nonetheless, if we fail to provide the appropriate environment that sensitizes all of our employees to managing risk, our business could be impacted adversely. please see "other risks" in this "risk factors" section for further description of risks associated with the systems and models we employ to analyze, monitor and mitigate risks.
we are highly dependent on information technology systems and networks, many of which are operated by third parties, and any failures of, or disruptions to, our or such third parties' technological systems or networks could materially and adversely affect our business.
our business is dependent on our and third parties' information technology systems and networks. any failure, interruption or breach in the security of any such systems or networks could severely disrupt our operations and could subject us to liability claims, harm our reputation, interrupt our operations, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
additionally, our computer, communications, data processing, networks, backup, business continuity or other operating, information or technology systems, including those that we outsource to providers, may fail to operate properly or become disabled, overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which could have a negative effect on our ability to conduct our business activities.
the third parties with which we do business also are susceptible to the foregoing risks (including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely), and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be affected adversely, perhaps materially, by failures, terminations, errors or malfeasance by, or attacks or constraints on, one or more financial, technology, infrastructure or government institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business.
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation our business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system, network or operational failure or disruption.
breaches of our security measures, including, but not limited to, those resulting from cyber-attacks or other information security incidents, may result in losses.
our systems involve the storage, transmission and other processing of clients' and our personal, proprietary, confidential and sensitive information, and security breaches, including cyber-attacks or other information security incidents, could expose us to a risk of theft, loss, destruction, gathering, monitoring, dissemination, misappropriation, misuse, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to this information. despite our implementation of a variety of security measures, our computer systems, networks, and data, including clients' or our personal, proprietary, confidential and sensitive information, could be subject to cyber-attacks or other information security incidents, such as, among other things, from physical and electronic break-ins or unauthorized tampering, malware and computer virus attacks, ransomware attacks, social engineering attacks (including phishing attacks) or denial-of-service attacks. our security measures also may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, failure of our controls with respect to access to our systems, malfeasance or otherwise. any failure, interruption or breach in the security of our systems could severely disrupt our operations and could subject us to liability claims, harm our reputation, interrupt our operations, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
data privacy and security risks for large financial institutions like us are significant in part because of the evolving proliferation of new technologies, the use of internet-based solutions, mobile devices, and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and rapidly evolving techniques of hackers, terrorists, organized crime and other external parties, including foreign state actors and state-sponsored actors, any of which may see their effectiveness enhanced by the use of artificial intelligence. data privacy and security risks also may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third parties, or may result from human error, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failure or other technological failure. if we fail to continue to upgrade our technology infrastructure to ensure effective data privacy and security relative to the type, size and complexity of our operations, we could become more vulnerable to cyber-attacks and other information security incidents and, consequently, subject to significant regulatory penalties and reputational damage. also, like many large enterprises, the trend in the past several years toward a hybrid work environment that includes a combination of in-office and remote work creates a broader attack surface for, and potential vulnerabilities from, cyber threats.
while we generally conduct security assessments on third-party vendors, we cannot be certain that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyber-attack or other information security incident. some of our vendors may store or have access to our data and may not have effective controls, processes, or practices to protect our information from loss, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized use or misappropriation, cyber-attacks or other information security incidents. in addition, our clients often use personal devices, such as computers, smart phones and tablets, which are particularly vulnerable to loss and theft, as well as third parties with whom they share information used for authentication, to access our systems and networks and manage their accounts, which may heighten the risk of system failures, interruptions or security breaches.
moreover, the increased use of mobile and cloud technologies could heighten these and other operational risks. reliance on mobile or cloud technology or any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and networks and prevent cyber-attacks or other information security incidents could disrupt our operations or the operations of our or their service providers and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of personal, confidential, proprietary, or other sensitive information or the inability to conduct ordinary business operations. in addition, there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures may be circumvented, particularly to the extent that new computing technologies increase the speed and computing power available. a vulnerability in our service providers' software or systems, a failure of our service providers' safeguards, policies or procedures, or a cyber-attack or other information security incident affecting any of these third parties could harm our business.
in recent years, several financial services firms suffered successful cyber-attacks launched both domestically and from abroad, resulting in the disruption of services to clients, loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private information, and reputational harm. we and our clients have been, and expect to continue to be, subject to a wide variety of cyber-attacks and other similar threats, including computer viruses, ransomware and other malicious code, distributed denial-of-service attacks, and phishing and vishing attacks, and it is possible that we could suffer material losses resulting from a breach. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems and networks change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, to implement adequate preventative measures, or to address them until they are discovered. in addition, successful cyber-attacks may persist for an extended period of time before being detected. because any investigation of an information security incident would be inherently unpredictable, the extent of a particular information security incident and the path of investigating the incident may not be immediately clear. it may take a significant amount of time before such an
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident is known. while such an investigation is ongoing, we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, and communication to the public, regulators, clients and other stakeholders may be inaccurate, any or all of which could further increase the costs and consequences of an information security incident.
we could be the subject of legal claims or proceedings related to information security incidents, including regulatory investigations and other legal actions, carrying the potential for damages, fines, sanctions or other penalties, injunctive relief requiring costly compliance measures and reputational damage. further, the market perception of the effectiveness of our information security measures could be harmed, our reputation could suffer and we could lose clients in conjunction with security incidents, each of which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. a breach of our security also may affect adversely our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our business. an event that results in the loss of information also may require us to reconstruct lost data or reimburse clients for data and credit monitoring services, which could be costly and have a negative impact on our business and reputation. although we maintain insurance coverage in the event of information theft, damage, or destruction from cyber-attacks or other information security incidents, there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we may incur will be covered under such policies, that the amount of insurance will be adequate to cover such losses, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that our insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.
further, even if not directed at us, attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system or on our counterparties could affect, directly or indirectly, aspects of our business.
errors, breakdowns in controls or other mistakes in the provision of services to clients or in carrying out transactions for our own account can subject us to liability, result in losses or have a negative effect on our earnings in other ways.
in our asset servicing, investment management, fiduciary administration and other business activities, we effect or process transactions for clients and for ourselves that involve very large amounts of money. failure to manage or mitigate operational risks properly can have adverse consequences, and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the magnitude of resulting losses. further, remote working and other modified business practices initiated in recent years, combined with the increasing sophistication and frequency of potential cyber-attacks and other information security incidents, have heightened our operational and execution risk. given the high volume of transactions we process, errors that affect earnings may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and corrected.
our dependence on technology, and the need to update frequently our technology infrastructure, exposes us to risks that also can result in losses.
our businesses depend on information technology infrastructure, both internal and external, to record and process, among other things, a large volume of increasingly complex transactions and other data, in many currencies, on a daily basis, across numerous and diverse markets and jurisdictions. due to our dependence on technology and the important role it plays in our business operations, combined with the increasing sophistication and frequency of potential cyber-attacks and other information security incidents, we must constantly improve and update our information technology infrastructure. upgrading, replacing, and modernizing these systems can require significant resources and often involves implementation, integration and security risks that could cause financial, reputational, and operational harm. in recent years, there has been an acceleration in the transition from traditional to digital financial services and heightened customer expectations in this area, and this transition may require us to invest greater resources in technological advancements. failure to ensure adequate review and consideration of critical business and regulatory issues prior to and during the introduction and deployment of key technological systems or networks or failure to align operational capabilities adequately with evolving client commitments and expectations may have a negative impact on our results of operations. the failure to respond properly to, and invest in, changes and advancements in technology and/or to compete for and retain employees with the necessary technical skills and expertise could limit our ability to attract and retain clients, prevent us from offering products and services comparable to those offered by our competitors, inhibit our ability to meet regulatory requirements or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our operations.
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation a failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system will be met. any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements, we could be required to implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports. in addition, there are risks that individuals, either employees or contractors, consciously circumvent established control mechanisms by, for example, exceeding trading or investment management limitations, or committing fraud.
failure of any of our third-party vendors (or their vendors) to perform can result in losses.
third-party vendors provide key components of our business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, and network access. our use of third-party vendors exposes us to the risk that such vendors (or their vendors) may not comply with their servicing and other contractual obligations, including with respect to indemnification and information security, and to the risk that we may not satisfy applicable regulatory responsibilities regarding the management and oversight of third parties and outsourcing providers. while we have established risk management processes and continuity plans, any disruptions in service from a key vendor for any reason or poor performance of services have in the past and could in the future have a negative effect on our ability to deliver products and services to our clients and conduct our business. replacing these third-party vendors or performing the tasks they perform for ourselves has in the past and could in the future create significant delay and expense.
we are subject to certain risks inherent in operating globally which may affect our business adversely.
in conducting our u.s. and non-u.s. business, we are subject to risks of loss and adverse economic impacts from various unfavorable political, economic, legal, public health, or other developments, including social or political instability, changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, unfavorable tax rate changes, tax court rulings and changes in laws and regulations. less mature and often less regulated business and investment environments heighten these risks in various emerging markets. our non-u.s. operations accounted for 32% of our revenue in 2023. our non-u.s. businesses are subject to extensive regulation by various non-u.s. regulators, including governments, securities exchanges, central banks and other regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate. in many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industry are uncertain and evolving and may be applied with extra scrutiny to foreign companies. moreover, the regulatory and supervisory standards and expectations in one jurisdiction may not conform with standards or expectations in other jurisdictions. even within a particular jurisdiction, the standards and expectations of multiple supervisory agencies exercising authority over our affairs may not be harmonized fully. accordingly, it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions. our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market and manage our relationships with regulators could have an adverse effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally. the failure to mitigate properly such risks or the failure of our operating infrastructure to support such international activities could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions, which could affect our business and results of operations adversely.
we actively strive to optimize our geographic footprint. this optimization may occur by establishing operations in lower-cost locations or by outsourcing to third-party vendors in various jurisdictions. these efforts expose us to the risk that we may not maintain service quality, control or effective management within these operations. in addition, we are exposed to the relevant macroeconomic, political, public health, and similar risks generally involved in doing business in those jurisdictions. the increased elements of risk that arise from conducting certain operating processes in some jurisdictions could lead to an increase in reputational risk. during periods of transition, greater operational risk and client concern exist with respect to maintaining a high level of service delivery.
in addition, we are subject in our global operations to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments, money laundering, and laws that prohibit us from doing business with certain individuals, groups and countries, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the usa patriot act, the uk bribery act, and economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the u.s. office of foreign assets control and similar agencies worldwide. while we have invested and continue to invest significant resources in training and in compliance monitoring, the geographic diversity of our operations, employees, clients and customers, as well as the vendors and other third parties with whom we deal, presents the risk that we may be found in violation of such rules, regulations, laws or programs and any such violation could subject us to significant penalties or affect our reputation adversely.
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation failure to control our costs and expenses adequately could affect our earnings negatively.
our success in controlling the costs and expenses of our business operations also impacts operating results. through various parts of our business strategy, we aim to produce efficiencies in operations that help reduce and control costs and expenses, including the costs of losses associated with operating risks attributable to servicing and managing financial assets. in recent years, increased expenses have affected-and a failure to control our costs and expenses in the future, whether as a result of inflation or otherwise, could affect-our earnings negatively.
pandemics, natural disasters, global climate change, acts of terrorism, geopolitical tensions, and global conflicts may have a negative impact on our business and operations.
pandemics, natural disasters, global climate change, acts of terrorism, geopolitical tensions, global conflicts (including the continuing military conflicts involving ukraine and the russian federation and israel and hamas) or other similar events, as well as government actions or other restrictions in connection with such events, have had in the past, or may in the future have, a negative impact on our business and operations. while we have in place business continuity plans, such events may still damage our facilities, disrupt or delay the normal operations of our business (including communications and technology), result in harm to or cause travel limitations on our employees, impose significant compliance costs with new financial and economic sanctions regimes, and have a similar impact on our clients, suppliers, third-party vendors and counterparties. for example, in some jurisdictions such as the russian federation, local market restrictions, laws, sanctions programs or government intervention inhibit our clients' and our ability to access or transfer cash or securities held for clients through subcustodians and clearing agencies. when such client deposit liabilities are on our consolidated balance sheet, we maintain a corresponding amount of cash on deposit with the subcustodian or clearing agency, which increases our credit exposure to that entity and can accumulate over time based upon distributions on, or other activities related to, our clients' assets. if the subcustodian or clearing agency were to become insolvent in circumstances not involving expropriation of assets or other sovereign risk events and/or factors or events beyond our reasonable control that excuse performance under force majeure or other contractual provisions, the risk of loss on such cash on deposit may potentially be incurred by us. as of december 31, 2023, we held cash that accumulates in relation to russian securities with our subcustodian and/or clearing agencies for the benefit of certain clients in our asset servicing business which are subject to restrictions that inhibit our ability to access or transfer such deposits, and which amount is expected to increase significantly over time as long as the sanctions and other relevant restrictions remain in effect. our subcustodian is also a subsidiary of a large, global financial institution with whom we have other credit exposures, which may limit the financial relationship we may have with this counterparty and has in the past made, and may in the future make, compliance with specific u.s. regulatory single counterparty credit limits more challenging.
the foregoing or similar events also could impact us negatively to the extent that they result in reduced capital markets activity, lower asset price levels, or disruptions in general economic activity in the u.s. or abroad, or in financial market settlement functions. in addition, these or similar events may impact economic growth negatively, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations, and may have other adverse effects on us in ways that we are unable to predict. please see "strategic risks" in this "risk factors" section for further description of risks associated with climate change.
credit risks failure to evaluate accurately the prospects for repayment when we extend credit or maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses can result in losses or the need to make additional provisions for credit losses, both of which reduce our earnings.
we evaluate extensions of credit before we make them and provide for credit risks based on our assessment of the credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio, including undrawn credit commitments. this process requires us to make difficult and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions through the life of these credit exposures. challenges associated with our credit risk assessments include identifying the proper factors to be used in assessments and accurately estimating the impacts of those factors. allowances that prove to be inadequate may require us to realize increased provisions for credit losses or write down the value of certain assets on our balance sheet, which result in losses and/or increased provisions for credit losses and in turn would affect earnings negatively.
market volatility and/or weak economic conditions can result in losses or the need for additional provisions for credit losses, both of which reduce our earnings.
credit risk levels and our earnings can be affected by market volatility and/or weakness in the economy in general and in the particular locales in which we extend credit, a deterioration in credit quality, or a reduced demand for credit. adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our borrowers resulting from market volatility, elevated interest rates, and/or weakened economic conditions could impact the borrowers' abilities to repay outstanding loans, which could in turn impact our financial condition and results of operations negatively.
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation the failure or perceived weakness of any of our significant counterparties could expose us to loss.
the financial markets are characterized by extensive interconnections among financial institutions, including banks, broker-dealers, collective investment funds and insurance companies. as a result of these interconnections, we and many of our clients have counterparty exposure to other financial institutions. this counterparty exposure presents risks to us and to our clients because the failure or perceived weakness of any of our counterparties has the potential to expose us to risk of loss. instability in the financial markets, or in certain countries where these counterparties are domiciled, has resulted historically in some financial institutions becoming less creditworthy. during such periods of instability, we are exposed to increased counterparty risks, both as principal and in our capacity as agent for our clients. changes in market perception of the financial strength of particular financial institutions can occur rapidly, are often based upon a variety of factors and can be difficult to predict. in addition, the criteria for and manner of governmental support of financial institutions and other economically important sectors remain uncertain. further, the consolidation of financial services firms and the failures of other financial institutions has in the past increased, and may in the future increase, the concentration of our counterparty risk. these risks are heightened by the fact that our operating model relies on the use of unaffiliated sub-custodians to a greater degree than certain of our competitors that have banking operations in more jurisdictions than we do. we are not able to mitigate all of our and our clients' counterparty credit risk. if a significant individual counterparty defaults on an obligation to us, we could incur financial losses that have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
liquidity risks if we do not manage our liquidity effectively, our business could suffer.
liquidity is essential for the operation of our business. market conditions, unforeseen outflows of funds or other events could have a negative effect on our level or cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund new business transactions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. if our access to stable and low-cost sources of funding, such as customer deposits, is reduced, we may need to use alternative funding, which could be more expensive or of limited availability. further evolution in the regulatory requirements relating to liquidity and risk management also may impact us negatively. additional regulations may impose more stringent liquidity requirements for large financial institutions, including the corporation and the bank. given the overlap and complex interactions of these regulations with other regulatory changes, the full impact of the adopted and proposed regulations remains uncertain until their full implementation.
in addition, a significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large, complex clients, which, by their nature, require substantial liquidity. our failure to manage successfully the liquidity and balance sheet issues attendant to this portion of our business may have a negative impact on our ability to meet client needs and grow.
we also manage investment products that, while not obligations of ours, may be exposed to liquidity risks. these products, such as money market and other short-term investments provide clients a right to the return of cash or assets on limited notice. if clients demand a return of their cash or assets, particularly on limited notice, and these investment products do not have the liquidity to support those demands, we could be forced to sell investment securities held by these investment products at unfavorable prices potentially damaging our reputation with the investment community.
for more information on regulations and other regulatory changes relating to liquidity, see "supervision and regulation-liquidity standards" in item 1, "business." any substantial, unexpected or prolonged changes in the level or cost of liquidity could affect our business adversely.
if the bank is unable to supply the corporation with funds over time, the corporation could be unable to meet its various obligations.
the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank and the corporation's other subsidiaries. the corporation relies in large part on dividends paid to it by the bank to meet its obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders of the corporation. there are various legal limitations on the extent to which the bank and the corporation's other subsidiaries can supply funds to the corporation by dividend or otherwise. dividend payments by the bank to the corporation in the future will require continued generation of earnings by the bank and could require regulatory approval under certain circumstances. for more information on dividend restrictions, see "supervision and regulation-payment of dividends" in item 1, "business."
we may need to raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms.
we may need to raise additional capital to provide sufficient resources to meet our business needs and commitments, to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients, to maintain our credit ratings in response to regulatory changes, including capital rules, or for other purposes. however, our ability to access the capital markets, if needed, will depend on a number of factors, including the state of the financial markets. rising interest rates, disruptions in financial markets, negative perceptions of our business or our financial strength, or other factors may impact our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, on terms acceptable to us. for example, in the event of future turmoil in the banking
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation industry or other idiosyncratic events, there is no guarantee that the u.s. government will invoke the systemic risk exception, create additional liquidity programs, or take any other action to stabilize the banking industry or provide liquidity. any diminished ability to access short-term funding or capital markets to raise additional capital, if needed, could subject us to liability, restrict our ability to grow, require us to take actions that would affect our earnings negatively or otherwise affect our business and our ability to implement our business plan, capital plan and strategic goals adversely.
any downgrades in our credit ratings, or an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength, could affect our borrowing costs, capital costs and liquidity adversely.
rating agencies publish credit ratings and outlooks on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities. our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies and thus may change from time to time based on the agencies' evaluation of a number of factors, including our financial strength, performance, prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control, such as rating-agency-specific criteria or frameworks for our industry or certain security types, which are subject to revision from time to time, and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally.
downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our borrowing costs, our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity adversely. a failure to maintain an acceptable credit rating also may preclude us from being competitive in certain products. additionally, our counterparties, as well as our clients, rely on our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us. if we experience diminished financial strength or stability, actual or perceived, a decline in our stock price or a reduced credit rating, our counterparties may be less willing to enter into transactions, secured or unsecured, with us, our clients may reduce or place limits on the level of services we provide them or seek other service providers, or our prospective clients may select other service providers, all of which may have other adverse effects on our business.
the risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy relative to other market participants is higher in a market environment in which the consolidation, and in some instances failure, of financial institutions, including major global financial institutions, could result in a smaller number of larger counterparties and competitors. if our counterparties perceive us to be a less viable counterparty, our ability to enter into financial transactions on terms acceptable to us or our clients, on our or our clients' behalf, will be compromised materially. if our clients reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services we provide to them, our revenues will decrease accordingly.
regulatory and legal risks failure to comply with regulations and/or supervisory expectations can result in penalties and regulatory constraints that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our business, or that reduce earnings.
virtually every aspect of our business around the world is regulated, generally by domestic and foreign governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions. these regulations cover a variety of matters, including prohibited activities, required capital levels, resolution planning, human trafficking and modern slavery, and data privacy and security. some of these requirements are directed specifically at protecting depositors of the bank, the u.s. dif and the banking system as a whole, not our stockholders or other security holders. regulatory violations or the failure to meet formal or informal commitments made to regulators could generate penalties, require corrective actions that increase costs of conducting business, result in limitations on our ability to conduct business, restrict our ability to expand or impact our reputation adversely. failure to obtain necessary approvals from regulatory agencies, whether formal or based upon supervisory expectations, on a timely basis could affect proposed business opportunities and results of operations adversely. similarly, changes in laws or failure to comply with new requirements or with future changes in laws or regulations may impact our results of operations and financial condition negatively.
we are subject to extensive and evolving government regulation and supervision that impacts our operations. changes by the u.s. and other governments to laws, regulations and policies applicable to the financial services industry may heighten the challenges we face and make regulatory compliance more difficult and costly.
we operate in a highly regulated environment, and are subject to a comprehensive statutory and regulatory regime affecting all aspects of our business and operations, including oversight by governmental agencies both inside and outside the u.s. various regulatory bodies have demonstrated heightened scrutiny of financial institutions through many regulatory initiatives. these initiatives have increased compliance costs and regulatory risks and may lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a compliance violation, even if the failure to comply was inadvertent or reflects a difference in interpretation. we have programs in place, including policies, training and various forms of monitoring, designed to ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements. we cannot provide assurance that these programs and policies are or will be adequate to identify and manage internal and external compliance risks. for example, our business may be adversely impacted by actual or alleged misconduct by an employee or other negative outcomes caused by human error. changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory and supervisory policies or their interpretation or implementation and the continued heightening of regulatory and supervisory requirements could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways.
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation additionally, governments and regulators may take actions that increase intervention in the normal operation of our businesses and the businesses of our competitors in the financial services industry, and these likely would involve additional legislative and regulatory requirements imposed on banks and other financial services companies. any such actions could increase compliance costs and regulatory risks, lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation, affect our ability to compete successfully, and also may impact the nature and level of competition in the industry in unpredictable ways. the full scope and impact of possible legislative or regulatory changes and the extent of regulatory activity is uncertain and difficult to predict. for example, we are unable to predict what, if any, changes to financial services laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industry may be enacted by the u.s. congress and what the impact of any such changes will be upon our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
the evolving regulatory and supervisory environment and uncertainty about the timing and scope of future laws, regulations and policies may contribute to decisions we may make to suspend, reduce or withdraw from existing businesses, activities or initiatives, which may result in potential lost revenue or significant restructuring or related costs or exposures. we also face the risk of becoming subject to new or more stringent requirements in connection with the introduction of new regulations or modification of existing regulations, which could require us to hold more capital or liquidity or have other adverse effects on our businesses or profitability. for example, proposed changes to applicable capital and liquidity requirements, such as the basel iii endgame proposal and the long-term debt proposal, could result in increased expenses or cost of funding, which could negatively affect our financial results or our ability to pay dividends and engage in share repurchases. for more information concerning our legal and regulatory obligations with respect to basel iii and long-term debt requirements, see "supervision and regulation" in item 1, "business."
in addition, regulatory responses in connection with severe market downturns or unforeseen stress events may alter or disrupt our planned future strategies and actions. adverse developments affecting the overall strength and soundness of other financial institutions, the financial services industry as a whole and the general economic climate and the u.s. treasury market could have a negative impact on perceptions about the strength and soundness of our business even if we are not subject to the same adverse developments. for example, during 2023, the fdic took control and was appointed receiver of silicon valley bank, signature bank, and first republic bank. the failure of other banks and financial institutions and the measures taken by governments and regulators in response to these events could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we are subject to complex and evolving laws, regulations, rules, standards and contractual obligations regarding data privacy and security, which could increase the cost of doing business, compliance risks and potential liability.
we are subject to complex and evolving laws, regulations, rules, standards and contractual obligations governing data privacy and security, which may differ and potentially conflict, in various jurisdictions, and any failure to comply with these laws, regulations, rules, standards and contractual obligations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage. regulators globally are introducing the potential for greater monetary fines on institutions that suffer from breaches leading to the loss, misappropriation or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal, confidential, proprietary or sensitive information. most u.s. states, the eu and other non-u.s. jurisdictions also have adopted their own statutes and/or regulations concerning data privacy and security and notification of data breaches. these and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of personal and other types of information could greatly increase compliance costs, the size of potential fines related to the protection of such information and reporting obligations in the case of cyber-attacks or other information security incidents. compliance with these laws, regulations, rules and standards may require us to change and continuously update our policies, procedures and technology controls for information security, which could, among other things, make us more vulnerable to operational failures and to monetary penalties for breach of such laws, regulations, rules and standards.
in the u.s., there are numerous federal, state and local data privacy and security laws and regulations governing the collection, sharing, use, retention, disclosure, security, storage, transfer and other processing of personal information. at the federal level, we are subject to, among other laws and regulations, the rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission and the gramm-leach-bliley act. moreover, the u.s. congress has recently considered, and is currently considering, various proposals for more comprehensive data privacy and security legislation, to which we may be subject if enacted. at the state level, we are subject to laws and regulations such as the ccpa. numerous other states also have enacted, or are in the process of enacting or considering, comprehensive state-level data privacy and security laws and regulations that share similarities with the ccpa. moreover, laws in all 50 u.s. states require businesses to provide notice under certain circumstances to consumers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach.
at the international level, we are subject to the gdpr and uk gdpr and similar laws are in effect or being considered in other jurisdictions in which we operate across the globe. while the gdpr and the uk gdpr remain substantially similar for the time being, the uk government has announced that it would seek to chart its own path on data protection and reform its relevant laws, including in ways that may differ from the gdpr, to an extent. legal developments in the eea and the uk also have created complexity and uncertainty regarding processing and transfers of
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation personal data from the eea and the uk to the u.s. and other so-called third countries outside the eea and the uk that have not been determined by the relevant data protection authorities to provide an adequate level of protection for privacy rights. importantly, significant monetary fines have been imposed since the introduction of such stringent privacy laws in the eu and the uk and regulatory expectations on governance and accountability in the protection of privacy and data continue to increase.
further, while we strive to publish and prominently display privacy notices and policies that are accurate, comprehensive, and compliant with applicable laws, regulations, rules and industry standards, we cannot ensure that our privacy policies and other statements regarding our practices will be considered sufficient to protect us from claims, proceedings, liability or adverse publicity relating to data privacy and security, considering the fast-evolving regulatory expectations. although we endeavor to comply with our privacy policies, we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. the publication of our privacy policies and other documentation that provide promises and assurances about data privacy and security can subject us to potential government or legal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices. any concerns about our data privacy and security practices, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business.
any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, or applicable data privacy and security laws, regulations, rules, standards or contractual obligations, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or unauthorized loss, destruction, use, modification, acquisition, disclosure, release or transfer of personal information, may result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, the expenditure of substantial costs, time and other resources, proceedings or actions against us, legal liability, governmental investigations, enforcement actions, claims, fines, judgments, awards, penalties, sanctions and costly litigation (including class actions). any of the foregoing could harm our reputation, distract our management and technical personnel, increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the demand for our products and services, and ultimately result in the imposition of liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we may be impacted adversely by claims or litigation, including claims or litigation relating to our fiduciary responsibilities.
our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us, claiming that we or third parties for whom they say we are responsible have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty perceived to be owed to them. our trust, custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk. this risk is heightened when we act as a fiduciary for our clients and may be further heightened during periods when credit, equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile, or when clients or investors are experiencing losses. in addition, regulators, tax authorities and courts have increasingly sought to hold financial institutions liable for the misconduct of their clients where such regulators and courts have determined that the financial institution should have detected that the client was engaged in wrongdoing, even though the financial institution had no direct knowledge of the wrongdoing.
claims made or actions brought against us, whether founded or unfounded, may result in lawsuits, injunctions, settlements, damages, fines or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or require changes to our business. even if we defend ourselves successfully, the cost of litigation is often substantial, and public reports regarding claims made against us may cause damage to our reputation among existing and prospective clients or negatively impact the confidence of counterparties, rating agencies and stockholders, consequently affecting our earnings negatively.
we may be impacted adversely by supervisory and/or regulatory enforcement matters.
in the ordinary course of our business, we are subject to various governmental enforcement inquiries, supervisory examinations, investigations and subpoenas. these may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be directed specifically at us. in conjunction with both supervisory and enforcement matters, we may face limits on our ability to conduct or expand our business, be required to implement corrective actions that increase the costs of conducting business, or become subject to civil or criminal penalties or other remedial sanctions, any of which could result in reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse impact on us.
the complexity of the federal and state regulatory, supervisory and enforcement regimes in the u.s., coupled with the global scope of our operations and the increased aggressiveness of the tax and regulatory environment worldwide, also means that a single event may give risk to a large number of overlapping investigations and regulatory proceedings, either by multiple agencies in the u.s. or by multiple regulators and other governmental entities or tax authorities in different jurisdictions. responding to inquiries, investigations, and proceedings, regardless of the outcome of the matter, is time consuming and expensive and can divert the attention of our senior management from our business. the outcome of such proceedings may be difficult to predict or estimate until late in the proceedings, which may last a number of years.
the number of regulatory and governmental investigations and proceedings, as well as the amount of penalties and fines sought, has remained elevated for many firms in the financial services industry. the corporation and other financial
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation institutions have become subject to increased scrutiny, more intense supervision and regulation, and a higher risk of enforcement action, which we expect to continue. any such heightened enforcement activity or new regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we may fail to set aside adequate reserves for, or otherwise underestimate our liability relating to, pending and threatened claims, with a negative effect on our earnings.
we estimate our potential liability for pending and threatened claims and record reserves when appropriate pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). the process is inherently subject to risk, including the risks that a judge or jury could decide a case contrary to our evaluation of the law or the facts or that a court could change or modify existing law on a particular issue important to the case. our earnings will be adversely affected if our reserves are not adequate.
the ultimate impact on us of regulatory divergence between the united kingdom and the european union remains uncertain.
while regulatory standards remain largely aligned following the uk's withdrawal from the eu, commonly referred to as "brexit," it is possible that future divergence may occur between the uk and eu; therefore, the final impact remains uncertain. in december 2020, the uk and the eu agreed on a trade and cooperation agreement that entered into force on may 1, 2021. while the trade and cooperation agreement covers the general objectives and framework of the relationship between the uk and the eu, it generally does not address the regulation of financial services. instead, in march 2021, the uk and the eu agreed upon a framework for voluntary regulatory cooperation and dialogue on financial services issues between the parties in a memorandum of understanding, which was signed on june 27, 2023.
since the uk's withdrawal from the eu on december 31, 2020, the uk government has embarked on a program of significant regulatory reform. in particular, the recently enacted financial services and markets act 2023 contains provisions that will eventually repeal all eu rules and regulations relating to financial services that were incorporated into uk law following brexit. the uk government and the uk financial services regulatory authorities has been consulting on a number of measures that will replace the current eu-based rules and regulations with measures that reflect the particular needs of the uk market and policy objectives of the uk's regulatory authorities. consequently, over time it is likely that the rules and regulations relating to financial services will diverge, which may result in additional compliance costs for our uk and eu businesses.
if we fail to comply with legal standards, we could incur liability to our clients or lose clients, which could affect our earnings negatively.
managing or servicing assets with reasonable prudence in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is an important part of our business. failure to comply with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws, manage adequately the risks or manage appropriately the differing interests often involved in the exercise of fiduciary responsibilities may subject us to liability or cause client dissatisfaction, which may impact negatively our earnings and growth.
strategic risks if we are not able to attract, retain and motivate personnel, our business could be negatively affected.
our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract new employees, retain and motivate our existing employees, and continue to compensate our employees competitively. competition for the best employees in most activities in which we engage can be intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain necessary personnel. factors that affect our ability to attract and retain talented and diverse employees include our compensation and benefits programs, our profitability and our reputation for rewarding and promoting qualified employees. our ability to attract and retain key executives and other employees may be hindered as a result of existing and potential regulations applicable to incentive compensation and other aspects of our compensation programs. these laws and regulations may not apply in the same manner to all financial institutions and other companies, which therefore may subject us to more restrictions than other institutions and companies with which we compete for talent and may also hinder our ability to compete for talent with other industries. in addition, our current or future approach to in-office and remote work arrangements may not meet the needs or expectations of our current or prospective employees, may not be perceived as favorable as compared to the arrangements offered by competitors and may not be conducive to a collaborative working environment, which could adversely affect our ability to attract, retain and motivate employees. the unexpected loss of services of necessary personnel, both in businesses and corporate functions, could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills; knowledge of our markets, operations and clients; years of industry experience; and, in some cases, the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. similarly, the loss of necessary employees, either individually or as a group, could affect our clients' perception of our abilities adversely. a competitive labor market may also have the effect of heightening many of these risks.
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation if we do not develop and execute strategic plans successfully, our growth may be impacted negatively.
our growth depends upon successful, consistent development and execution of our business strategies. a failure to develop and execute these strategies may impact growth negatively. a failure to grow organically or to integrate successfully an acquisition could have an adverse effect on our business. the challenges arising from the integration of an acquired business may include preserving valuable relationships with employees, clients, suppliers and other business partners, delivering enhanced products and services, as well as combining accounting, data processing and internal control systems. to the extent we enter into transactions to acquire complementary businesses and/or technologies, we may not achieve the expected benefits of such transactions, which could result in increased costs, lowered revenues, ineffective deployment of capital, regulatory concerns, exit costs or diminished competitive position or reputation. these risks may be increased if the acquired company operates internationally or in a geographic location where we do not already have significant business operations.
execution of our business strategies also may require certain regulatory approvals or consents, which may include approvals of the federal reserve board and other domestic and non-u.s. regulatory authorities. these regulatory authorities have the ability to impose conditions on the activities or transactions contemplated by our business strategies which may impact negatively our ability to realize fully the expected benefits of certain opportunities. further, acquisitions we announce may not be completed, or completed in the time frame anticipated, if we do not receive the required regulatory approvals, if regulatory approvals are significantly delayed or if other closing conditions are not satisfied.
we are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our businesses, which could have a negative effect on our ability to maintain satisfactory prices and grow our earnings.
we provide a broad range of financial products and services in highly competitive markets. we compete against large, well-capitalized, and geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices. in certain businesses, such as foreign exchange trading, electronic networks present a competitive challenge. additionally, technological advances and the growth of internet-based commerce have made it possible for other types of institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business. many of these nontraditional service providers have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures. the same may be said for competitors based in non-u.s. jurisdictions, where legal and regulatory environments may be more favorable than those applicable to the corporation and the bank as u.s.-domiciled financial institutions. these competitive pressures may have a negative effect on our earnings and ability to grow. pricing pressures, as a result of the willingness of competitors to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price, also may result in a reduction in the price we can charge for our products and services, which could have, and in some cases has had, a negative effect on our ability to maintain or increase our profitability.
damage to our reputation could have a direct and negative effect on our ability to compete, grow and generate revenue.
our ability to compete effectively, to attract and retain clients and employees, and to grow our business is dependent on maintaining our reputation. damage to our reputation can therefore cause significant harm to our business and prospects, and can arise from various sources, including, among others, the failure or perceived failure to meet or appropriately address client expectations or fiduciary or other obligations; operational failures; legal and regulatory requirements; potential conflicts of interest; data privacy and security; social and sustainability concerns related to our business activities; or any other of the risks discussed in this item 1a. additionally, the actual or alleged actions of our affiliates, vendors or other third parties with which we do business, the actual or alleged actions or statements of our employees or adverse publicity could negatively impact our reputation and significantly harm our business prospects. damage to our reputation for delivery of a high level of service could undermine the confidence of clients and prospects in our ability to serve them and accordingly affect our earnings negatively. damage to our reputation also could affect the confidence of rating agencies, regulators, stockholders and other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business and the performance of our common stock. failure to maintain our reputation ultimately could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our balance sheet or grow our business. actions by the financial services industry generally or by other members of or individuals in the financial services industry also could impact our reputation negatively or lead to a general loss of confidence in, or impact market perception of, financial institutions that could negatively affect us.
our reputation may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding the corporation and the bank, whether true or not, that may be published or broadcast by the media or posted on social media, non-mainstream news services or other parts of the internet. the proliferation of social media channels utilized by us and third parties, as well as the personal use of social media by our employees and others, may increase the risk of negative publicity, including through the rapid dissemination of inaccurate, misleading or false information, which could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences. furthermore, esg-related issues have been the subject of increased focus by regulators and stakeholders, including outside the u.s., and particularly in europe. any inability to meet applicable requirements or expectations, including those from conflicting u.s. and non-u.s. global expectations, may adversely
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation impact our reputation. additionally, various stakeholders have divergent views on esg-related matters, including in the countries in which we operate and invest, as well as states and localities where we serve public sector clients. in the case of proxy voting, there is the inherent risk of misalignment between the proxy votes we cast on behalf of clients and all of our clients' values and preferences. this divergence increases the risk that any action or lack thereof by us on such matters will be perceived negatively by some stakeholders and could adversely impact our reputation and business.
we need to invest in innovation constantly, and the inability or failure to do so may affect our businesses and earnings negatively.
our success in the competitive environment in which we operate requires consistent investment of capital and human resources in innovation, particularly in light of the current "fintech" environment, in which the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes and financial institutions are investing significantly in evaluating new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies, and developing potentially industry-changing new products, services and industry standards. our investment is directed at generating new products and services, and adapting existing products and services to the evolving standards and demands of the marketplace. among other things, investing in innovation helps us maintain a mix of products and services that keeps pace with our competitors and achieve acceptable margins. our investment also focuses on enhancing the delivery of our products and services in order to compete successfully for new clients or gain additional business from existing clients. effectively identifying gaps or weaknesses in our product offerings is important to our success. failure to keep pace with our competition in any of these areas could affect our business opportunities, growth and earnings adversely. there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with innovation efforts, including an increased risk that new and emerging technologies may expose us to increased data privacy and security and other information technology threats. we must invest significant time and resources in developing and marketing new products and services, and expected timetables for the introduction and development of new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not be met. further, our revenues and costs may fluctuate because new products and services generally require start-up costs while corresponding revenues take time to develop or may not develop at all.
failure to understand or appreciate fully the risks associated with development or delivery of new product and service offerings may affect our businesses and earnings negatively.
the success of our innovation efforts depends, in part, on the successful implementation of new product and service initiatives. not only must we keep pace with competitors in the development of these new offerings, but we must accurately price them (as well as existing products) on a risk-adjusted basis and deliver them to clients effectively. our identification of risks arising from new products and services, both in their design and implementation, and effective responses to those identified risks, including pricing, is key to the success of our efforts at innovation and investment in new product and service offerings.
our success with large, complex clients requires an understanding of the market and legal, regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions.
a significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large, complex clients which requires an understanding of the market and legal, regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions. any failure to understand, address or comply with those standards appropriately could affect our growth prospects or affect our reputation negatively. we identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls. if we fail to identify and manage significant risks successfully, we could incur financial loss, suffer damage to our reputation that could restrict our ability to grow or conduct business profitably, or become subject to regulatory penalties or constraints that could limit some of our activities or make them significantly more expensive. in addition, our businesses and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving. we may fail to understand fully the implications of changes in legal or regulatory requirements, our businesses or the financial markets or fail to enhance our risk framework to address those changes in a timely fashion. if our risk framework is ineffective, either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets, legal and regulatory requirements, our businesses, our counterparties, clients or service providers or for other reasons, we could incur losses, suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory or contractual mandates or expectations. these risks are magnified as client requirements become more complex and as our increasingly global business requires end-to-end management of operational and other processes across multiple time zones and many inter-related products and services.
we may take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings.
we may take action or incur expenses in order to maintain client satisfaction or preserve the usefulness of investments or investment vehicles we manage in light of changes in security ratings, liquidity or valuation issues or other developments, even though we are not required to do so by law or the terms of governing instruments. the risk that we will decide to take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings is greater in periods when credit or equity markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile and liquidity in markets is disrupted.
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation our operations, businesses and clients could be materially adversely affected by the effects of climate change or concerns related thereto.
risks related to climate change may impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations adversely. the physical risks of climate change include rising average global temperatures, rising sea levels, and an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters. such developments could disrupt our operations and resilience capabilities, those of our clients, or third parties on which we rely. further, the consequences of climate change could negatively impact our clients' ability to pay outstanding loans, reduce the value of collateral, or result in insurance shortfalls.
climate change could also result in transition risk arising from changes in policy, regulations, technology, business practices or market preferences toward a lower-carbon economy which could adversely impact us or our clients. these impacts could result in increased operational or compliance costs, higher energy expenses, additional taxes, and the devaluation of assets.
our reputation and business prospects may also be damaged if we do not, or are perceived not to, effectively prepare for the potential business and operational opportunities and risks associated with climate change, including through the development and marketing of effective and competitive new products and services designed to address our clients' climate risk-related needs. we also face regulatory and liability risk associated with greenwashing claims, a failure to execute on our public climate-related commitments, or by association with individuals, entities, industries or products that may be inconsistent with our stated positions on climate change issues. at the same time, certain financial institutions have also been subject to significant scrutiny by regulatory agencies and government officials and other criticism and negative publicity as a result of their decisions to reduce their involvement in certain industries or projects perceived to be associated with climate change. if we do not identify, quantify, and mitigate such risks successfully, we may experience financial losses, litigation, reputational harm, and losses of investor and stakeholder confidence.
even as regulators begin to mandate additional disclosure of climate-related information by companies across sectors, methodologies and data used to conduct more robust climate-related risk analyses are still in development. third‐party exposures, emissions, climate-related risks, and other data are limited in availability and variable in quality. modeling capabilities across the industry to analyze climate-related risks and interconnections are improving but remain imperfect. these legislative and regulatory uncertainties along with inconsistencies and conflicts of policy across jurisdictions, and changes regarding climate-related risk management and disclosures are likely to result in higher regulatory, compliance, credit, reputational and other risks and costs.
other risks the systems and models we employ to analyze, monitor and mitigate risks, as well as for other business purposes, are inherently limited, may not be effective in all cases and, in any case, cannot eliminate all risks that we face.
we use various systems and models in analyzing and monitoring several risk categories, as well as for other business purposes. while we assess and improve these systems and models on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that they, along with other related controls, will effectively mitigate risk under all circumstances, or that they will adequately mitigate any risk or loss to us. as with any systems and models, there are inherent limitations because they involve techniques and judgments that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which we operate, nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes. further, these systems and models may fail to quantify accurately the magnitude of the risks we face or they may not be effective against all types of risk, including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated. our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions and historical analyses and correlations. these assumptions may be incorrect, and the historical correlations on which we rely may not continue to be relevant. models based on historical data sets might not be accurate predicators of future outcomes and their ability to appropriately predict future outcomes may degrade over time due to limited historical patterns, extreme or unanticipated market movements or customer behavior and liquidity, especially during severe market downturns or stress events (e.g., geopolitical or pandemic events). consequently, the measurements that we make may not adequately capture or express the true risk profiles of our businesses or provide accurate data for other business purposes, each of which ultimately could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. errors in the underlying model or model assumptions, or inadequate model assumptions, could result in unanticipated and adverse consequences, including material loss or noncompliance with regulatory requirements or expectations.
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation changes in tax laws and interpretations and challenges to our tax positions may affect our earnings negatively.
both u.s. and non-u.s. governments and tax authorities, including states and municipalities, from time to time issue new, or modify existing, tax laws and regulations. these authorities may also issue new, or modify existing, interpretations of those laws and regulations. these new laws, regulations or interpretations, and our actions taken in response to, or reliance upon, such changes in the tax laws may impact our tax position in a manner that affects our earnings negatively.
in the course of our business, we are sometimes subject to challenges from u.s. and non-u.s. tax authorities, including states and municipalities, regarding the amount of taxes due. these challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income, deductions, tax credits, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions, all of which may require a greater provision for taxes or otherwise affect earnings negatively.
changes in accounting standards may be difficult to predict and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
new accounting standards, changes to existing accounting standards, or changes in the interpretation of existing accounting standards by the financial accounting standards board, the sec or bank regulatory agencies, or otherwise reflected in gaap, potentially could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. these changes are difficult to predict and in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the revised treatment of certain transactions or activities, or even the restatement of consolidated financial statements for prior periods.
our ability to return capital to stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by u.s. banking laws and regulations, applicable provisions of delaware law, or our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock and the terms of our outstanding debt.
holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends and other distributions of capital as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments under delaware law. although we have declared cash dividends on shares of our common stock historically, we are not required to do so. in addition to the approval of our board of directors, our ability to take certain actions, including our ability to pay dividends, repurchase stock, and make other capital distributions, is dependent upon, among other things, their payment being made in accordance with the capital plan rules and capital adequacy standards of the federal reserve board.
a significant source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank. as a result, our ability to pay dividends on the corporation's common stock will depend in large part on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation. there are various legal limitations on the extent to which the bank and the corporation's other subsidiaries can supply funds to the corporation by dividend or otherwise. dividend payments by the bank to the corporation in the future will require continued generation of earnings by the bank and could require regulatory approval under certain circumstances. if the bank is unable to pay dividends to the corporation in the future, our ability to pay dividends on the corporation's common stock would be affected adversely.
our ability to declare or pay dividends on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our common stock or any of our shares that rank junior to our preferred stock as to the payment of dividends and/or the distribution of any assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the corporation also generally will be prohibited in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends on our series d non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock (series d preferred stock) and series e non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock (series e preferred stock). further, in the future if we default on certain of our outstanding debt we will be prohibited from making dividend payments on our common stock until such payments have been brought current.
any reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend, or even our failure to maintain the common stock dividend level in a manner comparable to our competitors, likely would have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. for more information on dividend restrictions, see "supervision and regulation-payment of dividends" and "supervision and regulation-capital planning and stress testing" in item 1, "business."
additionally, on october 19, 2021, we announced that our board authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to 25.0 million shares of the corporation's outstanding common stock. the corporation retains the ability to repurchase when circumstances warrant and applicable regulation permits. the inflation reduction act of 2022, imposes a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchases after december 31, 2022. there have been recent proposals to significantly increase this excise tax rate. any such material increases may impact our future strategies relating to the return of capital to our shareholders, including the size of, or execution against, current or future repurchase programs related to shares of our common stock.

revenue northern trust generates the majority of its revenue from noninterest income that primarily consists of trust, investment and other servicing fees. net interest income comprises the remainder of revenue and consists of interest income generated by earning assets, net of interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds.
revenue in 2023 of $6.77 billion increased $12.3 million from $6.76 billion in 2022. noninterest income represented 71% and 72% of total revenue in 2023 and 2022, respectively, and totaled $4.79 billion in 2023, which decreased $82.5 million, or 2%, from $4.87 billion in 2022.
noninterest income in 2023 decreased primarily due to lower foreign exchange trading income and lower trust, investment and other servicing fees, partially offset by lower investment securities losses compared to the prior year and higher other operating income. investment security gains (losses), net reflected $169.5 million of losses in 2023 as compared to $214.0 million of losses in 2022. both losses in investment security gains (losses), net in 2023 and 2022 were due to a repositioning of the available for sale debt securities portfolio. other operating income of $228.7 million in 2023 increased $37.4 million, or 19%, from $191.3 million in the prior year, primarily due to higher income associated with a market value increase in supplemental compensation plans and higher banking and credit-related services fees. trust, investment and other servicing fees of $4.36 billion in 2023 decreased $70.8 million, or 2%, from $4.43 billion in 2022, primarily due to net asset outflows and unfavorable markets, partially offset by lower money market fee waivers and favorable currency translation.
net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (fte) basis in 2023 of $2.04 billion increased $106.7 million, or 6%, from $1.93 billion in 2022, primarily due to higher average interest rates, partially offset by an unfavorable balance sheet mix. the net interest margin on an fte basis increased to 1.56% in 2023 from 1.39% in 2022, primarily due to higher average interest rates, partially offset by an unfavorable funding mix shift. average earning assets decreased $8.0 billion, or 6%, from $138.8 billion in 2022 to $130.8 billion in 2023, primarily due to lower client deposits, partially offset by higher borrowing activity, the net of which resulted in lower funding of earning assets.

asset servicing asset servicing trust, investment and other servicing fees are primarily attributable to services related to custody, fund administration, investment management, and securities lending. custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of asset servicing fees, are driven primarily by values of client auc/a, transaction volumes and the number of accounts. the asset values used to calculate these fees vary depending on the individual fee arrangements negotiated with each client. custody fees related to asset values are client specific and are priced based on month-end market values, quarter-end market values, or the average of month-end market values for the quarter. the fund administration fees that are asset-value-related are priced using month-end, quarter-end, or average daily balances. investment management fees are based generally on market values of client aum management throughout the period. typically, the asset values used to calculate fee revenue are based on a one-month or one-quarter lag.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations securities lending revenue is affected by market values; the demand for securities to be lent, which drives volumes; and the interest rate spread earned on the investment of cash deposited by investment firms as collateral for securities they have borrowed. the other fee category in asset servicing includes such products as investment risk and analytical services, benefit payments, and other services. revenue from these products is based generally on the volume of services provided or a fixed fee.
custody and fund administration fees decreased in 2023 from 2022 primarily due to unfavorable lagged markets. investment management fees in 2023 decreased from 2022 primarily due to asset outflows, partially offset by lower money market fund fee waivers.

foreign exchange trading income northern trust provides foreign exchange services in the normal course of business as an integral part of its global custody services. active management of currency positions, within conservative limits, also contributes to foreign exchange trading income. foreign exchange trading income in 2023 decreased from 2022, primarily driven by lower volatility, a decline in client volumes, and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange swap activity in treasury.
treasury management fees treasury management fees, generated from cash and treasury management products and services provided to clients, in 2023 decreased from 2022, primarily due to an increase in the earnings credit rate applied to client balances.
security commissions and trading income security commissions and trading income, generated primarily from securities brokerage services provided by northern trust securities, inc., in 2023 decreased from 2022, primarily driven by lower equity commissions from lower equity trading volumes.
other operating income other operating income in 2023 increased from 2022 primarily due to higher income associated with a market value increase in supplemental compensation plans and higher banking and credit-related services fees.
please refer to note 18, "other operating income" included under item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data," for additional details related to other operating income.
investment security gains (losses), net investment security gains (losses), net reflects a $176.4 million available for sale debt security loss arising from a repositioning of the portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2023 and a $6.9 million gain upon sale of certain available for sale debt securities in the first quarter of 2023. in the prior year, there was a $213.0 million loss related to an intent to sell available for sale debt securities also arising from a repositioning of the portfolio.
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations net interest income net interest income is defined as the total of interest income and amortized fees on earning assets, less interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds, adjusted for the impact of interest-related hedging activity. earning assets-including federal funds sold, securities purchased under agreements to resell, interest-bearing due from and deposits with banks, federal reserve and other central bank deposits, securities, loans and leases, and other interest-earning assets-are financed by a large base of interest-bearing liabilities that include client deposits, short-term borrowings, senior notes and long-term debt. short-term borrowings include federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and other borrowings. earning assets also are funded by noninterest-bearing funds, which include demand deposits and stockholders' equity. net interest income is subject to variations in the level and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing funds and their relative sensitivity to interest rates. in addition, the levels of nonaccruing assets and client compensating deposit balances used to pay for services impact net interest income.
net interest margin is the difference between what we earn on our assets and what we pay for deposits and other sources of funding. the direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings. net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income by average interest-earning assets.
net interest income stated on an fte basis is a non-gaap financial measure that facilitates the analysis of asset yields. management believes an fte presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest margins for comparative purposes. when adjusted to an fte basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable, and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an fte basis has no impact on net income. a reconciliation of net interest income on a gaap basis to net interest income on an fte basis is provided in "supplemental information-reconciliation to fully taxable equivalent" within this "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" section.

(1) northern trust's non-u.s. activities are primarily related to its asset servicing, asset management, foreign exchange, cash management, and commercial banking businesses. the operations of northern trust are managed on a reporting segment basis and include components of both u.s and non-u.s. source income and assets. non-u.s. source income and assets are not separately identified in northern trust's internal management reporting system. however, northern trust is required to disclose non-u.s. activities based on the domicile of the customer. due to the complex and integrated nature of northern trust's activities, it is difficult to segregate with precision revenues, expenses and assets between u.s. and non-u.s.-domiciled customers. on the basis of averages, the percentage of total assets attributable to foreign activities was 17%, 18%, and 19% as of december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. on the basis of averages, the percentage of total liabilities attributable to foreign activities was 52%, 55%, and 58% as of december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. for additional information, refer to the geographic area information section of note 31, "reporting segments and related information," provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
(2) interest-bearing due from and deposits with banks includes the interest-bearing component of cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with banks as presented on the consolidated balance sheets.
(3) includes the impact of balance sheet netting under master netting arrangements of approximately $29.1 billion and $3.6 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively. excluding the impact of netting, the average interest rate on securities purchased under agreements to resell would be approximately 5.27% and 2.23% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. excluding the impact of netting, the average interest rate on securities sold under agreements to repurchase would be approximately 5.22% and 2.27% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. northern trust nets securities sold under repurchase agreements against those purchased under resale agreements when there is a legally enforceable master netting arrangement.
(4) average balances include nonaccrual loans.
(5) other interest-earning assets include certain community development investments, collateral deposits with certain securities depositories and clearing houses, federal home loan bank and federal reserve stock, and money market investments which are classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
(6) cash and due from banks and other central bank deposits includes the noninterest-bearing component of federal reserve and other central bank deposits on the consolidated balance sheets.
(7) other borrowings primarily includes advances from the federal home loan bank of chicago.
(8) rate calculations are based on actual balances rather than the rounded amounts presented in the average consolidated balance sheets with analysis of net interest income.

notes:    net interest income (fte), a non-gaap financial measure, includes adjustments to a fully taxable equivalent basis for loans, securities and other interest-earning assets. the adjustments are based on a federal income tax rate of 21.0%, where the rate is adjusted for applicable state income taxes, net of related federal tax benefit. total taxable equivalent interest adjustments amounted to $57.5 million in 2023, $45.6 million in 2022 and $35.6 million in 2021. a reconciliation of net interest income and net interest margin on a gaap basis to net interest income and net interest margin on an fte basis (each of which is a non-gaap financial measure) is provided in "supplemental information-reconciliation to fully taxable equivalent" within this "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" section. net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income by average interest-earning assets.
interest revenue on cash collateral positions is reported above within interest-bearing due from and deposits with banks and within loans and leases. interest expense on cash collateral positions is reported above within non-u.s. offices interest-bearing deposits. related cash collateral received from and deposited with derivative counterparties is recorded net of the associated derivative contract in other assets and other liabilities, respectively.
net interest income in 2023 increased from 2022. net interest income, stated on an fte basis, increased from 2022, due to a higher net interest margin, partially offset by lower levels of average earning assets. average earning assets in 2023 decreased from 2022, primarily due to lower client deposits, partially offset by higher borrowing activity, the net of which resulted in lower funding of earning assets.
the net interest margin in 2023 increased from 2022. the net interest margin on an fte basis in 2023 increased from 2022, primarily due to higher average interest rates, partially offset by an unfavorable funding mix shift.
federal reserve and other central bank deposits averaged $31.2 billion in 2023, which decreased $5.0 billion, or 14%, from $36.2 billion in 2022, due to deposit outflows. interest-bearing due from and deposits with banks averaged $4.3 billion in 2023 and $4.2 billion in 2022. average securities were $49.9 billion and decreased $5.1 billion, or 9%, from $55.0 billion in 2022. average taxable securities were $46.8 billion in 2023 and $52.4 billion in 2022. average nontaxable securities, which represent securities that are primarily exempt from u.s. federal and state income taxes, were $3.1 billion in 2023 and $2.6 billion in 2022.
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations loans averaged $42.2 billion in 2023, which increased $1.2 billion, or 3%, from $41.0 billion in 2022, primarily reflecting higher levels of commercial real estate, commercial and institutional, and private client loans, partially offset by non-u.s. loans. commercial real estate loans averaged $5.0 billion in 2023 and increased $549.4 million, or 12%, from $4.4 billion for 2022. commercial and institutional loans averaged $12.4 billion in 2023 and increased $180.0 million, or 1%, from $12.3 billion for 2022. private client loans averaged $14.0 billion in 2023 and increased $122.3 million, or 1%, from $13.9 billion for 2022. non-u.s. loans averaged $3.4 billion in 2023 and decreased $101.8 million, or 3%, from $3.5 billion for 2022. residential real estate loans averaged $6.4 billion in 2023 and was relatively unchanged from $6.4 billion for 2022.
average other interest-earning assets include certain community development investments, collateral deposits with certain securities depositories and clearing houses, federal home loan bank stock, money market investments, and federal reserve stock of $899.2 million, $825.2 million, $364.6 million, $84.3 million, and $70.0 million, respectively, which are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
northern trust utilizes a diverse mix of funding sources. average interest-bearing deposits decreased $8.8 billion, or 9%, to $87.5 billion in 2023 from $96.3 billion in 2022. interest expense for interest-bearing deposits in the current year was driven by higher interest rates. average non-u.s. offices interest-bearing deposits comprised 69% and 68% of total average interest-bearing deposits for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. average total interest-bearing liabilities increased $1.1 billion, or 1%, to $108.7 billion in 2023 from $107.6 billion in 2022. the balances within short-term borrowing classifications vary based on funding requirements and strategies, interest rate levels, changes in the volume of lower-cost deposit sources, and the availability of collateral to secure these borrowings. average net noninterest-bearing funds decreased $9.1 billion, or 29%, to $22.1 billion in 2023 from $31.2 billion in 2022, primarily resulting from lower levels of demand and other noninterest-bearing deposits. average demand and other noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $11.6 billion, or 40%, to $17.7 billion in 2023 from $29.3 billion in 2022. the average rate on total source of funds was 4.07% in 2023 and 0.70% in 2022.
stockholders' equity stockholders' equity averaged $11.5 billion in 2023, compared with $11.1 billion in 2022. the increase in average stockholders' equity of $415.4 million, or 4%, was primarily due to higher retained earnings. during the year ended december 31, 2023, the corporation maintained its quarterly common stock dividend at $0.75 per share. during the year ended december 31, 2023, the corporation, through common stock dividends and repurchase of 4,384,678 shares of common stock, returned $977.7 million in capital to common stockholders. during the year ended december 31, 2022, the corporation increased its quarterly common stock dividend to $0.75 per share in the third quarter from $0.70 per share in the second quarter. during the year ended december 31, 2022, the corporation, through common stock dividends and repurchase of 311,536 shares of common stock, returned $648.4 million in capital to common stockholders.
the corporation's current stock repurchase authorization to repurchase up to 25.0 million shares was approved by the board of directors in october 2021. shares are repurchased by the corporation to, among other things, manage the corporation's capital levels. repurchased shares are used for general purposes, including the issuance of shares under stock option and other equity incentive plans. the repurchase authorization approved by the board of directors has no expiration date, thus the corporation retains the ability to resume repurchases thereunder when circumstances warrant and applicable regulations permit. please refer to note 13, "stockholders' equity," provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
provision for credit losses there was a $24.5 million provision for credit losses in 2023, as compared to a provision for credit losses of $12.0 million in 2022. the provision during 2023 was primarily due to a $16.5 million increase in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis, which relates to pooled financial assets sharing similar risk characteristics. the increase in the provision for loans was primarily seen in the commercial real estate portfolio, driven by an increase in the size and duration of the portfolio, weaker economic projections for the industry, methodology updates, and credit quality deterioration on a small number of loans. the release of credit reserves in undrawn loan commitments and letters of credit during the year ended december 31, 2023 is primarily in the commercial and institutional portfolio, reflecting a combination of credit quality improvements, an improved macroeconomic outlook for that segment, and methodology updates. the remainder of the provision was due to $5.0 million in charge-offs and a $3.0 million increase in the individual reserve. the prior-year provision primarily reflected an increase in the reserve evaluated on a collective basis, driven by weaker macroeconomic conditions at the time and portfolio growth, partially offset by improvements in credit quality. the increase in the collective basis reserve was primarily reflected in certain commercial portfolios.
net charge-offs in 2023 totaled $5.0 million resulting from $8.7 million of charge-offs and $3.7 million of recoveries, compared to net recoveries of $4.2 million in 2022 resulting from $6.0 million of charge-offs and $10.2 million of recoveries. for additional discussion of the allowance for credit losses, refer to the "asset quality" section.

outside services outside services expense in 2023 increased from 2022, primarily reflecting higher technical services costs, partially offset by lower consulting services.
equipment and software equipment and software expense in 2023 increased from 2022, primarily due to higher software amortization and higher software costs.
occupancy occupancy expense in 2023 increased from 2022, primarily due to net rent increases and charges related to reducing northern trust's real estate footprint.

northern trust is organized around its two client-focused reporting segments: asset servicing and wealth management. asset management and related services are provided to asset servicing and wealth management clients primarily by the asset management business. the revenue and expenses of asset management and certain other support functions are allocated fully to asset servicing and wealth management.
reporting segment financial information, presented on an internal management-reporting basis, is determined by accounting systems used to allocate revenue and expense to each segment, and incorporates processes for allocating assets, liabilities, equity and the applicable interest income and expense utilizing a funds transfer pricing (ftp) methodology. under the methodology, assets and liabilities receive a funding charge or credit that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other product characteristics on an instrument level. additionally, segment information is presented on a fully taxable equivalent (fte) basis as management believes an fte presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest income. the adjustment to an fte basis has no impact on net income.
equity is allocated to the reporting segments based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, risk, regulatory considerations, and internal metrics. allocations of capital and certain corporate expense may not be representative of levels that would be required if the segments were independent entities. the accounting policies used for management reporting are consistent with those described in note 1, "summary of significant accounting policies." transfers of income and expense items are recorded at cost; there is no consolidated profit or loss on sales or transfers between reporting segments. northern trust's presentations are not necessarily consistent with similar information for other financial institutions.
revenues, expenses and average assets are allocated to asset servicing and wealth management, with the exception of non-recurring activities such as certain corporate transactions and costs incurred associated with acquisitions, divestitures, litigation, restructuring, and tax adjustments not directly attributable to a specific reporting segment, which are reported within the other segment.
reporting segment results are subject to reclassification when organizational changes are made. the results are also subject to refinements in revenue and expense allocation methodologies, which are typically reflected on a prospective basis.

2023 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset servicing net income asset servicing net income decreased in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily reflecting higher noninterest expense and lower foreign exchange trading income, partially offset by higher net interest income and lower provision for income taxes.

asset servicing foreign exchange trading income foreign exchange trading income for 2023 decreased from 2022, primarily driven by lower volatility, a decline in client volumes, and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange swap activity in treasury that is allocated to asset servicing.
asset servicing other noninterest income other noninterest income for 2023 increased from 2022, primarily due to higher other operating income, partially offset by lower treasury management fees.
asset servicing net interest income net interest income on an fte basis increased in 2023 from 2022, primarily due to higher average interest rates. net interest margin on an fte basis increased to 1.29% from 1.03%. average earning assets of $92.5 billion, decreased $12.3 billion, or 12%, from $104.8 billion in the prior year. the earning assets in asset servicing consisted primarily of intercompany assets and loans. funding sources were primarily comprised of non-u.s. custody-related interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $60.0 billion in 2023 as compared to $65.0 billion in 2022.
asset servicing provision for credit losses there was a provision for credit losses of $0.5 million for 2023 compared to a provision for credit losses of $2.4 million for 2022. the 2023 provision for credit losses was primarily due to credit quality deterioration on a small number of loans, offset by a better overall macroeconomic outlook. the provision for credit losses during 2022 primarily reflected weaker macroeconomic conditions at the time.
asset servicing noninterest expense asset servicing noninterest expense, which includes the direct expense of the reporting segment, indirect expense allocations for product and operating support, and indirect expense allocations for certain corporate support services, increased in 2023 from 2022. the increase primarily reflects higher expense allocations.

average balances are considered to be a better measure of balance sheet trends, as period-end balances can be impacted by the timing of deposit and withdrawal activity involving large client balances. average earning assets decreased from the
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations prior year primarily due to lower client deposits, partially offset by higher borrowing activity, the net of which resulted in lower funding of earning assets.
select earning assets. average securities decreased from the prior year, reflecting the impact of repositioning. for additional discussion relating to the securities portfolio, refer to the "asset quality" section in this md&a and to note 4, "securities" to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data".
client deposits. average interest-bearing deposits and demand and other noninterest-bearing deposits decreased from the prior year as clients migrated into higher yielding products.
short-term borrowings. short-term borrowings includes federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and other borrowings. securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financings and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were sold plus accrued interest. to minimize any potential credit risk associated with these transactions, the fair value of the securities sold is monitored, limits are set on exposure with counterparties, and the financial condition of counterparties is regularly assessed. securities sold under agreements to repurchase are held by the counterparty until the repurchase. see note 24, "commitments and contingent liabilities," note 26, "securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase," and note 27, "offsetting of assets and liabilities" to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" for additional information on northern trust's repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.
stockholders' equity. the increase in average stockholders' equity was primarily due to higher retained earnings.

as of both december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, 2% of htm debt securities not rated by moody's, s&p global or fitch ratings primarily consisted of certificates of deposit with a remaining life of less than six months, as well as investments purchased by northern trust to fulfill its obligations under the community reinvestment act (cra). northern trust fulfills its obligations under the cra by making qualified investments for purposes of supporting institutions and programs that benefit low-to-moderate income communities within northern trust's market area.
net unrealized losses within the investment securities portfolio totaled $2.3 billion at december 31, 2023, compared to net unrealized losses of $3.2 billion as of december 31, 2022. net unrealized losses as of december 31, 2023 were comprised of $20.1 million and $2.3 billion of gross unrealized gains and losses, respectively. net unrealized losses as of december 31, 2022 were comprised of $9.1 million and $3.2 billion of gross unrealized gains and losses, respectively.
as of december 31, 2023, the $23.1 billion afs debt securities portfolio had unrealized losses of $200.3 million, $105.8 million, and $100.0 million related to government sponsored agency, sub-sovereign, supranational and non-u.s. agency bonds, and other asset-backed, respectively, which are primarily attributable to lower yields and tighter spreads. as of december 31, 2022, the $26.7 billion afs debt securities portfolio had unrealized losses of $351.6 million, $288.1 million, and $157.6 million related to government-sponsored agency, other asset-backed, and sub-sovereign supranational and non-u.s. agency bonds, respectively, which are primarily attributable to changes in market interest rates and credit spreads since their purchase.
as of december 31, 2023, the $26.2 billion htm debt securities portfolio had an unrealized loss of $1.0 billion and $294.9 million related to government sponsored agency and sub-sovereign, supranational and non-u.s. agency bonds, respectively, which are primarily attributable to lower yields and tighter spreads. as of december 31, 2022, the $25.0 billion htm debt securities portfolio had an unrealized loss of $1.1 billion and $436.1 million related to government-sponsored agency and sub-sovereign, supranational and non-u.s. agency bonds, respectively, which are primarily attributable to changes in overall market interest rates and credit spreads since their purchase.
htm debt securities consist of securities that management intends to, and northern trust has the ability to, hold until maturity. during the year ended december 31, 2023, there were no securities transferred from afs to htm. during the year ended december 31, 2022, the corporation transferred government sponsored agency and obligation of states and political subdivisions securities that had a fair value of $6.6 billion from afs to htm classification for capital management purposes, all of which were transferred in the third quarter of 2022. upon transfer of a debt security from the afs to htm classification, the amortized cost is reset to fair value. any net unrealized gain or loss at the date of transfer will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (aoci) and be amortized into net interest income over the remaining life of the securities using the effective interest method. the amortization of amounts retained in aoci will offset the effect on interest income of the amortization of the premium or discount resulting from transferring the securities at fair value.

allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses-which represents management's best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses related to various portfolios subject to credit risk, off-balance sheet credit exposure, and specific borrower relationships-is determined by management through a disciplined credit review process. northern trust measures expected credit losses of financial assets with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis. a financial asset is measured individually if it does not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets and the related allowance is determined through an individual evaluation.
management's estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption. in determining an appropriate allowance level, management evaluates numerous variables, many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates, and takes into consideration past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.
the results of the credit reserve estimation methodology are reviewed quarterly by northern trust's credit loss reserve committee, which receives input from financial risk management, treasury, corporate finance, the economic research department, and each of northern trust's reporting business units.
as of december 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses related to loans, undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit, htm debt securities, and other financial assets, was $178.7 million, $26.9 million, $12.7 million, and $0.9 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2022, the allowance for credit losses related to loans, undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit, htm debt securities, and other financial assets, was $144.3 million, $38.5 million, $16.0 million, and $0.8 million, respectively. for additional information relating to the allowance for credit losses and the changes in the allowance for credit losses during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 due to

allowance related to credit exposure evaluated on an individual basis: the individual allowance is determined through individual evaluations of loans and lending-related commitments that have defaulted, generally those with borrower ratings of 8 and 9, that are based on expected future cash flows, the value of collateral, and other factors that may impact the borrower's ability to pay.
the allowance evaluated on an individual basis for loans increased $3.0 million from $10.4 million at december 31, 2022 to $13.4 million at december 31, 2023, primarily attributable to a net increase in outstanding loans in the private client portfolio and commercial portfolio.
allowance related to credit exposure evaluated on a collective basis: expected credit losses are measured on a collective basis as long as the financial assets included in the respective pool share similar risk characteristics. if financial assets are deemed not to share similar risk characteristics, an individual assessment is warranted.
the allowance evaluated on a collective basis for loans increased $31.4 million to $165.3 million at december 31, 2023, compared with $133.9 million at december 31, 2022, primarily seen in the commercial real estate portfolio, driven by an increase in the size and duration of the portfolio, weaker economic projections for the industry, and methodology updates. the remainder of the provision was due to charge-offs. the allowance evaluated on a collective basis for undrawn loan commitments and letters of credit decreased $11.6 million to $26.9 million at december 31, 2023, compared with $38.5 million at december 31, 2022, primarily in the commercial and institutional portfolio, reflecting a combination of credit quality improvements, an improved macroeconomic outlook for that segment, and methodology updates.
overall allowance: the reserve evaluated on an individual and collective basis resulted in a total allowance for credit losses of $220.4 million at december 31, 2023, compared with $200.9 million at the end of 2022. the allowance of $178.7 million assigned to loans, as a percentage of total loans, was 0.38% at december 31, 2023, which increased from a $144.3 million allowance assigned to loans, representing 0.34% of total loans at december 31, 2022. allowances assigned to undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit totaled $26.9 million and $38.5 million at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

deposits not insured by the fdic as of december 31, 2023 and 2022 totaled $109.9 billion and $116.1 billion, respectively. these deposit amounts are derived by adding estimated u.s. office uninsured deposits as allowed by federal financial institutions examination council instructions to all non-u.s. office deposits. estimated uninsured u.s. office deposits are determined by calculating and totaling the deposits in excess of the deposit insurance limit on an individual account basis.
short-term borrowings securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financings and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. to minimize any potential credit risk associated with these transactions, the fair value of the securities purchased or sold is monitored, limits are set on exposure with counterparties, and the financial condition of counterparties is regularly assessed. it is northern trust's policy to take possession, either directly or via third-party custodians, of securities purchased under agreements to resell. securities sold under agreements to repurchase are either directly held by, or pledged to the counterparty until the repurchase. northern trust nets securities sold under agreements to repurchase against those purchased under agreements to resell when the requirements to net are met. see note 24, "commitments and contingent liabilities," note 26, "securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase," and note 27, "offsetting of assets and liabilities" provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" for additional information on our repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations geographic area information northern trust's non-u.s. activities are primarily related to its asset servicing, asset management, foreign exchange, cash management, and commercial banking businesses. the operations of northern trust are managed on a reporting segment basis and include components of both u.s and non-u.s. source assets. non-u.s. source assets are not separately identified in northern trust's internal management reporting system. however, northern trust is required to disclose non-u.s. activities based on the domicile of the customer. due to the complex and integrated nature of northern trust's activities, it is difficult to segregate with precision assets between u.s. and non-u.s.-domiciled customers. therefore, certain subjective estimates and assumptions have been made to allocate assets between u.s. and non-u.s. operations.
the following tables present selected average assets and liabilities attributable to non-u.s. operations (based on the obligor's domicile) and the percent of those balances to total consolidated average assets. for additional information refer to note 31, "reporting segments and related information," provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."

non-u.s. outstandings as used in this discussion, non-u.s. outstandings are cross-border outstandings as defined by the sec. they consist of loans, securities, interest-bearing deposits with financial institutions, accrued interest and other monetary assets. not included are letters of credit, loan commitments, and non-u.s. office local currency claims on residents. non-u.s. outstandings related to a country are net of guarantees given by third parties resident outside the country and the value of tangible, liquid collateral realizable outside the country. however, transactions with branches of non-u.s. banks are included in these outstandings and are classified according to the country location of the non-u.s. bank's head office.
short-term interbank time deposits with non-u.s. banks represent the largest category of non-u.s. outstandings. northern trust actively participates in the interbank market with u.s. and non-u.s. banks.
northern trust places deposits with non-u.s. counterparties that have strong internal (northern trust) risk ratings and external credit ratings. these non-u.s. banks are approved and monitored by northern trust's capital markets credit committee, which has credit authority for exposure to all non-u.s. banks and approves credit limits. this process includes financial analysis of the non-u.s. banks, use of an internal risk rating system and consideration of external market indicators. each counterparty is reviewed at least annually and potentially more frequently based on credit fundamentals or general market conditions. separate from the entity-specific review process, the average life to maturity of deposits with non-u.s. banks is deliberately maintained on a short-term basis in order to respond quickly to changing credit conditions. northern trust also utilizes certain risk mitigation tools and agreements that may reduce exposures through use of collateral and/or balance sheet netting. additionally, the capital markets credit committee oversees country-risk analyses and imposes limits on country exposure. for additional information refer to note 31, "reporting segments and related information," provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."

capital management one of northern trust's primary objectives is to maintain a strong capital position to merit the confidence of clients, counterparties, creditors, regulators and stockholders. a strong capital position helps northern trust execute its strategies and withstand unforeseen adverse developments.
senior management, with oversight from the capital governance committee of the board of directors and the full board of directors, is responsible for capital management and planning. northern trust manages its capital on both a total corporation basis and a legal entity basis. the capital committee is responsible for measuring and managing capital metrics against levels set forth within the capital policy approved by the capital governance committee of the board of directors. in establishing the metrics related to capital, a variety of factors are taken into consideration, including the unique risk profiles of northern trust's businesses, regulatory requirements, capital levels relative to peers, economic and market forecasts, and the impact on credit ratings.
capital levels increased in 2023 as average stockholders' equity increased $415.4 million, or 4%, to $11.5 billion. total stockholders' equity was $11.9 billion at december 31, 2023, as compared to $11.3 billion at december 31, 2022. preferred dividends totaling $41.8 million were declared in 2023. during 2023, the corporation maintained its quarterly common stock dividend at $0.75 per common share. common dividends totaling $630.2 million were declared in 2023. during the year ended december 31, 2023, the corporation repurchased 4,384,678 shares of common stock, including 378,130 shares withheld related to share-based compensation, at an average price per share of $79.26.
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in accordance with basel iii requirements, capital ratios are calculated using both the standardized and advanced approaches. as required by the dodd-frank act, the lower of each capital ratio calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approach serves as the effective ratio for purposes of determining capital adequacy. the following table provides a reconciliation of the corporation's common stockholders' equity to total risk-based capital and its risk-based capital ratios, under the applicable u.s. regulatory rules as of december 31, 2023 and 2022.

as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, the corporation's capital ratios exceeded the requirements for classification as "well-capitalized" under applicable u.s. regulatory requirements.
northern trust is a category ii institution as defined by the federal reserve board which requires us to adhere to regulatory capital standards. in adhering to these standards, northern trust engages in a range of reporting and activities with regulators to affirm our financial strength and stability, including but not limited to, capital adequacy reporting that deducts any unrealized losses related to afs securities from reported capital, and stringent, annual company-run and supervisory stress testing in the form of comprehensive capital analysis and review (ccar) exercises, which confirms our ability to remain solvent under severely adverse market conditions.
the results of the 2023 dfast, published by the federal reserve board on june 28, 2023, resulted in northern trust's stress capital buffer and effective common equity tier 1 capital ratio minimum requirement remaining constant at 2.5% and 7.0%, respectively, for the annual capital plan cycle, which began on october 1, 2023 and continues through september 30, 2024.
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on july 27, 2023, the u.s. banking regulators issued the basel iii endgame proposal, which would change how risk-based capital requirements are determined for banking organizations including northern trust. the proposal would eliminate the existing advanced approach methodologies for determining rwas and replace it with a new expanded risk based approach. the new requirements would be phased in over a three year period beginning july 1, 2025. based on our current understanding of the proposed rule, we estimate that, if the expanded risk-based approach had applied on a fully phased-in basis as of december 31, 2023, and in the absence of taking any actions to mitigate its impact, our expanded risk-based approach rwas as of that date would have been approximately 5% to 15% higher than our actual standardized approach rwas as of that date.

critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1, "summary of significant accounting policies," provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data." the use of estimates and assumptions is required in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap and actual results could differ from those estimates. the sec has issued guidance relating to the disclosure of critical accounting estimates. critical accounting estimates are those that require management to make subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. changes that may be required in the underlying assumptions or estimates in these areas could have a material impact on northern trust's future financial condition and results of operations.
for northern trust, accounting estimates that are viewed as critical are those relating to the allowance for credit losses and pension plan accounting. management has discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of the board of directors (audit committee).
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses-which represents management's estimate of lifetime expected credit losses related to various portfolios subject to credit risk, off-balance sheet credit exposure, and specific borrower relationships-is determined by management through a disciplined credit review process. northern trust measures expected credit losses of financial assets with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis. the allowance for a financial asset that does not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets is determined through an individual evaluation.
management's estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption. in determining an appropriate allowance level, management evaluates numerous variables, many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates, and takes into consideration past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. due to the inherent imprecision in accounting estimates, other estimates or assumptions could reasonably have been used in 2023 and changes in estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period.
the allowance for credit losses consists of the following components:
allowance evaluated on a collective basis. expected credit losses are measured on a collective basis as long as the financial assets included in the respective pool share similar risk characteristics. if financial assets are deemed not to share similar risk characteristics, an individual assessment is warranted.
the allowance estimation methodology for the collective assessment is based on data representative of the corporation's financial asset portfolio from a historical observation period that includes both expansionary and recessionary periods. the estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment framework segregate the loan portfolio into segments based on loan and obligor-specific factors, including loan type, borrower type, collateral type, loan size, and borrower credit quality. for each segment, the probability of default and loss given default are derived for each quarter of the remaining life of each instrument. for the first two years (the reasonable and supportable period), these factors are derived by applying quarterly macroeconomic projections using models developed from historical data on macroeconomic factors and loans with similar characteristics. for periods beyond the reasonable and supportable period, northern trust reverts to its long-run historical loss experiences on a straight-line basis over four quarters. the projected exposure at default for every quarter is based on contractual balance projections as of each quarter-end, with adjustments made for potential draws on off-balance sheet commitments.
northern trust utilizes a quantitative probability of default/loss given default approach for the calculation of its credit allowance on a collective basis. for each segment, the probability of default and the loss given default are applied to the exposure at default for each projected quarter to determine the quantitative component of the allowance. the quantitative allowance is then reviewed within a qualitative adjustment framework, through which management applies judgment by
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations assessing internal risk factors, potential limitations in the quantitative methodology, and environmental factors that are not fully contemplated in the forecast to compute an adjustment to the quantitative allowance for each segment and class of the loan portfolio.
asc 326-20-30 requires the use of projected macroeconomic factors. the corporation uses multiple forecasts approved by northern trust's macroeconomic scenario development committee (msdc). the baseline forecast aligns with the corporation's latest thinking on macroeconomic projections for the next eight quarters. an alternative scenario is also considered, which reflects a recession that incorporates the experiences of a wider set of historical economic cycles. the forecasts are probability-weighted at each evaluation period and are management's best estimate of future economic projections at that time.
the allowance estimate is sensitive to changes in portfolio composition, portfolio quality, and macroeconomic forecasts. increases in the amount of borrowing and material downgrades to the quality of the lending portfolio will increase the reserve, all else equal. similarly, deteriorating projections for macroeconomic conditions will increase the reserve. macroeconomic factors that are particularly correlated to northern trust's loan portfolio are equity market values, market volatility, corporate profits, residential and commercial real estate price indices, unemployment, and disposable income. to demonstrate the sensitivity to changes in macroeconomic conditions, northern trust applied a 100% probability weighting to downturn conditions, resulting in an increase to the collective component of the allowance for the loan portfolio of approximately $121.2 million. the investment security and other financial assets portfolios are less sensitive to macroeconomic factors in terms of overall reserve impact due to factors such as high credit quality, short duration, and low historical losses.
the commercial and institutional (c&i) portfolio utilizes northern trust's internal borrower rating assessments to determine initial credit quality. a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of upgrades or downgrades by shifting the rating up or down by one rating class, assuming no changes to other factors, such as macroeconomic projections or qualitative adjustments. the analysis excludes defaulted loans and does not assume a default event; hence, borrowers at the lowest non-default rating were not downgraded. similarly, those at the highest rating could not be upgraded. assuming the final forecast probability weighting, the collective component of the allowance assigned to the c&i portfolio would increase by approximately $82.3 million if all c&i borrowers were downgraded by one performing rating class. the c&i collective allowance would decrease by approximately $32.4 million if borrower ratings were upgraded by one rating class (if possible).
the results of the credit reserve estimation methodology are reviewed quarterly by northern trust's credit loss reserve committee, which receives input from financial risk management, treasury, corporate finance, the economic research department, and each of northern trust's reporting business units. the credit loss reserve committee determines the probability weights applied to each forecast approved by msdc, and also reviews and approves qualitative adjustments to the collective allowance in line with northern trust's qualitative adjustment framework.
allowance evaluated on an individual basis. the individual allowance is determined through individual evaluations of financial assets that have defaulted, based on expected future cash flows, the value of collateral, and other factors that may impact the borrowers' ability to pay. for defaulted loans for which the amount of allowance, if any, is determined based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral, third-party appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management. these appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect management's judgment as to the realizable value of the collateral.
analysis and controls. the quarterly analysis of the individual and collective allowance components and the control process maintained by financial risk management and the lending staff are the principal methods relied upon by management for the timely identification and estimation of individual expected credit losses. in addition to northern trust's own experience, management also considers regulatory guidance. control processes and analyses employed to determine an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are reviewed at least annually and modified as considered appropriate.
management believes that the allowance for credit losses adequately considers these uncertainties and has been established at an appropriate level. actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision for credit losses may be greater or less than actual net charge-offs in any particular period.
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pension plan accounting northern trust maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all u.s. employees (u.s. qualified plan) and a u.s. noncontributory supplemental pension plan (u.s. non-qualified plan). certain european-based employees also retain benefits in local defined benefit pension plans, of which the majority are closed to new employees and to future benefit accruals. measuring cost and reporting liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires the use of several assumptions regarding future interest rates, asset returns, compensation increases, mortality rates, and other actuarial-based projections relating to the plans. due to the long-term nature of this obligation and the estimates that are required to be made, the assumptions used in determining the periodic pension expense and the projected benefit obligation are closely monitored and reviewed annually for adjustments that may be required. pension accounting guidance requires that differences between estimates and actual experience be recognized as other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. the differences are amortized into net periodic pension expense from accumulated other comprehensive income over the average remaining service period of eligible participants. as a result, differences between the estimates made in the calculation of periodic pension expense and the projected benefit obligation and actual experience affect stockholders' equity in the period in which they occur but continue to be recognized as expense systematically and gradually over subsequent periods.
northern trust recognizes the significant impact that these pension-related assumptions have on the determination of the pension obligations and related expense and has established procedures for monitoring and setting these assumptions each year. these procedures include an annual review of actual demographic and investment experience with the pension plans' actuaries. in addition to actual experience, adjustments to these assumptions consider observable yields on fixed income securities, known compensation trends and policies, as well as economic conditions and investment strategies that may impact the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets.
in determining the pension expense for the u.s. qualified plan and for the u.s. non-qualified plan in 2023, northern trust utilized a discount rate of 5.22% and 5.15% as of december 31, 2022, respectively. for both plans, the rate of increase in the compensation level is based on a graded schedule from 9.00% to 2.50% that averaged 5.56%. the expected long-term rate of return on u.s. qualified plan assets was 7.25% as of december 31, 2022.
in evaluating possible revisions to pension-related assumptions for the u.s. pension plans as of northern trust's december 31, 2023 measurement date, the following were considered:
•discount rate: northern trust estimates the discount rate for its u.s. pension plans by applying the plan specific projected cash flows for future benefit payments for each plan to the aon aa above median yield curve as of the measurement date. this yield curve is composed of individual zero-coupon interest rates for 198 different time periods over a 99-year time horizon. zero-coupon rates utilized by the yield curve are mathematically derived from observable market yields for aa-rated corporate bonds. this yield curve model referenced by northern trust in establishing the discount rate resulted in a rate of 5.03% and 4.95% at december 31, 2023 for the u.s. qualified and u.s. non-qualified plans, respectively.
•compensation level: based on a review of actual and anticipated salary experience, the compensation scale assumption is based on a graded schedule from 9.00% to 2.50% that averages 5.56%.
•rate of return on plan assets: the expected return on plan assets is based on an estimate of the long-term (30 years) rate of return on plan assets, which is determined using a building block approach that considers the current asset mix and estimates of return by asset class based on historical experience, giving proper consideration to diversification and rebalancing. current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are also evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness. as a result of these analyses, northern trust's rate of return assumption for the u.s. qualified plan will continue to be 7.25% for 2024.
•mortality table: northern trust had adopted the aggregate pri-2012 mortality table with a 2012 base year, which was released by the society of actuaries in october 2019. northern trust's pension obligations reflect proposed future improvement under scale mp-2021, which was released by the society of actuaries in october 2021. as was the case in 2022, no change to these assumptions was made in 2023 since the society of actuaries did not release any updates to its mortality tables and improvement scales in 2023. mortality assumptions on lump sum payments remain static and continue to be in line with the irs prescribed table for minimum lump sums in 2024.
the net pension expense in 2024 is expected to slightly increase, primarily driven by higher amortization of prior year's asset losses, offset by the positive effects of the cash contribution made to the u.s. qualified plan at the beginning of 2024.
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in order to illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions on the expected u.s pension plans' 2024 periodic pension expense and the projected benefit obligation as of december 31, 2023, the following table is presented to show the effect of increasing or decreasing each of these assumptions by 25 basis points.

pension contributions. the deduction limits specified by the internal revenue code for contributions made by sponsors of defined benefit pension plans are based on a "target liability" under the provisions of the pension protection act of 2006. there were no contributions to the u.s. qualified plan for the 2023 plan year. $200.0 million was contributed to the u.s. qualified plan for the 2024 plan year at the beginning of 2024.
the minimum required contribution to the u.s. qualified plan is expected to be zero in 2024. the remaining 2024 maximum deductible contribution, after considering the cash contribution of $200.0 million, is estimated at $220.0 million.
recent accounting pronouncements and developments in march 2023, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update (asu) no. 2023-02, "investments-equity method and joint ventures (topic 323): accounting for investments in tax credit structures using the proportional amortization method-a consensus of the emerging issues task force" (asu 2023-02). the amendments in asu 2023-02 permit reporting entities to elect to account for their tax equity investments, regardless of the tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received, using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. under the proportional amortization method, an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received and recognizes the net amortization and income tax credits and other income tax benefits in the income statement as a component of income tax expense (benefit). in addition, asu 2023-02 requires specific disclosures that must be applied to all investments that generate income tax credits and other income tax benefits from a tax credit program for which the entity has elected to apply the proportional amortization method in accordance with subtopic 323-740. asu 2023-02 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2023. northern trust adopted asu 2023-02 as of january 1, 2024 using the modified retrospective method. the adoption of asu 2023-02 is not expected to impact significantly northern trust's consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of income.
in november 2023, the fasb issued asu no. 2023-07, "segment reporting (topic 280): improvements to reportable segment disclosures" (asu 2023-07). asu 2023‐07 significantly expands disclosures about a public entity's reportable segments, primarily through more frequent and enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. asu 2023-07 does not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates those operating segments or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. asu 2023-07 is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2023, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after december 15, 2024. early adoption is permitted. upon adoption, the impact of asu 2023-07 will be limited to certain enhancements within the notes to the consolidated financial statements and therefore is not expected to have an impact on northern trust's consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of income.
in december 2023, the fasb issued asu no. 2023-08, "intangibles-goodwill and other-crypto assets (subtopic 350-60): accounting for and disclosure of crypto assets" (asu 2023-08). asu 2023-08 requires entities to subsequently measure certain crypto assets at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in net income in each reporting period. in addition, asu 2023-08 requires the presentation of crypto assets separately from other intangible assets on the face of the balance sheet and changes in fair value of crypto assets separately from changes in the carrying amount of other intangible assets on the statement of income. asu 2023-08 also requires enhanced disclosures about in-scope crypto assets and respective activities. asu 2023-08 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2024, although

in december 2023, the fasb issued asu no. 2023-09, "income taxes (topic 740): improvements to income tax disclosures" (asu 2023-09). asu 2023-09 enhances disclosures by further disaggregating existing annual income tax disclosures related to the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. asu 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2024, although early adoption is permitted. upon adoption, the impact of asu 2023-09 will be limited to certain enhancements within the notes to the consolidated financial statements and therefore is not expected to have an impact on northern trust's consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of income.
risk management risk management overview northern trust employs an integrated risk management framework to enable a risk informed profile and support its business decisions and the execution of its corporate strategies. the framework provides a methodology to identify, manage, report and govern both internal and external risks to northern trust, and promotes a culture of risk awareness and good conduct across the organization. northern trust's risk culture encompasses the general awareness, attitude and conduct of employees with respect to risk and the management of risk across all lines of defense within the organization. northern trust cultivates a culture of effective risk management by defining and embedding risk management accountabilities in all employee performance expectations and provides training, development and performance rewards to reinforce this culture.
northern trust's risk management framework contains three inter-related elements, designed to support consistent enterprise risk identification, management and reporting: a comprehensive risk inventory, a static taxonomy of risk categories and a dynamic taxonomy of risk themes. the risk inventory is a detailed register of the risks inherently faced by northern trust. the risk categories and risk themes are classification systems used for classifying and managing the risk inventory and enabling different risk profile views. all identified risks inherent in northern trust's business activities are cataloged into the following risk categories: credit, operational, fiduciary, compliance, liquidity, market, and strategic risk. all material risks are also dynamically cataloged into various risk themes which are defined groupings that share common characteristics, focus on business outcomes and span across risk categories.
northern trust implements its risk management framework through a "three lines of defense" operating model, embedding a robust risk management capability within its businesses. the model, used to communicate risk management expectations across the organization, contains three roles, each with a complementary level of risk management accountability. within this operating model, northern trust's businesses are the first line of defense for protecting it against the risks inherent in its businesses and are supported by dedicated business risk management teams. the risk management function, the second line of defense, sets the direction for northern trust's risk management activities and provides aggregate risk oversight and reporting in support of risk governance. audit services, the third line of defense, provides independent assurance as to the effectiveness of the integrated risk framework.
risk governance and oversight overview risk governance is an integral aspect of corporate governance at northern trust, and includes clearly defined accountabilities, expectations, internal controls and processes for risk-based decision-making and escalation of issues. the following diagram provides a high-level overview of northern trust's risk governance structure, highlighting oversight by the board of directors and key risk-related committees.

2023 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations credit risk overview credit risk is inherent in many of northern trust's activities. the bulk of credit risk relates to loans, securities, and wholesale counterparty-related exposures, such as over-the-counter (otc) derivatives and securities financing activities. northern trust's loan portfolio differs significantly from those of other large u.s. financial institutions in that northern trust is generally:
•not an originator of loan products intended to be sold into a secondary market or to be bundled into asset securitizations;
•not an agent bank or syndicator of loans, where risk management is achieved post-close through the sale of participations; and
•not a participant in leveraged financial transactions, such as project finance, hedge fund leveraging, loans to private equity sponsored companies, or prime brokerage activities.
credit risk framework and governance the crc is the most senior credit committee at northern trust, with responsibility for establishing, approving, and monitoring credit-related policies and programs throughout the bank. the chief credit officer reports directly to the cro, chairs the crc, and heads the credit risk management function at northern trust.
the credit risk management function is the focal point of the credit risk framework and, while independent of the business units that manage client relationships, it works closely with them to achieve the goal of assuring proactive management of credit risk. to monitor and control credit risk, the credit risk management function maintains a framework that consists of policies, standards, and programs designed to promote a prudent credit culture and monitors adherence to those internal policies, standards, and programs, as well as external regulations. independent oversight and review of the credit risk framework also is provided by risk control.
the credit risk framework stipulates authority levels for approval of the extension of credit. individual credit authority for commercial and personal loans is limited to specified amounts and maturities. credit requests exceeding policies or standards because of amount, maturity, rating, or other conditions, are referred to the relevant group credit approval committee. credit decisions involving requests in excess of group credit approval committee limits require the approval of the senior credit committee. the capital markets credit committee has sole authority for the approval, modification, or renewal of credit exposure limits to all wholesale market counterparties. the senior credit committee and capital markets credit committee are both direct sub-committees of the crc. the treasury credit committee provides similar approval for investments in assets subject to credit risk, such as bonds and equities.
credit risk measurement the credit risk framework covers a number of different measurements of credit risk at northern trust, including rwa, the allowance for credit losses, and stress tests using various macroeconomic scenarios, such as the internal capital adequacy approval program and ccar.
an integral component of credit risk measurement is northern trust's internal risk rating system. northern trust's internal risk rating system enables identification, measurement, approval and monitoring of the corporation's credit risk. calculations include entity-specific information about the obligor's or counterparty's probability of default (pd) and exposure-specific information about loss given default (lgd), exposure at default (ead), and maturity. northern trust's internal risk rating system is intended to rank its credit risk without any direct linkage to external credit ratings.
obligors are assigned pds after consideration of both quantitative and qualitative factors. although the criteria vary, the objective is for assigned pds to be consistent in the measurement and ranking of risk. lgd and ead are assigned based on obligor, product, collateral and instrument characteristics.
risk ratings are assigned at the time a counterparty or an obligation is approved, renewed, or amended. risk ratings are reviewed annually or when new information relevant to the rating is received. risk ratings are utilized for credit underwriting, management reporting, and the calculation of regulatory capital.
the credit risk management function is responsible for the ongoing oversight of each model that supports the internal risk-rating system. independent model governance and oversight is further supported by the activities of risk control.
loans and other extensions of credit a significant component of credit risk relates to the loan portfolio, including contractual obligations such as legally binding commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. these contractual obligations and arrangements are discussed in note 24, "commitments and contingent liabilities," provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
undrawn commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. since a significant portion of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future loans or liquidity requirements. the following table provides information about the industry sector and expiration dates of undrawn commitments to extend credit as of december 31, 2023 and 2022.

as part of northern trust's credit processes, the credit risk management function oversees a range of portfolio reviews that focus on significant and/or weaker-rated credits. this approach allows management to take remedial action in an effort to deal with potential problems. an integral part of the credit risk management function is a formal review of past due and potential problem loans to determine which credits, if any, need to be placed on nonaccrual status or charged off. northern trust maintains a loan portfolio "watch list" for adversely classified credit exposures that includes all nonaccrual credits as well as other loans with elevated risk of default. independent from the credit risk management function, credit review undertakes both on-site and off-site file reviews that evaluate the effectiveness of management's implementation of credit risk management's requirements.
counterparty credit risk counterparty credit risk for northern trust primarily arises from a variety of funding, treasury, trading and custody-related activities, including trading otc foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives, indemnified securities lending transactions, and sponsored repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions. credit exposure to counterparties is managed by use of a framework for setting limits by product type and exposure tenor.
to calculate exposure, northern trust treats repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, indemnified securities lending, and sponsored repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions as repo-style transactions. foreign exchange exposures and interest rate derivatives are treated as otc derivatives. the exposure at default measurement
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations methodology for each eligible type of counterparty credit exposure, including the use of netting and collateral as risk mitigants, is determined based on regulatory requirements.
credit risk mitigation northern trust considers cash flow to be the primary source of repayment for client-related credit exposures. however, northern trust employs several different types of credit risk mitigants to manage its overall credit risk in the event cash flow is not sufficient to repay a credit exposure. northern trust broadly groups its risk mitigation techniques into the following three primary categories.
physical and financial collateral: one of northern trust's primary credit risk mitigation approaches is the requirement of collateral. residential and commercial real estate exposures are typically secured by properly margined mortgages on the property. various other types of physical and financial collateral are also accepted for certain commercial and personal loans, in line with northern trust's lending standards. in cases where loans to clients are secured by marketable securities, the daily values of the securities are monitored closely to ensure adherence to collateral coverage policies.
netting: on-balance sheet netting is employed where applicable for counterparties with master netting arrangements. netting is primarily related to foreign exchange transactions with major banks and institutional clients subject to eligible master netting arrangements.
guarantees: personal and corporate guarantees are accepted, as warranted, to reduce risk of default, facilitate potential collection efforts, and protect northern trust's claims relative to other creditors.
another important risk management practice is the avoidance of undue concentrations of exposure, such as in any single (or small number of related) obligor/counterparty, loan type, industry, geography, country or risk mitigant. processes are in place to establish limits on certain concentrations and the monitoring of adherence to the limits.
operational risk operational risk is the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, human factors and systems, or from external events.
operational risk overview operational risk is inherent in each of northern trust's businesses and corporate functions and reflects the potential for inadequate information systems, operating problems, challenges related to reliance on third parties, product design and delivery difficulties, potential legal actions or catastrophes to result in losses. this includes the potential that continuity of service and resilience may be impacted.
operational risk includes information technology and cybersecurity, compliance, fiduciary and legal risks, which under the corporation's risk structure are governed and managed explicitly.
operational risk framework and governance to monitor and control operational risk, northern trust maintains a framework consisting of risk management policies, programs and practices designed to promote a sound operational environment and maintain the corporation's operational risk profile and losses within approved risk appetites and guidelines. the framework implements a structured approach to establishing and communicating operational risk management practices and responsibilities. this structured approach to measuring and managing operational risk addresses operational resilience which requires that northern trust minimize service disruptions and limit systemic impacts from adverse events as well as risk quantification. the framework is deployed consistently and globally across all businesses and its objective is to identify and measure the factors that influence risk and drive action to maintain operational resilience and reduce future loss events. the operational risk management function operates within the independent non-financial risk function and is responsible for defining the operational risk management framework and providing independent oversight of the framework implementation and application across northern trust. it is the responsibility of each business to implement the enterprise-wide operational risk framework and business-specific risk management programs to identify, monitor, measure, manage and report on operational risk and mitigate northern trust's exposure to service disruptions and loss. several key programs support the operational risk framework, including:
•loss event data program - a program that collects internal and external loss data for use in monitoring operational risk exposure, various business analyses and the basel advanced measurement approach (ama) capital quantification. both internal and external loss data are used in the operational risk capital quantification. thresholds

•risk and control self-assessment - a comprehensive, structured risk management process used by northern trust's businesses to identify, measure, monitor and mitigate operational risk exposures throughout the enterprise.
•operational risk scenario analysis - a systematic process of obtaining expert opinions from business managers and risk management experts to derive reasoned assessments of the likelihood of occurrence and the potential loss impact of plausible operational losses.
•product and process risk management program - a program used for evaluating and managing risks associated with the introduction of new and modified noncredit products and services and with significant changes to operating processes.
•operational resilience - a program designed to ensure the resilience and continuity of service delivery of northern trust's most important business services.
•third-party risk management program - a program that provides processes for evaluating, quantifying and qualifying appropriate risk assessment, measurement, monitoring and management of third and fourth parties (inclusive of external and internal, e.g., northern trust legal entity to legal entity relationships).
•global fraud risk - a program designed to prevent, detect and respond to attempted or actual fraud impacting the bank and its clients globally.
•data management - a program that embeds data management and data governance related activities into northern trust processes in order to manage data risk.
•data privacy program - a program that sets forth a consistent, global approach to compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations relating to privacy and establishes overarching principles for the responsible use and protection of confidential information.
•cyber and technology risk management - a program that sets forth a consistent, global approach to communicate risk management processes and controls addressing cybersecurity (inclusive of information security), technology, and related compliance risks to the organization. please see item 1c, "cybersecurity," for a detailed discussion of cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance.
•business continuity management program - a program designed to protect life safety, minimize and manage the business impact and support the recovery of critical functions for clients following an incident.
•physical security - a program that provides for the life safety of northern trust partners, clients, and visitors worldwide by setting and enforcing standards, providing training, establishing partnerships, and encouraging continual improvement in workplace security.
•insurance management program - a program designed to reduce the monetary impact of certain operational loss events through the securing of appropriate insurance policy protection.
as discussed in "risk control" above, model risk management also is part of the operational risk framework.
the orc is responsible for overseeing the activities of northern trust related to the management of operational risk including establishing and maintaining the corporate operational risk management policy and approving the operational risk framework and programs. this committee has the expanded role of coordinating operational risk issues related to information technology, cybersecurity, compliance and fiduciary risks. the purpose of this committee is to provide executive management's insight and guidance to the management of existing and emerging operational risks. this includes identification and assessment of evolving risk trends across the operational risk framework and how these can be best managed.
operational risk measurement northern trust utilizes the ama capital quantification process to estimate required capital for the corporation and applicable u.s. banking subsidiaries. northern trust's ama capital quantification process incorporates outputs from the loss event data, risk and control self-assessment and operational risk scenario analysis programs to derive required capital. while internal loss data is the foundation for the capital quantification, external loss event data and qualitative risk and control self-assessments are also utilized to inform the creation of scenario analysis data employed in the capital quantification process. business environment factor information is used to estimate loss frequency. the ama capital quantification process uses a loss distribution approach methodology to combine frequency and severity distributions to arrive at an estimate of the potential aggregate loss at the 99.9th percentile of the aggregate loss distribution over a one-year time horizon.
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operational resilience and recovery management northern trust's operational resilience approach encompasses operational resilience and recovery processes enterprise-wide (including staff, technology and facilities) to anticipate and limit disruptions and to ensure that following a disaster or business interruption northern trust is able to resume critical business functions and fulfill all regulatory and legal requirements.
northern trust's operational resilience mitigation and preventative measures include sophisticated physical security, resilient designs and peer capacity for its corporate data centers, a highly redundant global network, robust network security, resilience centers that offer alternative workstations and transfer of work and work-from-home programs that provide further capability.
all of northern trust's businesses are required to risk-assess all of their functions regularly and develop business continuity plans covering resource requirements (people, systems, vendor relationships and other assets), arrangements for obtaining these resources and prioritizing the resumption of each function in compliance with corporate standards. the business continuity programs of all critical third-party vendors to northern trust are reviewed on a regular basis. all of northern trust's businesses test their plans at least annually. the orc annually reviews and presents the corporate business continuity plan to the business risk committee.
fiduciary risk fiduciary risks are risks arising from the failure: (a) in administering or managing financial and other assets in clients' fiduciary accounts; (b) to adhere to a fiduciary standard of care if required under the terms of governing documents or applicable laws; or (c) to properly discharge fiduciary duties. fiduciary status may hinge on the nature of a particular function being performed and fiduciary standards may vary by jurisdiction, type of relationship, and governing document.
fiduciary risk overview the fiduciary risk management framework identifies, assesses, measures, monitors, and reports on fiduciary risk matters deemed significant. fiduciary risk is best managed at the source of the risk, and is mitigated through internal controls and risk management practices that are designed to identify, understand, and keep such risk at levels consistent with the organization's overall risk appetite while also managing the inherent risk in each client relationship for which northern trust serves in a fiduciary capacity. each business is responsible for complying with all corporate policies and external regulations and for establishing specific procedures, standards, and guidelines to manage fiduciary risk within the desired risk appetite.
fiduciary risk framework and governance the frc is responsible for overseeing activities related to the exercise of fiduciary powers throughout the organization, and for establishing and reviewing the fiduciary risk policies and the fiduciary risk framework that supports the coordination of activities to identify, monitor, manage, and report on fiduciary risk. in addition, the frc serves as an escalation point for significant issues raised by its subcommittees or elsewhere in the organization.
compliance risk compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, other regulatory requirements, or codes of conduct and other standards of self-regulatory organizations applicable to northern trust. compliance risk includes the following two subcategories:
•regulatory risk - risk arising from failure to comply with prudential and conduct of business or other regulatory requirements.
•financial crime risk - risk arising from financial crime (e.g., money laundering, sanctions violations, fraud, insider dealing, theft, etc.) in relation to the products, services, or accounts of the institution, its clients, or others associated with the same.
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations compliance risk framework and governance the compliance risk management framework identifies, assesses, controls, measures, monitors and reports on compliance risk. the framework is designed to minimize compliance risk and maintain an environment in which criminal or regulatory violations do not occur. the framework includes a comprehensive governance structure and a compliance and ethics program approved by the business risk committee.
each business is responsible for the implementation and effectiveness of the compliance and ethics program and specific compliance policies within their respective businesses. each business is responsible for its respective employees' compliance with corporate policies and external regulations and for establishing specific procedures, standards and guidelines to manage compliance risk in accordance with northern trust's compliance and ethics program.
the compliance and ethics oversight committee ("ceoc") oversees and provides direction with respect to the implementation of northern trust's compliance and ethics program and the coordination of compliance initiatives across the enterprise. the ceoc approves policies necessary to effectively manage regulatory and financial crime risk. the chief compliance and ethics officer reports to the business risk committee, as appropriate, and chairs the ceoc.
liquidity risk management liquidity risk overview liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to raise sufficient funds or maintain collateral to meet balance sheet and contingent liability cash flow obligations when due, because of firm-specific or market-wide stress events. northern trust is a category ii institution as defined by the federal reserve board which requires us to adhere to the same regulatory liquidity standards as u.s. gsibs. in adhering to these standards, northern trust engages in a range of reporting and activities with regulators to affirm our financial strength and stability, including but not limited to, daily liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio calculations to regulators.
northern trust maintains a strong liquidity position and liquidity risk profile. northern trust's balance sheet is primarily liability-driven. that is, the main driver of balance sheet changes comes from changing levels of client deposits, which are generally related to the level of custody assets serviced and commercial and personal deposits and can also be influenced by market conditions. this liability-driven business model differs from a typical asset-driven business model, where increased levels of deposits and wholesale borrowings are required to support, for example, increased levels of lending. northern trust's balance sheet is generally comprised of high-quality assets that are managed to meet anticipated obligations under stress, resulting in low liquidity risk.
liquidity risk framework and governance northern trust maintains a liquidity risk framework consisting of risk management policies and practices to keep its risk profile within the board-approved corporate risk appetite statement. all liquidity risk activities are overseen by the risk management function, which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities.
the liquidity management policy and exposure limits for liquidity risk are set by the board of directors, and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies, external regulations and established procedures. limits are monitored based on measures such as the lcr, the nsfr, and the liquidity stress-testing buffer across a range of time horizons. treasury, in the first line of defense, proposes liquidity risk management strategies and is responsible for performing liquidity management activities. the asset and liability management committee (alco) provides first-line management oversight and is responsible for approving strategies and activities within the risk appetite, monitoring risk metrics, overseeing balance sheet resources, and reviewing reporting such as cash flows, lcr, nsfr, and stress test results.
market and liquidity risk management, in the second line of defense, provides challenge to the first-line activities, evaluates compliance with regulatory requirements and process effectiveness, and escalates material items for corrective action. the market and liquidity risk committee (mlrc) provides second-line oversight and is responsible for reviewing market and liquidity risk exposures, approving and monitoring risk metrics, and approving key methodologies and assumptions that drive liquidity risk measurement.
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity risk analysis, monitoring, and reporting liquidity risk is analyzed and monitored in order to ensure compliance with the approved risk appetite. various liquidity analysis and monitoring activities are employed by northern trust to understand better the nature and sources of its liquidity risks, including: liquidity stress testing, liquidity metric monitoring, collateral management, intraday management, cash flow projections, operational deposit modeling, liquid asset buffer measurement, funds transfer pricing, and contingency funding planning.
the liquidity risk management process is supported through management and regulatory reporting. both northern trust's treasury and market and liquidity risk management functions produce management reports that enable oversight bodies to make informed decisions and support management of liquidity risk within the approved risk appetite. holistic liquidity metrics such as lcr, nsfr and internal liquidity stress testing are actively monitored, along with a suite of other metrics that provide early warning indicators of changes in the risk profile.
regulatory environment northern trust actively follows regulatory developments and regularly evaluates its liquidity risk management framework against proposed rule-making and industry best practices in order to comply with applicable regulations and further enhance its liquidity policies. please refer to "supervision and regulation-liquidity standards" in item 1, "business," for a discussion of applicable liquidity standards.
u.s. liquidity coverage ratio (lcr)
the lcr final rule requires covered banking organizations, which include the corporation, to maintain an amount of high-quality liquid assets (hqlas) equal to or greater than 100% of the banking organization's total net cash outflows over a 30 calendar-day standardized supervisory liquid stress scenario. the requirements of the lcr final rule are intended to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of covered banking organizations, improve the banking industry's ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk. the corporation and the bank each satisfied the u.s. liquidity coverage ratio requirements during 2023.
u.s. net stable funding ratio (nsfr)
the nsfr final rule requires covered banking organizations, which include the corporation, to maintain an amount of available stable funding (asf) equal to or greater than the banking organization's projected minimum funding needs, or required stable funding (rsf), over a one-year time horizon. the nsfr is designed to reduce the likelihood that disruptions to a banking organization's regular sources of funding will compromise its liquidity position, promote effective liquidity risk management, and support the ability of banking organizations to provide financial intermediation to businesses and households across a range of market conditions. the nsfr supports financial stability by requiring banking organizations to fund their activities with stable sources of funding on an ongoing basis, reducing the possibility that funding shocks would substantially increase distress at individual banking organizations. the corporation and the bank each satisfied the nsfr requirements during 2023.
funding northern trust maintains a very liquid balance sheet, with cash and due from banks, deposits with the federal reserve and other central banks, short-term money market assets and investment securities in aggregate representing 59% and 63% of total assets as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the market value of unencumbered securities at the bank, which include those placed at the central bank discount window, totaled $39.0 billion and $46.2 billion at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
as the corporation's principal subsidiary encompassing all of northern trust's banking activities, the bank centrally manages liquidity for all u.s. and international banking operations. liquidity is provided by a variety of sources, including client deposits (institutional and personal) from the asset servicing and wealth management businesses, wholesale funding from the capital markets, maturities of short-term investments, interest earned on investment securities and money market assets, federal home loan bank advances, and unencumbered liquid assets that can be sold or pledged to secure additional funds. while management does not view central bank discount windows as primary sources of liquidity, at december 31, 2023 and 2022, the bank had over $34.7 billion and $39.0 billion, respectively of securities and loans readily available as collateral to support discount window borrowings. the bank also is active in the u.s. interbank funding market, providing an important source of additional liquidity and low-cost funds.
the liquidity of the corporation is managed separately from that of the bank. the primary sources of cash for the corporation are issuances of debt or equity and dividend payments from the bank. for further information on issuances or redemptions of debt or equity, please refer to note 12, "senior notes and long-term debt" provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data." the corporation received $850.0 million of dividends and no dividends from the
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations bank in 2023 and 2022, respectively. dividends from the bank are subject to certain restrictions, as discussed in further detail in note 30, "restrictions on subsidiary dividends and loans or advances," provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
the corporation's liquidity, defined as the amount of cash and highly marketable assets, was $795.6 million and $601.4 million at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. during, and at year-end, 2023 and 2022, these assets were comprised almost entirely of cash in a demand deposit account at the bank or overnight money market placements, both of which were fully available to the corporation to support its own cash flow requirements or those of its subsidiaries, as needed. average liquidity during 2023 and 2022 was $797.2 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. the cash flows of the corporation are shown in note 33, "northern trust corporation (corporation only)," provided in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data."
uses of liquidity liquidity supports a variety of activities, including client withdrawals, purchases of securities, net loan growth, and draws on commitments to extend credit.
the corporation's uses of cash consist mainly of dividend payments to the corporation's stockholders; the payment of principal and interest to note holders; repurchases of its common stock; and investments in, or loans to, its subsidiaries. the most significant uses of cash by the corporation during 2023 were $621.5 million of common stock dividends and $347.5 million of common stock repurchases. the most significant uses of cash by the corporation during 2022 were $750.2 million of common stock dividends and $35.4 million of common stock repurchases.
credit ratings a significant source of liquidity for both the corporation and the bank is the ability to draw funding from capital markets globally. the credit ratings of the corporation and the bank as of december 31, 2023, provided in the following table, allow northern trust to access capital markets on favorable terms.

market risk there are two types of market risk, interest rate risk associated with the banking book and trading risk. interest rate risk associated with the banking book is the potential for movements in interest rates to cause changes in net interest income and the market value of equity, including accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) from the afs debt securities portfolio. trading risk is the potential for movements in market variables such as foreign exchange and interest rates to cause changes in the value of trading positions.
market risk framework and governance northern trust maintains a market risk framework consisting of risk management policies and practices to keep its risk profile within the board-approved corporate risk appetite statement. all market risk activities are overseen by the risk management function, which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities.
the asset and liability management policy, policy on dealer trading activities, and exposure limits for market risk are set by board-level committees, and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies, external regulations and established procedures. limits are monitored based on measures such as sensitivity of net interest income (nii), sensitivity of market value of equity (mve), and value-at-risk (var) across a range of time horizons.
treasury, in the first line of defense, proposes market risk management strategies and is responsible for performing market risk management activities. the alco provides first-line management oversight and is responsible for approving strategies and activities within the risk appetite, monitoring risk metrics, overseeing balance sheet resources, overseeing the execution of strategies, and reviewing reporting such as cash flows, the liquidity coverage ratio and stress test results.
the market and liquidity risk management function, in the second line of defense, provides challenge to the first-line activities, evaluates compliance with regulatory requirements and process effectiveness, and escalates material items for corrective action. the mlrc provides second-line oversight and is responsible for reviewing market risk exposures, establishing and monitoring risk metrics, and approving key methodologies and assumptions that drive market risk measurement.
interest rate risk overview interest rate risk in the banking book is the potential for deterioration in northern trust's financial position (e.g., interest income, market value of equity, or capital) due to changes in interest rates. nii and mve sensitivity are the primary metrics used for measurement and management of interest rate risk. changes in interest rates can have a positive or negative impact on nii depending on the positioning of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments. changes in interest rates also can impact the values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions, which directly impact the mve. higher interest rates may impact the fair value of available for sale debt securities which in turn affects accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) that can impact regulatory capital ratios. to mitigate interest rate risk, the structure of the balance sheet is managed so that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities (adjusted for hedges) are sufficiently correlated, which allows northern trust to manage its interest rate risk within its risk appetite.
there are four commonly recognized types of structural interest rate risk in the banking book:
•repricing risk, which arises from differences in the maturity and repricing terms of assets and liabilities;
•yield curve risk, which arises from changes in the shape of the yield curve;
•basis risk, which arises from imperfect correlation in the adjustment of the rates earned and paid on different financial instruments with otherwise similar repricing characteristics; and
•embedded optionality risk, which arises from client or counterparty behavior in response to interest rate changes.
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations interest rate risk analysis, monitoring, and reporting northern trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk: nii and mve sensitivity. nii sensitivity provides management with a short-term view of the impact of interest rate changes on nii. mve sensitivity provides management with a long-term view of interest rate changes on mve based on the period-end balance sheet.
northern trust limits aggregate interest rate risk (as measured by the nii sensitivity and mve sensitivity simulation techniques) to an acceptable level within the context of risk appetite. a variety of actions may be used to implement risk management strategies to modify interest rate risk including:
•purchase of investment securities;
•sale of investment securities that are classified as available for sale;
•issuance of senior notes and subordinated notes;
•collateralized borrowings from the federal home loan bank; and
•hedging with various types of derivative financial instruments.
nii sensitivity the modeling of nii sensitivity incorporates on-balance sheet positions, as well as derivative financial instruments (principally interest rate swaps) that are used to manage interest rate risk. northern trust uses market implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity (i.e., change) of a static balance sheet to changes in interest rates. stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates, nonparallel (i.e., twist) changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter, and changes to the relationship among the yield curves (i.e., basis risk).
the nii sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments. these assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior. the simulation cannot precisely estimate nii sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions. the following key assumptions are incorporated into the nii simulation:
•the balance sheet size and mix remains constant over the simulation horizon with maturing assets and liabilities replaced with instruments with similar terms as those that are maturing, with the exception of certain nonmaturity deposits that are considered short-term in nature and therefore receive a more conservative interest-bearing treatment;
•prepayments on mortgage loans and securities collateralized by mortgages are projected under each rate scenario using a third-party mortgage analytics system that incorporates market prepayment assumptions;
•cash flows for structured securities are estimated using a third-party vendor in conjunction with the prepayments provided by the third-party mortgage analytics vendor;
•nonmaturity deposit pricing is projected based on northern trust's actual historical patterns and management judgment, depending upon the availability of historical data and current pricing strategies/or judgment; and
•new business rates are based on current spreads to market indices.
the following table shows the estimated nii impact over the next twelve months of 100 and 200 basis point ramps upward and 100 and 200 basis point ramps downward movements in interest rates relative to forward rates as of december 31, 2023 and 2022. each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a one-year period.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mve sensitivity mve is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities, net of the value of financial derivatives that are used to manage the interest rate risk of balance sheet items. the mve looks at the whole balance sheet, which includes afs debt securities, htm debt securities, money market accounts, deposits, loans and wholesale borrowings. the potential effect of interest rate changes on mve is derived from the impact of such changes on projected future cash flows and the present value of these cash flows and is then compared to the established limit. northern trust uses current market rates (and the future rates implied by these market rates) as the base case and measures mve sensitivity under various rate scenarios. stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates, nonparallel (i.e., twist) changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter, and changes to the relationship among the yield curves (i.e., basis risk).
the mve sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments. these assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior. the simulation cannot precisely estimate mve sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions. many of the assumptions that apply to nii sensitivity also apply to mve sensitivity simulations, with the following separate key assumptions incorporated into the mve simulation:
•the present value of nonmaturity deposits are estimated using dynamic decay methodologies or estimated remaining lives, which are based on a combination of northern trust's actual historical runoff patterns and management judgment-some balances are assumed to be core and have longer lives while other balances are assumed to be temporary and have comparatively shorter lives;
•the present values of most noninterest-bearing balances (such as receivables, equipment, and payables) are the same as their book values; and
•monte carlo simulation is used to generate forward interest rate paths.
the following table shows the estimated impact on mve of 100 and 200 basis point shocks up and 100 and 200 basis point shocks down from current market implied forward rates at december 31, 2023 and 2022. each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a one-year period.

foreign currency market risk foreign currency non-trading risk overview northern trust's balance sheet is exposed to non-trading foreign currency risk as a result of its holdings of non-u.s.-dollar-denominated assets and liabilities, investment in non-u.s. subsidiaries, and future non-u.s.-dollar-denominated revenue and expense. to manage currency exposures on the balance sheet, northern trust attempts to match its assets and liabilities by currency. if those currency offsets do not exist on the balance sheet, northern trust will use foreign exchange derivative contracts to mitigate its currency exposure.
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations trading market risk within market risk, trading risk arises from providing foreign exchange, interest rate derivatives, and securities brokerage services to clients. securities positions are limited and their trading risks are de minimis. for regulatory capital purposes, trading risk also includes foreign currency balances from business operations.
trading book composition and risk drivers northern trust's trading book is composed of positions arising from activity in four business areas: global foreign exchange (gfx), which includes treasury foreign exchange trades; interest rate derivative (ird) trades; northern trust securities inc. (ntsi) inventory; and foreign currency balances (fcbs) accrued on the balance sheet.
gfx desks execute foreign exchange transactions for client accommodation purposes and mitigate most of the exposure via offsetting trades. in addition, northern trust's treasury department executes foreign exchange transactions to manage balance sheet flows. the risk system includes these within gfx and applies fx and interest rate (ir) drivers to produce var for regulatory capital.
northern trust's treasury department executes ird trades for client accommodation purposes and mitigates the exposure via offsetting trades. the risk system applies ir and volatility drivers to produce var for regulatory capital.
fcbs arise not from executing trades but rather in the course of regular business operations, from non-u.s.-dollar-denominated revenues and expenses accruing onto the corporation's balance sheet. prior to september 1, 2023, fx risk from these positions were mitigated through hedging activity. this hedging activity was discontinued on september 1, 2023. the risk system applies fx drivers to produce var for regulatory capital.
ntsi, a brokerage subsidiary of the corporation, executes fixed-income securities trades directly for client accounts. a small inventory of securities remains held in inventory overnight. this portfolio exposure is de minimis, and var calculations are not required. the valuation of the securities serves as the basis for calculating regulatory capital.
foreign currency trading risk overview foreign currency or foreign exchange trading positions exist when aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the u.s. dollar do not offset each other in amount, or offset each other over different time periods. the gfx trading portfolio at northern trust is composed of spot, forward, non-deliverable forward, and foreign exchange rate (fx) swap transactions.
for fcbs, the daily high, low, average, and quarter-end var values were all less than $1.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2023.
interest rate derivatives trading risk overview ird positions exist when aggregate interest cash inflows and outflows do not offset each other in amount or offset each other over different time periods. the ird trading portfolio at northern trust is composed mostly of interest rate swaps entered into to meet clients' interest rate risk management needs, but also including a small number of swaptions, caps, and floors. ird risk measures during the second quarter of 2023 became temporarily inflated as a result of transitions of ird contracts from libor to sofr referencing. the risk measures declined in the third quarter of 2023 as the bulk of transitions was completed. for the ird portfolio, the daily high, low, average, and as of december 31 var values were all less than $0.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2023.
other non-material trading activities northern trust's broker-dealer subsidiary, ntsi, maintains a portfolio of trading securities held for customer accommodation purposes and invests excess cash balances in short-term investment vehicles. the portfolio averaged $0.5 million and $12.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
trading book risk measurement for trading book activities other than ntsi, northern trust measures daily the risk of loss associated with all non-u.s. currency positions using a var model and applying the historical simulation methodology. this statistical model provides estimates, based on high confidence levels, of the potential loss in value that might be incurred if an adverse shift in interest rates and non-u.s. currency exchange rates were to occur over a small number of days. the model incorporates foreign currency and interest rate volatilities and correlations in price movements among the currencies and interest rates. var is computed for each trading desk and for the global portfolio.
var measures are computed daily in a vendor software application which reads positions from northern trust's trading systems and foreign currency balances from the general ledger. data vendors provide foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and volatilities for all currencies. the risk management function monitors on a daily basis var model inputs and outputs for reasonableness.
trading book risk monitoring, reporting and analysis northern trust monitors several variations of the var measures to meet specific regulatory and internal management needs. variations include different methodologies (historical simulation, monte carlo simulation and taylor
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations approximation), horizons of one day and ten days, confidence levels of 95% and 99%, subcomponent vars using only fx drivers, only ir drivers, and only volatility drivers, and look-back periods of one year, two years, and four years. those alternative measures provide management an array of corroborating metrics and alternative perspectives on northern trust's market risks.
automated daily reports are produced and distributed to business managers and risk managers. the risk management function also reviews and reports several variations of the var measures in historical time series format to provide management with a historical perspective on risk.
the following table presents the levels of total regulatory var and its subcomponents for gfx in the years indicated below, based on the historical simulation methodology, a 99% confidence level, a one-day horizon and equally-weighted volatility. the total var for gfx is typically less than the sum of its two subcomponents due to diversification benefits derived from the two subcomponents.

strategic risk strategic risk is the vulnerability of the organization to internal or external developments that render corporate strategy ineffective or unachievable. the consequences of strategic risk can be diminished long-term earnings and capital, as well as reputational damage to the firm. strategic risk encompasses two main areas:
•macroeconomic and geopolitical risk centers on external events or developments that would have a detrimental impact on financial markets and/or financial services firms.
•business risk arises from internal, secular, competitive, or regulatory trends that impact northern trust's stated strategy or its achievability.
strategic risk framework and governance the corporate strategic risk framework has been developed in conjunction with the corporation's risk appetite and risk management policies, and defines the mission and expectations of the strategic risk management function to identify and analyze the sources and consequences of strategic risk.
this is achieved through participation in the establishment and review of business line strategy, coordination of risk input to the evaluation of key strategic opportunities, and developing and maintaining a risk inventory and set of metrics which attempt to gauge the level of strategic risk within the organization.
in addition, the strategic risk management function maintains the global event response program, which aims to anticipate and prepare for stress scenarios, and provide an outline for responding to them when they occur.
both gerc and the business risk committee are responsible for reviewing the general methods, guidelines and frameworks by which northern trust monitors and evaluates strategic risk.
climate risk climate risk continues to be an evolving strategic risk for the corporation. climate risk refers to the risk of loss arising from climate change and is comprised of physical risk, liability risk and transition risk. physical risk refers to risks to banks and the financial system emanating from the increased severity of extreme weather events (e.g., cyclones, droughts, floods, and fires). it can also refer to longer-term shifts in precipitation and temperature and increased variability in weather patterns (e.g., sea level rise). liability risk stems from the potential for litigation where institutions and boards do not adequately consider or respond to the impacts of climate change. transition risk reflects the risks to banks and financial systems of transitioning to a lower-carbon economy that may entail extensive policy, legal, technological, and market changes. depending on the nature, speed, and focus of these changes, transition risks may pose varying levels of financial and reputational risk to banks and the financial system.
effective management of climate risk requires coordinated governance, clearly defined roles and responsibilities and well-developed processes to identify, measure, monitor and control risks. we continue to build out and enhance our climate risk management capabilities. our climate risk management efforts are overseen by the chief climate and sustainability
2023 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk officer who reports directly to the cro. the risk management function has created a dedicated climate and sustainability risk unit to monitor, oversee and take account of the increasing impact that climate change has, or may in the future have, on financial risk, nonfinancial risk, and regulatory compliance across the globe. the climate and sustainability risk unit works to evolve the risk management framework to ensure the corporation meets the expectations of all stakeholders as well as all climate-related commitments made by the corporation to external agencies.
the board of directors, and in particular its corporate governance committee, engages in active oversight of esg matters of significance to the corporation and its subsidiaries. in addition, the business risk committee provides oversight of certain financial and operational risks associated with climate change and other environmental factors through its oversight of the corporation's global risk management framework and risk management policies. the business risk committee also engages in periodic discussions with management and members of the risk management function regarding strategic risks, including climate-related risk.
the corporation expects that climate change will increasingly impact the risk types it manages, and the corporation will continue to integrate climate considerations into its risk management framework as its understanding of climate change and risks driven by it evolve. various regulatory agencies, investors, and other stakeholders have increased expectations and scrutiny in this area. the corporation is committed to helping mitigate the impacts of climate change related to its activities and to partner with key stakeholders to do the same.

2023 annual report | northern trust corporation management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations supplemental information reconciliation to fully taxable equivalent the following table presents a reconciliation of interest income, net interest income, net interest margin, and total revenue prepared in accordance with gaap to such measures on an fte basis, which are non-gaap financial measures. net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income by average interest-earning assets. management believes this presentation provides a clearer indication of these financial measures for comparative purposes. when adjusted to an fte basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an fte basis has no impact on net income.

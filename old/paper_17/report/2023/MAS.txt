item 1a. risk factors.
there are a number of business risks and uncertainties that could impact our business. these risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ from past performance or expected results. we consider the following risks and uncertainties to be most relevant to our specific business activities. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently believe to be immaterial, also may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial position.
strategic risks our business strategy is focused on residential repair and remodeling activity and, to a lesser extent, on new home construction activity, both of which are impacted by a number of economic and other factors.
our business performance relies on residential repair and remodeling activity and, to a lesser extent, on new home construction activity. a number of factors impact consumers' spending on home improvement projects as well as new home construction activity, including:
•consumer confidence levels;
•consumer income and debt levels;
•unemployment and underemployment levels;
•the availability of home equity loans and mortgages and the interest rates for and tax deductibility of such loans;
•inflationary pressures;
•changing government policies and programs;
•existing home sales;
•age of the housing stock;
•fluctuations in home prices;
•household formation;
•trends in lifestyle and housing design;
•the availability of skilled tradespeople for repair and remodeling work; and
•natural disasters, terrorist acts, pandemics, wars or conflicts or other catastrophic events.
we have been and may in the future be negatively impacted by adverse changes or uncertainty involving one or more of the factors listed above. in addition, the fundamentals driving our business are impacted by economic cycles. economic contractions or recessions have resulted in and could in the future result in a decline in residential repair and remodeling activity or in demand for new home construction, adversely impacting our results of operations and financial position.
we may not achieve all of the anticipated benefits of our strategic initiatives.
we continue to pursue our strategy of driving the full potential of our core businesses, leveraging opportunities across our enterprise, and actively managing our portfolio. our strategy is designed to grow revenue, improve profitability and increase shareholder value over the mid- to long-term. we execute our strategy by investing in our brands, developing innovative products, making capital investments, and focusing on continuous productivity improvement and operational excellence, among other initiatives. our business performance and results of operations could be adversely impacted if we are unable to timely and effectively execute our strategy. we could also be adversely impacted if we have not appropriately prioritized and balanced our strategic initiatives or if we are unable to effectively manage change throughout our organization.
we may not be able to successfully execute our acquisition strategy or integrate businesses that we acquire.
pursuing the acquisition of businesses complementary to our portfolio is a component of our strategy for future growth. if we are not able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate potential acquisitions within a desired time frame or at acceptable terms and prices, our long-term competitive positioning may be impacted. even if we are successful in acquiring businesses, the businesses we acquire may not be able to achieve the revenue, profitability or growth we anticipate, or we may experience challenges and risks in integrating these businesses into our existing business. such risks include:
•difficulties in retaining critical employees of the acquired businesses;
•difficulties realizing expected synergies and economies of scale;
•diversion of management attention and our resources;
•issues or conflicts with our new or existing customers or suppliers; and
•unforeseen liabilities.
international acquisitions that we have made, and those that we may make in the future, may continue to increase our exposure to foreign currency risks, and risks associated with interpretation and enforcement of international regulations and the policies of other governments. our failure to address these risks could cause us to incur additional costs and fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions and could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.
business and operational risks variability in the cost and availability of our raw materials, component parts and finished products could impact our results of operations and financial position.
we purchase substantial amounts of raw materials, component parts and finished products from outside sources, including international sources, and we manufacture certain of our products outside of the united states. increases in the cost of the materials we purchase, including as a result of diminished availability, increased tariffs and inflation or unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates have increased and may in the future increase the prices for our products and negatively impact our results of operations and financial position. further, our production has been and may in the future be impacted if we or our suppliers are unable to procure our requirements for various commodities, including, among others, brass, resins, titanium dioxide and zinc, or if a shortage of these commodities results in significantly increased costs. energy prices have also increased and, this coupled with potential energy supply shortages, has resulted in increased production and transportation costs, which may continue in the future. in addition, water is a significant component of our architectural coatings products and may be subject to shortages and restrictions on supply in certain regions, due to climate-related and other influences. these factors could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.
it can be difficult for us to pass our cost increases on to our customers. our existing arrangements with customers, competitive considerations and customer resistance to price increases may delay or make us unable to adjust selling prices. if we are not able to sufficiently increase the prices of our products or achieve cost savings to offset increased material, production, transportation and labor costs, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely impacted. increased selling prices for our products have led and may in the future lead to sales declines and loss of market share, particularly if those prices are not competitive. when our material costs decline, we have received and may in the future receive pressure from our customers to reduce our prices. such reductions have had and could in the future have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.
from time to time we enter into long-term agreements with certain significant suppliers to help ensure continued availability of the commodities we require to produce our products and to establish firm pricing, but these contractual commitments may result in our paying above market prices for commodities during the term of the contract. occasionally, we may also use derivative instruments, including commodity futures and swaps. this strategy increases the possibility that we may make commitments for these commodities at prices that subsequently exceed their market prices, which has occurred and could occur in the future has had and may in the future have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.
we are dependent on suppliers and service providers.
we are dependent on third parties for our raw materials, many of our components and finished products and for certain services. our ability to offer a wide variety of products and provide high levels of service to our customers depends on whether we can obtain an adequate and timely supply of these goods and services. failure of our suppliers to timely provide us goods and services on commercially reasonable terms or to comply with applicable contractual, legal and regulatory requirements or our supplier business practices policy could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position or could damage our reputation.
the operations of the third parties on which we depend have been and could in the future be impacted by: changing laws, regulations and policies, including those related to climate change; cybersecurity breaches; labor availability; raw material shortages; energy availability; supply disruptions; and adverse weather conditions, pandemics, wars or conflicts and other force majeure events. any of these factors could disrupt our third parties' operations and result in shortages of supply, assertion of force majeure and increases in the prices charged to us for the raw materials, components and finished products they produce or services they provide. sourcing these goods and services from alternate suppliers, including suppliers from new geographic regions, or re-engineering our products as a result of supplier disruptions, can be time-consuming and costly and could result in inefficiencies or delays in our business operations or could negatively impact the quality of our products. in addition, the loss of critical suppliers, or a substantial decrease in the availability of supply, has disrupted and could in the future disrupt our business and has had and may in the future have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.
many of the suppliers we rely upon are located in countries outside of the united states. the differences in business practices, shipping and delivery requirements and costs, changes in economic conditions and trade policies and laws and regulations, together with the limited number of suppliers available to us, have increased the complexity of our supply chain logistics and the potential for interruptions in our production scheduling. we have experienced and may in the future experience constraints on and disruptions to transporting our raw materials, components and finished products from our international and domestic suppliers as well as higher transportation costs. if we are unable to effectively manage our supply chain our results of operations and financial position could be adversely impacted.
there are risks associated with our international operations and global strategies.
in 2023, 20 percent of our sales were made outside of north america (particularly in europe) and transacted in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. in addition to our european operations, we manufacture products in other locations, including asia and mexico and source products and components from third parties globally. risks associated with our international operations include:
•differences in culture, economic and labor conditions and practices;
•differences in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights;
•differences in the policies of the u.s. and foreign governments;
•disruptions in trade relations and economic instability;
•natural disasters, terrorist attacks, pandemics, wars or conflicts or other catastrophic events;
•social and political unrest; and
•timeliness of transportation and port congestion.
we have been and may in the future be negatively impacted by adverse changes or uncertainty involving one or more of the factors listed above.
we are also affected by domestic and international laws and regulations applicable to companies doing business outside of the u.s., or importing and exporting goods and materials. these include anti-bribery/anti-corruption laws, laws regulating competition, sanctions, tax laws, trade regulations, including duties and tariffs, and other business practices. compliance with these laws is costly, and future changes to these laws may require significant management attention and disrupt our operations. additionally, while it is difficult to assess what changes may occur and the relative effect on our international tax structure, significant changes in how u.s. and international jurisdictions tax cross-border transactions could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.
our results of operations and financial position are also impacted by changes in currency exchange rates. unfavorable currency exchange rates, particularly the euro, the chinese renminbi, the canadian dollar, the british pound sterling and the mexican peso, have in the past adversely impacted us, and could adversely impact us in the future. fluctuations in currency exchange rates may also present challenges in comparing our operating performance from period to period.
the long-term performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract, develop and retain a talented and diverse workforce.
for our businesses to be successful, we must invest significant resources to attract, develop and retain highly qualified, talented and diverse employees, who have the experience, knowledge and expertise to implement our strategic and business initiatives. we compete for employees with a broad range of employers in many different industries, including large multinational firms. we have faced and may continue to face challenges in recruiting, developing, motivating and retaining employees, particularly when the labor market is experiencing low unemployment levels, increasing compensation and increasing competition.
if we are unable to successfully implement our talent strategies, including attracting, developing and retaining key employees, building strong and diverse leadership teams, developing effective succession planning and successfully executing organizational change and leadership transition, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely impacted.
extreme weather events and changes in climate could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.
extreme weather events, such as severe winter and other storms, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornados and droughts, as a result of climate change or other factors, have negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact our business. these types of events can be disruptive to our operations and may impact consumer spending. in addition, some of our suppliers are located in areas that have experienced extreme weather events which have impacted and may in the future impact the availability and cost of some of our raw materials, components and finished products. if the frequency or severity of extreme weather increases, we may experience interruptions to our operations, further impact on our supply chain, increased operating costs or loss or damage to our property or inventory, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.
restrictive covenants in our credit agreement could limit our financial flexibility.
we must comply with both financial and nonfinancial covenants in our credit agreement, and in order to borrow under it, we cannot be in default with any of those provisions. our ability to borrow under the credit agreement could be affected if our earnings significantly decline to a level where we are not in compliance with the financial covenants or if we default on any nonfinancial covenants. in the past, we have been able to amend the covenants in our credit agreement, but there can be no assurance that in the future we would be able to further amend them. if we were unable to borrow under our credit agreement, our financial flexibility could be restricted.
competitive risks we could lose market share if we do not maintain our strong brands, develop innovative products or respond to changing consumer purchasing practices and preferences.
our competitive advantage is due, in part, to our ability to maintain our strong brands and to develop and introduce innovative new and improved products. our initiatives to invest in brand building, brand awareness and product innovation may not be successful. the uncertainties associated with developing and introducing innovative and improved products, such as gauging changing consumer demands and preferences and successfully developing, manufacturing, marketing, selling and servicing these products, may impact the success of our product introductions. if the products we introduce do not gain widespread acceptance or if our competitors improve their products more rapidly or effectively than we do, we could lose market share or be required to reduce our prices, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.
in recent years, consumer purchasing practices and preferences have shifted and our customers' business models and strategies have changed. as our customers execute their strategies to reach end consumers through multiple channels, they rely on us to support their efforts with our infrastructure, including maintaining robust and user-friendly websites with sufficient content for consumer research and providing comprehensive supply chain solutions and differentiated product development. if we are unable to successfully provide this support to our customers or if our customers are unable to successfully execute their strategies, our brands may lose market share, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.
consumer preferences are also changing, including a continued shift in consumer purchasing practices toward e-commerce and a potential increase in consumer demand for products with certain attributes, such as connected products and sustainable products. if we do not timely and effectively identify and respond to these changes our relationships with our customers and with consumers could be harmed, our ability to retain our customers and consumers may be negatively impacted, the demand for our brands and products could be reduced and our results of operations and financial position could be adversely impacted.
damage to our public image and reputation could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.
our public image and reputation are important to maintaining our strong brands. our results of operations and financial position could be adversely impacted by a negative perception regarding our products or company practices, positions or public statements, even if unfounded, negative claims and comments in social media or the press or a data breach.
furthermore, stakeholders are increasingly scrutinizing companies' environmental, social and governance ("esg") practices, and stakeholders' expectations regarding esg practices are diverse and rapidly changing. we may not be able to align our esg practices with such evolving expectations within the timeframes expected by stakeholders or without incurring significant costs. in addition, we may not be able to achieve our aspirational goals related to our esg initiatives, which are and may continue to be impacted by many complexities and variables, such as renewable energy infrastructure and availability, changes to the labor market, a challenging economic environment, changes to our operations, changes to our portfolio of businesses via acquisitions or divestitures, and adjustments to our job levels and managerial headcount. a failure or perceived failure by us in this regard may damage our reputation and adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.
we face significant competition and operate in an evolving competitive landscape.
our products face significant competition. we believe that brand reputation is an important factor affecting product selection and that we compete on the basis of product features, innovation, quality, customer service, warranty and price. we sell our products through home center retailers, online retailers, distributors and independent dealers and rely on these customers to market and promote our products to consumers. our success with our customers is dependent on, among other things, our ability to provide quality products with desired features at acceptable prices with timely delivery and a high level of customer service. home center retailers, which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and remodelers, are increasingly selling directly to professional contractors and installers, which may adversely impact our margins on our products that contractors and installers would otherwise buy through our dealers and wholesalers. in addition, as home center retailers develop customer experience programs to attract and retain contractors and installers, they are relying on us to support their efforts. such support has been and could continue to be time-consuming and costly and these efforts may not be successful, which may impact our growth, results of operations and financial position.
certain of our customers sell products sourced from low-cost foreign manufacturers under their own private label brands, which directly compete with our brands. as a result of this trend, we have experienced and may in the future experience lower demand for our products or a shift in the mix of some products we sell toward more value-priced or opening price point products, which has impacted and may in the future impact our results of operations and financial position.
in addition, we face competitive pricing pressure in the marketplace, including sales promotion programs, that could impact our market share or result in price reductions, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.
the growing e-commerce channel brings an increased number of competitors and greater pricing transparency for consumers, as well as conflicts between our existing distribution channels and a need for different distribution methods. these factors have impacted and could in the future impact our results of operations and financial position. in addition, our relationships with our customers, including our home center customers, may be impacted if we increase the amount of business we transact in the e-commerce channel.
if we are unable to maintain our competitive position in our industries, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely impacted.
our sales are concentrated with three significant customers and this concentration may continue to increase. in 2023, our net sales to the home depot were $3.1 billion (approximately 39 percent of our consolidated net sales), and our net sales to ferguson and lowe's were each less than 10 percent of our consolidated net sales. these customers can significantly impact the prices we receive for our products and the terms and conditions on which we do business with them. additionally, these customers have reduced in the past and may in the future reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase and could make significant changes in their volume of purchases from us. although other retailers, dealers, distributors and homebuilders represent other channels of distribution for our products and services, we might not be able to quickly replace, or replace at all, the loss of a substantial portion of our sales to the home depot or the loss of all of our sales to either ferguson or lowe's. any such loss would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial position.
in addition, our behr business grants behr brand exclusivity in the retail sales channel in north america to the home depot, and from time to time, certain of our other businesses grant product and/or brand exclusivity to our customers. the granting of exclusivity impacts our ability to sell those products and brands to other customers and can increase the complexity of our product offerings and our costs.
technology and intellectual property risks we are subject to cybersecurity attacks, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.
global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats and more frequent, sophisticated and targeted attacks pose a risk to our information technology systems and to critical third-party information technology platforms we utilize. we have implemented security policies, processes and layers of defense designed to help identify and protect against misappropriation or corruption of our systems and information and disruption of our operations. despite these efforts, systems we utilize have been and may in the future be damaged, disrupted, ransomed or shut down due to cybersecurity attacks by unauthorized access, malware, ransomware, undetected intrusion, hardware failures, or other events, and in these circumstances our disaster recovery plans may be ineffective or inadequate.
these attacks could have the following impacts on our business, some of which we have experienced:
•business interruption;
•damage to our relationships with our employees, suppliers, customers and consumers;
•damage to the reputation of our brands;
•data corruption;
•exposure or loss of proprietary confidential or financial information or the personal information of our employees, suppliers, customers or consumers;
•exposure to litigation;
•inability to report our financial results in a timely manner;
•increased costs associated with the remediation and mitigation of such attacks;
•product shipment delays;
•production or operational downtime; and
•theft of our assets.
in addition, we could be adversely impacted if any of our significant customers, suppliers or service providers experiences any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation. such events could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.
we rely on information systems and technology, and a breakdown or interruption of these systems could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.
we rely on many on-site and cloud-based information systems and technology to process, transmit, store and manage information to support our business activities. we may be adversely impacted if these information systems breakdown, fail, or are no longer supported by third-party service providers, including cloud platform providers.
in addition to the consequences that may occur from interruptions in the current systems we utilize, we continue to invest in new technology systems throughout our company, including implementations of and upgrades to critical systems at our business units. system implementations and upgrades are complex and require significant management oversight, and we have experienced, and in the future experience, unanticipated expenses and interruptions to our operations during these implementations and upgrades. our results of operations and financial position, as well as the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, could be adversely impacted if we do not appropriately select, implement, maintain or upgrade our critical systems in a timely manner or if we experience significant unanticipated expenses or disruptions in connection with the implementation, upgrade or update of such systems.
we may not be able to adequately protect or prevent the unauthorized use of our intellectual property.
protecting our intellectual property is important to our growth and innovation efforts. we own a number of patents, trade names, brand names and other forms of intellectual property in our products and manufacturing processes throughout the world. there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights will prevent violations. our intellectual property has been and may again be challenged or infringed upon by third parties, particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected. in addition, the global nature of our business increases the risk that we may be unable to obtain or maintain our intellectual property rights on reasonable terms. furthermore, others have asserted and may in the future assert intellectual property infringement claims against us. current and former employees, contractors, customers or suppliers have or may have had access to proprietary or confidential information regarding our business operations that could harm us if used by them, or disclosed to others, including our competitors. protecting and preventing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is costly, time consuming and require significant resources. if we are not able to protect our existing intellectual property rights, or prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property, sales of our products may be impacted and we may experience reputational damage to our brand names, increased litigation costs and adverse impact to our competitive position, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.
litigation and regulatory risks claims and litigation could be costly.
we are involved in various claims and litigation, including class actions, mass torts and regulatory proceedings, that arise in the ordinary course of our business and that could have an adverse impact on us. the types of matters may include, among others: advertising, competition, contract, data privacy, employment, environmental, insurance coverage, intellectual property, personal injury, product compliance, product liability, securities and warranty. the outcome and effect of these matters are inherently unpredictable, and defending and resolving them can be costly and can divert management's attention. we have and may in the future incur significant costs as a result of claims and litigation.
we are also subject to product safety regulations, product recalls and direct claims for product liability that can result in significant costs and, regardless of the ultimate outcome, create adverse publicity and damage the reputation of our brands and business. also, we rely on suppliers to provide finished products and components for products that we sell. due to the difficulty of controlling the quality of finished products and components we source from these suppliers, we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such finished products and components and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers.
we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks of loss resulting from claims and litigation. the levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover our losses or liabilities. if any significant accident, judgment, claim or other event is not fully insured or indemnified against, it could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.
refer to note t to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information about litigation involving our businesses.
our failure to comply with laws, government regulations and other requirements could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.
we are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including those pertaining to:
•anti-bribery/anti-corruption;
•climate change and protection of the environment;
•competition practices;
•data privacy;
•employment and labor matters;
•environment, health and safety matters;
•product safety and performance;
•protection of employees and consumers;
•securities matters;
•sanctions;
•taxation;
•trade, including duties and tariffs; and
•wage and hour matters.
in addition to complying with current requirements and known future requirements, we will be subject to new or more stringent requirements in the future.
as we sell new types of products or existing products in new geographies or channels or for new applications, we are subject to the requirements applicable to those sales. additionally, some of our products must be certified by industry organizations. compliance with new or changed laws, regulations and other requirements, including as a part of government or industry response to climate change, may require us to alter our product designs, our manufacturing processes, our packaging or our sourcing or may result in restrictions on our operations. these compliance activities are costly and require significant management attention and resources. if we do not effectively and timely comply with such regulations and other requirements, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely impacted.
item 7.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, our consolidated financial statements (and notes related thereto) and other more detailed financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. further, you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the "risk factors" included elsewhere in this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. see also "cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements" at the beginning of this report. amounts may not add due to rounding.
overview we design, manufacture and distribute branded home improvement and building products. these products are sold primarily for repair and remodeling activity and, to a lesser extent, new home construction. we sell our products through home center retailers, online retailers, wholesalers and distributors, mass merchandisers, hardware stores, direct to the consumer, professional contractors and homebuilders.
we continue to pursue our strategy of driving the full potential of our core businesses, leveraging opportunities across our enterprise, and actively managing our portfolio. we remain confident in the fundamentals of our business and long-term strategy. we execute our strategy by investing in our brands, developing innovative products, making capital investments, and focusing on continuous productivity improvement and operational excellence, among other initiatives. we believe that our strong financial position and cash flow generation, together with our investments in our industry-leading branded building products, our continued focus on innovation and disciplined capital allocation, will allow us to drive long-term growth and create value for our shareholders.
we continue to leverage the masco operating system, our approach to drive growth and productivity, and continuous improvement initiatives across our enterprise to identify additional opportunities to improve our business operations. from time to time, we may take actions to drive efficiency in the business focused on the strategic rationalization of our businesses, including business consolidations, plant closures, headcount reductions and other cost savings initiatives.
recent trends due to changing market conditions, we are experiencing, and may continue to experience, lower market demand for our products. we have been experiencing, and may continue to experience, elevated commodity and other input costs, as well as employee-related cost inflation. while still elevated, we have recently seen some reduction of certain costs, and we aim to offset the potential unfavorable impact of our costs and lower demand for our products with productivity improvement, pricing, and other initiatives.
consolidated results of operations we report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"). however, we believe that certain non-gaap performance measures and ratios, used in managing the business, may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods. these include the disclosure of net sales, operating profit and operating profit margins adjusted for certain items. non-gaap performance measures and ratios should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results under gaap.
we discuss our consolidated results as well as our business segment and geographic area results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2023 versus december 31, 2022. a detailed discussion of our consolidated, business segment and geographic area results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 can be found under "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in part ii of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, which was filed with the sec on february 9, 2023.

our net sales for 2023 were $7,967 million, which decreased eight percent compared to 2022. excluding acquisitions and the effect of currency translation, net sales decreased eight percent.
our net sales for 2023 decreased primarily due to:
•                 lower sales volume across the entire company which decreased sales by 11 percent.
•                 unfavorable sales mix of plumbing products which decreased sales by one percent.
these amounts were partially offset by:
•                 higher net selling prices across the entire company which increased sales by three percent.

•                 higher net selling prices.
•                 cost savings initiatives.
•                 lower transportation costs.
•                 receipt of an insurance settlement payment.
•                 lower excess and obsolete inventory charges.
these amounts were partially offset by:
•                 lower sales volume.
•                 unfavorable sales mix.

liquidity and capital resources overview of capital structure historically, we have largely funded our growth through cash provided by our operations, the issuance of notes in the financial markets, bank borrowings and, to a lesser extent, the issuance of our common stock, including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions. maintaining high levels of liquidity and focusing on cash generation are among our financial strategies. our capital allocation strategy includes reinvesting in our business, maintaining an investment grade credit rating, maintaining a relevant dividend and deploying excess free cash flow to share repurchases or acquisitions.
we had cash and cash investments of approximately $634 million and $452 million at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. our cash and cash investments consist of overnight interest bearing money market demand accounts, time deposit accounts, and money market mutual funds containing government securities and treasury obligations. while we attempt to diversify these investments in a prudent manner to minimize risk, it is possible that future changes in the financial markets could affect the security or availability of these investments. of the cash and cash investments we held at december 31, 2023 and 2022, $323 million and $321 million, respectively, was held in our foreign subsidiaries. if these funds were needed for our operations in the u.s., their repatriation into the u.s. would not result in significant additional u.s. income tax or foreign withholding tax, as we have recorded such taxes on substantially all undistributed foreign earnings, except for those that are legally restricted.
our current ratio was 1.7 to 1 and 1.6 to 1 at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the increase in our current ratio is primarily due to the repayment of the 364-day term loan during 2023.
our total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 97 percent and 109 percent at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. refer to note k to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
we believe that our present cash balance and cash flows from operations, and borrowing availability under our revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to fund our near-term working capital and other investment needs. we believe that our longer-term working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from bank borrowings and future financial market activities. however, due to the changing market conditions and its impact on our customers and suppliers, we are unable to fully estimate the extent of the impact that the changing market conditions may have on our future financial condition.
capital expenditures we continue to invest in our manufacturing and distribution operations to increase our productivity, improve customer service and support product innovation. capital expenditures for 2023 were $243 million, compared with $224 million for 2022. the increase in capital expenditures in 2023 was primarily due to capacity expansion plans in our plumbing products and decorative architectural products segments. for 2024, capital expenditures, excluding any potential future acquisitions, are expected to be approximately $200 million. depreciation and amortization expense for 2023 totaled $149 million, compared with $145 million for 2022. for 2024, depreciation and amortization expense, excluding any potential future acquisitions, is expected to be approximately $160 million. amortization expense totaled $34 million in 2023, compared with $33 million in 2022.
credit agreement on april 26, 2022, we entered into a revolving credit agreement (the "2022 credit agreement") with an aggregate commitment of $1.0 billion and a maturity date of april 26, 2027.
under the 2022 credit agreement, at our request and subject to certain conditions, we can increase the aggregate commitment up to an additional $500 million with the current lenders or new lenders. see note k to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the 2022 credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain (a) a net leverage ratio, as adjusted for certain items, not exceeding 4.0 to 1.0, and (b) an interest coverage ratio, as adjusted for certain items, not less than 2.5 to 1.0. we were in compliance with all covenants and no borrowings were outstanding under our 2022 credit agreement as of december 31, 2023.
short-term borrowings on may 9, 2023, our hansgrohe se subsidiary entered into €70 million ($77 million) of short-term borrowings to support working capital needs. the loans contained no financial covenants and the entire balance was repaid as of december 31, 2023.
364-day term loan on april 26, 2022, we entered into a 364-day $500 million senior unsecured delayed draw term loan (the "term loan") due april 26, 2023 with a syndicate of lenders. the term loan and commitments thereunder were subject to prepayment or termination at our option and the loans bore interest at sofr plus a spread adjustment and 0.70%. the covenants, including the financial covenants, were substantially the same as those in the 2022 credit agreement. we repaid $300 million during 2022 and the remaining $200 million upon the maturity of the term loan on april 26, 2023.
corporate development strategy we expect to maintain a balanced growth strategy pursuing organic growth by maximizing the full potential of our existing businesses and, as appropriate, complementing our existing business with strategic acquisitions.
in addition, we actively manage our portfolio of companies by divesting those businesses that do not align with our long-term growth strategy. we will continue to review all of our businesses to determine which businesses, if any, may not align with our long-term growth strategy.
acquisitions in the third quarter of 2023, we acquired all of the share capital of sauna360 for approximately €124 million ($136 million), net of cash acquired. sauna360 has a portfolio of products that includes traditional, infrared, and wood-burning saunas as well as steam showers.
share repurchases effective october 20, 2022, our board of directors authorized the repurchase, for retirement, of up to $2.0 billion of shares of our common stock, exclusive of excise tax, in open-market transactions or otherwise. we repurchased and retired 6.2 million shares of our common stock in 2023 for approximately $356 million, inclusive of excise tax of $3 million. this included 0.2 million shares to offset the dilutive impact of restricted stock units granted in 2023. at december 31, 2023, we had $1.6 billion remaining under the 2022 authorization. consistent with past practice and as part of our long-term capital allocation strategy, outside of any potential acquisitions, we anticipate using approximately $600 million of cash for share repurchases (including shares which will be purchased to offset any dilution from restricted stock units granted as part of our compensation programs) in 2024. refer to note n to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
during 2022, we repurchased and retired 16.6 million shares of our common stock (including 0.6 million shares to offset the dilutive impact of restricted stock units granted during the year), for approximately $914 million.
dividend to holders of our common shares we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.285 per common share for an annual dividend of $1.14 per share.
as part of our capital allocation strategy, the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.29 per share in the first quarter of 2024 with the intention to increase the annual dividend 2 percent to $1.16 per share.
other liquidity and capital resource activities as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our cash flow and related liquidity, we work with suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, including extending payment terms. we also facilitate a voluntary supply chain finance program (the "program") to provide certain of our suppliers with the opportunity to sell receivables due from us to participating financial institutions at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the financial institutions. the amounts confirmed as valid under the program and included in accounts payable were $53 million and $50 million at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. of the amounts confirmed as valid under the program, the amounts owed to participating financial institutions were $28 million and $29 million at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. all payments made under the program are recorded as a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, net, in our consolidated statements of cash flows. a downgrade in our credit rating or changes in the financial markets could limit the financial institutions' willingness to commit funds to, and participate in, the program. we do not believe such risk would have a material impact on our working capital or cash flows, as substantially all of our payments are made outside of the program.
we utilize derivative and hedging instruments to manage our exposure to currency fluctuations, primarily related to the european euro, british pound sterling, the chinese renminbi and the u.s. dollar; occasionally, we have also used derivative and hedging instruments to manage interest rate fluctuations, primarily related to debt issuances. we review our hedging program, derivative positions and overall risk management on a regular basis. we currently do not have any derivative instruments for which we have designated hedge accounting.

operating activities net cash provided by operations was $1,413 million, primarily driven by operating profit and changes in working capital, mostly attributable to lower inventory.
financing activities net cash used for financing activities was $854 million, primarily due to $353 million for the repurchase and retirement of our common stock (including 0.2 million shares repurchased to offset the dilutive impact of restricted stock units granted in 2023), $257 million for the payment of cash dividends, $200 million for the repayment of the 364-day term loan, $49 million for dividends paid to noncontrolling interest and $29 million for employee withholding taxes paid on stock-based compensation. these uses of cash were partially offset by $38 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
investing activities net cash used for investing activities was $383 million, primarily driven by $243 million of capital expenditures and $136 million for the acquisition of sauna360.
commitments and contingencies litigation information regarding our legal proceedings is set forth in note t to the consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.
other commitments we enter into contracts, which include reasonable and customary indemnifications that are standard for the industries in which we operate. such indemnifications include claims made against builders by homeowners for issues relating to our products and workmanship. in conjunction with divestitures and other transactions, we occasionally provide reasonable and customary indemnifications. we have not paid a material amount related to these indemnifications, and we evaluate the probability that amounts may be incurred and record an estimated liability when probable and reasonably estimable.

(a)we assume that all debt would be held to maturity. amounts include finance lease obligations.
(b)excludes contracts that do not require volume commitments and open or pending purchase orders.
(c)due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with uncertain tax positions, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate for the year in which cash settlements may occur with applicable tax authorities.

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect or could have affected the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. we regularly review our estimates and assumptions, which are based upon historical experience, as well as current economic conditions and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities and related disclosures, and future revenues and expenses, that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
note a to the consolidated financial statements includes our accounting policies, estimates and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
we believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we recognize revenue as control of our products is transferred to our customers, which is generally at the time of shipment or upon delivery based on the contractual terms with our customers. we provide customer programs and incentive offerings, including special pricing and co-operative advertising arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives. these customer programs and incentives are considered variable consideration. we include in revenue variable consideration only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the variable consideration is resolved. this determination is made based upon known customer program and incentive offerings at the time of sale, and expected sales volume forecasts as it relates to our volume-based incentives. this determination is updated each reporting period.
goodwill and other intangible assets we record the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets. in the fourth quarter of each year, or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, we complete the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method. we selected the discounted cash flow methodology because we believe that it is comparable to what would be used by market participants. we have defined our reporting units and completed the impairment testing of goodwill at the operating segment level.
determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, including long-term projections of cash flows, market conditions and appropriate discount rates. our judgments are based upon historical experience, current market trends, consultations with external valuation specialists and other information. while we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable, different estimates and assumptions could result in different outcomes. in estimating future cash flows, we rely on internally generated five-year forecasts for sales and operating profits, and, currently, a two percent to three percent long-term assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the five-year forecast. we generally develop these forecasts based upon, among other things, recent sales data for existing products, planned timing of new product launches, estimated repair and remodel activity and, to a lesser extent, estimated housing starts. our assumptions included u.s. and eurozone gross domestic product both growing at approximately 1.0 percent in 2024, and 2.0 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively, per annum over the remainder of the five-year forecast.
we utilize our weighted average cost of capital of approximately 9.50 percent as the basis to determine the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows. in 2023, based upon our assessment of the risks impacting each of our businesses, we applied a risk premium to increase the discount rate to a range of 11.50 percent to 13.50 percent for our reporting units.
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting unit's recorded carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit.
in the fourth quarter of 2023, we estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for all of our reporting units were greater than the carrying values. accordingly, we did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill. a 10 percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units would not have resulted in any goodwill impairment.
we review our other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the business unit. potential impairment is identified by comparing the fair value of an other indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying value. we utilize a relief-from-royalty model to estimate the fair value of other indefinite-lived intangible assets. we consider the implications of both external (e.g., market growth, competition and local economic conditions) and internal (e.g., product sales and expected product growth) factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near- and long-term. we also consider the profitability of the business, among other factors, to determine the royalty rate for use in the impairment assessment.
we utilize our weighted average cost of capital of approximately 9.50 percent as the basis to determine the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows. in 2023, based upon our assessment of the risks impacting each of our businesses and the nature of the other indefinite-lived intangible assets (i.e., trade name), we applied a risk premium to increase the discount rate to a range of 12.25 percent to 14.50 percent for our other indefinite-lived intangible assets.
if the carrying amount of an other indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that an other indefinite-lived intangible asset's recorded carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of the other indefinite-lived intangible asset.
in the fourth quarter of 2023, we recognized a $15 million non-cash impairment charge related to a registered trademark within our decorative architectural products segment due to competitive market conditions and increased cost of capital in our lighting business. as of december 31, 2023, the impaired other indefinite-lived intangible asset had a remaining net carrying value of $28 million. a 10 percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our other indefinite-lived intangibles assets would have resulted in a $2 million impairment for another one of our other indefinite-lived intangible assets.
refer to note h for additional information.
income taxes we record deferred taxes on the future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying value of our assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. the realization of deferred tax assets depends on sufficient sources of taxable income in future periods. possible sources of taxable income include taxable income in carryback periods, the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability, tax-planning strategies that generate future income or gains and projected future taxable income.
if, based upon all available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not such deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded. significant weight is given to evidence that is objectively verifiable such as cumulative losses in recent years, however, some evidence may be based on estimates and assumptions regarding potential sources of future taxable income. changes in these estimates and assumptions may result in a change in judgment regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets.
we have loss carryforwards in certain state jurisdictions resulting from perpetual losses for which deferred tax assets were not recognized as the likelihood of utilization was remote. due to a legal restructuring of certain u.s. businesses that will occur in early 2024, it is more likely than not a significant portion of these loss carryforwards will be utilized. as a result, we recognized a $29 million state income tax benefit, net of federal expense, in the fourth quarter of 2023.

item 1a.  risk factors in an enterprise as diverse as ours, a wide range of factors could affect future performance. we discuss in this section some of the risk factors that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, value and results of operations. you should consider these risk factors in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this annual report because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. you should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk factor has not already materialized. additional risks factors may exist that are not presently known by the company or that are currently deemed immaterial may also be present.
risks related to economic conditions changes in united states or international economic conditions, including declines in the industries we serve, could adversely affect the profitability of any of our operations.
in 2023, approximately 34 percent of our revenue was generated in the united states, while approximately 66 percent was generated outside the united states. the covid-19 pandemic and related preventative and mitigation measures implemented by governments around the world and the conflicts in europe and the middle east have to date negatively impacted the global economy and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets.
a general sustained slowdown in the global economy or in a particular region or industry or an increase in trade tensions with u.s. trading partners could negatively impact our business, financial condition or liquidity. our largest markets include consumer non-durable, industrial, medical, electronics, consumer durable and automotive. a slowdown in any of these specific end markets could directly affect our revenue stream and profitability.
a portion of our product sales is attributable to industries and markets, such as the electronics, polymer processing and metal finishing industries, which historically have been cyclical and sensitive to relative changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions. the demand for our products depends, in part, on the general economic conditions of the industries or national economies of our customers. downward economic cycles in our customers' industries or countries may reduce sales of some of our products. it is not possible to predict accurately the factors that will affect demand for our products in the future.
any significant downturn in the health of the general economy, or any recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event, including inflationary pressures, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and financial performance, resulting in impairment of assets. we cannot predict the strength or duration of any economic slowdown and instability or the timing of any recovery.
our results have been and could continue to be impacted by uncertainty in u.s. trade policy, including uncertainty surrounding changes in tariffs, trade agreements or other trade restrictions imposed by the u.s. or other governments.
our ability to conduct business can be significantly impacted by changes in tariffs, changes or repeals of trade agreements, including the impact of the "united states-mexico-canada agreement" with mexico and canada, which replaced the north american free trade agreement, or the imposition of other trade restrictions or retaliatory actions imposed by various governments. other effects of these changes, including impacts on the price of raw materials, responsive actions from governments and the opportunity for competitors to establish a presence in markets where we participate, could also have significant impacts on our results. we cannot predict what further action may be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the u.s. and other governments, and any further changes in u.s. or international trade policy could have an adverse impact on our business. further, the conflicts in europe and the middle east may have significant adverse effects on international trade policy.
significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates or change in monetary policy may harm our financial results.
we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly with respect to the euro, the yen, the pound sterling and the chinese yuan. any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the united states dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. for additional detail related to this risk, see part ii, item 7a, quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk.
a significant portion of our consolidated revenues in 2023 were generated in currencies other than the united states dollar, which is our reporting currency. we recognize foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from our operations in the period incurred. as a result, currency fluctuations between the united states dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused and may continue to cause foreign currency transaction and translation movements, which historically have been material and could continue to be material. we cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved, the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility nordson corporation 10
of currency exchange rates. we take actions to manage our foreign currency exposure, such as entering into hedging transactions, where applicable, but we cannot assure that our strategies will adequately protect our consolidated operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. for example, the impact of conflicts in europe and the middle east, changes in monetary policies and the effects of the departure of the united kingdom from the european union ("brexit") have caused increased volatility in global currency exchange rates that have resulted in the strengthening of the united states dollar against the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. future adverse consequences arising from the conflicts in europe and the middle east and brexit may include continued volatility in exchange rates. any significant fluctuation in exchange rates may be harmful to our financial condition and results of operations. we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into united states dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or customers located in or conducting business in a country imposing controls. currency devaluations diminish the united states dollar value of the currency of the country instituting the devaluation and, if they occur or continue for significant periods, could adversely affect our earnings or cash flow.
risks related to our business and operations political conditions in and between the united states and foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect us.
we conduct our manufacturing, sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to risks associated with doing business both within and outside the united states. we expect that international operations and united states export sales will continue to be important to our business for the foreseeable future. both sales from international operations and export sales are subject to varying degrees of risks inherent in doing business outside the united states. such risks include, but are not limited to, the following:
•risks of political or economic instability;
•unanticipated or unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations;
•threats of war, terrorism or governmental instability, including conflicts in europe and the middle east;
•changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws or other additional tax policies, and other proposals to reform united states and foreign tax laws that impact how united states multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings;
•restrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of a country;
•potential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies;
•the disruption of operations from labor and political disturbances;
•the imposition of tariffs, import or export licensing requirements and other potential changes in trade policies and relations arising from policy initiatives implemented by the u.s. presidential administration; and
•exchange controls or other trade restrictions including transfer pricing restrictions when products produced in one country are sold to an affiliated entity in another country.
any of these events could reduce the demand for our products, limit the prices at which we can sell our products, interrupt our supply chain, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating performance.
our international operations also depend upon favorable trade relations between the u.s. and those foreign countries in which our customers, subcontractors and materials suppliers have operations. a protectionist trade environment in either the u.s. or those foreign countries in which we do business, such as a change in the current tariff structures, export compliance or other trade policies, may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets. the current u.s. presidential administration has criticized existing trade agreements, and while it remains unclear what actions the current or future administration may take with respect to existing and proposed trade agreements, or restrictions on trade generally, more stringent export and import controls may be ultimately imposed in the future.
failure to retain our existing senior management team or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully.
our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our executive management team and the ability to recruit, hire and retain other key management personnel, including factory production workers and other staff, to support our growth and operational initiatives and replace those who retire or resign. failure to retain our leadership team and workforce and to attract and retain other important management and technical personnel could place a constraint on our global nordson corporation 11
growth and operational initiatives, possibly resulting in inefficient and ineffective management and operations, which would likely harm our revenues, operations and product development efforts and eventually result in a decrease in profitability.
the company may be subject to risks relating to organizational changes.
we regularly execute organizational changes such as acquisitions, divestitures and realignments to support our growth and cost management strategies. we also engage in initiatives aimed to increase productivity, efficiencies and cash flow and to reduce costs. the company commits significant resources to identify, develop and retain key employees to ensure uninterrupted leadership and direction. if we are unable to successfully manage these and other organizational changes, the ability to complete such activities and realize anticipated synergies or cost savings as well as our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we cannot offer assurances that any of these initiatives will be beneficial to the extent anticipated, or that the estimated efficiency improvements, incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all.
increased information technology threats and more sophisticated and targeted cybercrime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions and services.
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience cyber-attacks to our systems and networks. to date, we have not experienced any material breaches or material losses related to cyber-attacks. to conduct our business, we rely extensively on information technology systems, networks and services, some of which are managed, hosted and provided by third-party service providers. increased global information technology security threats, more sophisticated and targeted computer crime and cyberterrorism pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and those of our third-party service providers and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information, including but not limited to confidential information relating to customer or employee data, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. a cyber-attack or other disruption may also result in financial loss, including potential fines for failure to safeguard data or losses in connection with any litigation that may result from a cyber-attack. our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs arising from such events.
we have taken steps and incurred costs to further strengthen the security of our computer systems and continue to assess, maintain and enhance the ongoing effectiveness of our information security systems. while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and often are not recognizable until launched against a target. accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. it is therefore possible that in the future we may suffer a criminal attack, unauthorized parties may gain access to personal information in our possession and we may not be able to identify any such incident in a timely manner.
the interpretation and application of data protection laws, including federal, state and international laws, relating to the collection, use, retention, disclosure, security and transfer of personally identifiable data in the u.s., europe and elsewhere (including but not limited to the european union's gdpr and the ccpa), are uncertain and evolving. it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. in addition, as a result of existing or new data protection requirements, we incur and expect to continue to incur significant ongoing operating costs as part of our significant efforts to protect and safeguard our sensitive data and personal information. these efforts also may divert management and employee attention from other business and growth initiatives. a breach in information privacy could result in legal or reputational risks and could have a negative impact on our revenues and results of operations.
a disruption in, shortage of, or price increases for, supply of our components and raw materials may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
while we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products, we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers. the availability and prices for raw materials, parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers' allocation to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers and changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels, including as a result of inflation. the conflicts in europe and the middle east have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, the availability and prices for raw materials, parts, and components. while we generally attempt to pass along higher raw material, part and component costs to our customers in the form of price increases, there historically has been a delay between an increase in our raw material costs and our ability to increase the prices of our products. additionally, we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pricing pressure and other factors. shortages in raw materials or our inability to pass along nordson corporation 12
price increases could affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
in addition, our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and products may be impacted by natural or man-made disruptions, including armed conflict, demand surges, damaging weather or other acts of nature (including weather or other acts of nature caused by climate change), pandemics or other public health crises. a shutdown of, or inability to utilize, one or more of our facilities, our supply chain, or our distribution system could significantly disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, impact our relationships and reputation with customers, suppliers, employees and others, result in lost or decreased sales, or result in legal exposure and large remediation or other expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
if our intellectual property protection is inadequate, others may be able to use our technologies and tradenames and thereby reduce our ability to compete, which could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition and results of operations.
we regard much of the technology underlying our products and the trademarks under which we market our products as proprietary. the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology, or third parties may independently develop similar technology. we rely on a combination of patents, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights. the agreements may be breached or terminated, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, and existing trade secrets, patent and copyright law afford us limited protection. policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization. litigation may be necessary for us to defend against claims of infringement or to protect our intellectual property rights and could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our efforts. further, we might not prevail in such litigation, which could harm our business.
our products could infringe on the intellectual property of others, which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and, if we are not successful, could cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products.
third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us based on their patents or other intellectual property claims, and we may have to pay substantial damages, possibly including treble damages, if it is ultimately determined our products infringe. we may have to obtain a license to sell our products if it is determined that our products infringe upon another party's intellectual property. we might be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license, which, if available at all, may require us to pay substantial royalties. even if infringement claims against us are without merit, defending these types of lawsuits takes significant time, may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns.
risks related to the execution of our strategy we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment, and we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected.
a successful divestiture depends on various factors, including reaching an agreement with potential buyers on terms we deem attractive, as well as our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities, and employees to any purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain, reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collect the proceeds from any divestitures. these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. if we do not realize the expected benefits of any divestiture transaction, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. in addition, divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks, including significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business. furthermore, divestitures potentially involve significant post-closing separation activities, which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources. any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
if we fail to develop new products or enhance existing products, or our customers do not accept the new or enhanced products we develop, our revenue and profitability could be adversely impacted.
innovation is critical to our success. we believe that we must continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and manufacture new products with improved capabilities in order to continue to be a leading provider of precision technology solutions. we also believe that we must continue to make improvements in our productivity in order to maintain our nordson corporation 13
competitive position. difficulties or delays in research, development or production of new or enhanced products or failure to gain market acceptance of new or enhanced products and technologies may reduce future sales and adversely affect our competitive position. we continue to invest in the development and marketing of new or enhanced products. there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses. if we fail to make innovations, launch products with quality problems or the market does not accept our new products, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected. in addition, as new or enhanced products are introduced, we must successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers' ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that we can deliver sufficient supplies of new products to meet customers' demands.
our growth strategy includes acquisitions, and we may not be able to execute on our acquisition strategy or integrate acquisitions successfully.
our recent historical growth has depended, and our future growth is likely to continue to depend, in part on our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations. for example, in august 2023, we completed our acquisition of the arag group. we intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world. we cannot assure we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities, prevail against competing potential acquirers, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets. in addition, we cannot assure that any acquisition, including the recent acquisitions of the arag group and cyberoptics corporation ("cyberoptics"), once successfully integrated, will perform as planned, be accretive to earnings, or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow.
the success of our acquisition strategy is subject to other risks and uncertainties, including:
•our ability to realize operating efficiencies, synergies or other benefits expected from an acquisition, and possible delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company or products;
•diversion of management's time and attention from other business concerns;
•difficulties in retaining key employees, customers or suppliers of the acquired business;
•difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies throughout acquired companies;
•adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers or customers;
•the risks associated with the assumption of product liabilities or contingent or undisclosed liabilities of acquisition targets; and
•the ability to generate future cash flows or the availability of financing.
in addition, an acquisition could adversely impact our operating performance as a result of incurring acquisition-related debt, pre-acquisition potential tax liabilities, acquisition expenses, the amortization of acquisition-acquired assets, or possible future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets associated with the acquisition.
we may also face liability with respect to acquired businesses for violations of environmental laws occurring prior to the date of our acquisition, and some or all of these liabilities may not be covered by environmental insurance secured to mitigate the risk or by indemnification from the sellers from which we acquired these businesses. we could also incur significant costs, including, but not limited to, remediation costs, natural resources damages, civil or criminal fines and sanctions and third-party claims, as a result of past or future violations of, or liabilities, associated with environmental laws.
any impairment in the value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, would negatively affect our operating results and total capitalization.
our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill. the goodwill results from our acquisitions and represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets we acquired. we assess at least annually whether there has been any impairment in the value of our intangible assets. if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, if market conditions for acquired businesses decline, if significant and prolonged negative industry or economic trends exist, if our stock price and market capitalization declines, or if future cash flow estimates decline, we could incur, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment. any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and equity book value, the effect of which could be material.
nordson corporation 14
risks related to legal, compliance and regulatory matters changes in united states and international tax laws may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions. changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, could affect our business, financial condition and profitability by increasing our tax liabilities. our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in our effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles and changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. the u.s. federal government may adopt changes to international trade agreements, tariffs, taxes and other government rules and regulations. while we cannot predict what changes will actually occur with respect to any of these items, such changes could affect our business and results of operations.
we may be exposed to liabilities under the foreign corrupt practices act ("fcpa"), which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
we are subject to compliance with various laws and regulations, including the fcpa, uk bribery act and similar worldwide anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other improper payments to private or public parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining an unfair business advantage. the fcpa also requires proper record keeping and characterization of such payments in our reports filed with the sec. our employees are trained and required to comply with these laws, and we are committed to legal compliance and corporate ethics. violations of these laws could result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and financial penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
the level of returns on pension plan assets, changes in the actuarial assumptions used and management of pension liabilities could adversely affect us.
our operating results may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans. u.s. gaap requires that we calculate pension expense using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon our various assumptions including estimates of expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates for future payment obligations, and the expected rate of increase in future compensation levels. our pension expense and funding requirements may also be affected by our actual return on plan assets and by legislation and other government regulatory actions. changes in assumptions, laws or regulations and how the company manages pension liabilities could lead to variability in financial results and could have a material adverse impact on liquidity.
our global operations are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulatory requirements, and compliance with evolving environmental regulatory requirements could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.
we are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulations affecting international manufacturers, including those related to air and water emissions, waste management and climate change. some environmental laws impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances, even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, or for the conduct of or conditions caused by prior operators, predecessors or third parties. failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities, as well as damage to property or natural resources. these liabilities, sanctions, damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations. in addition, there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future.
changes in environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs. if environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.
it is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to all of our operations within and outside of the united states, even when we are not subject to local government regulations. we may incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, nordson corporation 15
fines and civil or criminal sanctions, liabilities resulting from third-party property damage or personal injury claims, or our products could be prohibited from entering certain jurisdictions, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws, if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws or if we were to undertake environmental protection actions voluntarily.
expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations expose us to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm and other adverse effects on our business.
many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human capital and diversity, equity and inclusion. we make statements about our environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives through information provided on our website, press statements and other communications, including through our esg report. responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments and are impacted by factors that may be outside our control. in addition, some stakeholders may disagree with our goals and initiatives and the focus of stakeholders may change and evolve over time. stakeholders also may have very different views on where environmental, social and governance focus should be placed, including differing views of regulators in various jurisdictions in which we operate. any failure, or perceived failure, by us to achieve our goals, further our initiatives, adhere to our public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against us and materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.
risks related to our capital structure our inability to comply with the restrictive covenants included in the agreements governing our debt or to access additional sources of capital could impede our growth or the repayment or refinancing of existing debt.
the limits imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in the agreement governing our debt could prevent us from making acquisitions or cause us to lose access to these facilities.
the agreements governing our existing debt contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:
•borrow money or guarantee the debts of others;
•use assets as security in other transactions;
•make restricted payments or distributions; and
•sell or acquire assets or merge with or into other companies.
in addition, our credit facilities require us to meet financial ratios, including a "leverage ratio" and an "interest coverage ratio," both as defined in the credit facilities.
these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict our financing activities.
our ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of the agreement governing our debt will depend on our future operating performance. if we fail to comply with such covenants and terms, we may be in default and the maturity of the related debt could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable. we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders in order to maintain compliance under our credit facilities, including waivers with respect to our compliance with certain financial covenants. if we are unable to obtain necessary waivers and the debt under our credit facilities is accelerated, we would be required to obtain replacement financing at prevailing market rates.
we may need new or additional financing in the future to expand our business or refinance existing debt. if we are unable to access capital on satisfactory terms and conditions, we may not be able to expand our business or meet our payment requirements under our existing debt. our ability to obtain new or additional financing will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. we may not be able to obtain new or additional financing because we have substantial debt or because we may not have sufficient cash flow to service or repay our existing or future debt. in addition, depending on market conditions and our financial performance, neither debt nor equity financing may be available on satisfactory terms or at all. finally, as a consequence of worsening financial market conditions, our credit facility providers may not provide the agreed credit if they become undercapitalized.
nordson corporation 16
changes in interest rates could adversely affect us.
any period of interest rate increases may adversely affect our profitability. as of october 31, 2023, we had $1,749,305 of total debt outstanding, of which $553,020 was priced at interest rates that float with the market. a one percentage point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in 2023 would have resulted in approximately $5,530 of additional interest expense. a higher level of floating rate debt would increase the exposure to changes in interest rates. for additional detail related to this risk, see part ii, item 7a, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
general risk factors the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures.
we maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered. we are potentially at risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail or deny our claims. additionally, severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers. in the future, we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain.
our business and operating results may be adversely affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events beyond our control.
while we have taken precautions to prevent production and service interruptions at our global facilities, severe weather conditions, including any that may be caused by global climate change, such as hurricanes or tornadoes, as well as major earthquakes, wildfires and other natural disasters in areas in which we have manufacturing facilities or from which we obtain products may cause physical damage to our properties, closure of one or more of our manufacturing or distribution facilities, lack of an adequate work force in a market, temporary disruption in the supply of inventory, disruption in the transport of products and utilities, and delays in the delivery of products to our customers. any of these factors may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations note regarding amounts and fiscal year references in this annual report, all amounts related to united states dollars and foreign currency and to the number of nordson corporation's common shares, except for per share earnings and dividend amounts, are expressed in thousands. unless the context otherwise indicates, all references to "we," "us," "our," or the "company" mean nordson corporation.
unless otherwise noted, all references to years relate to our fiscal year ending october 31.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that are used to prepare financial statements. we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management.
certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below. on a regular basis, critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors.
revenue recognition - a contract exists when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of the consideration is probable. revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contract with a customer are satisfied. generally, our revenue results from short-term, fixed-price contracts and is recognized as of a point in time when the product is shipped or at a later point when the control of the product transfers to the customer. refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the company's revenue recognition policy.
business combinations - the acquisitions of our businesses are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition, with the remainder, if any, recorded as goodwill. the fair values are determined by management, taking into consideration information supplied by the management of the acquired entities, and other relevant information. such information typically includes valuations obtained from independent appraisal experts, which management reviews and considers in its estimates of fair values. the valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets, discounted to present value. determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future revenue growth rates and ebitda margins, discount rates, customer attrition rates, and asset lives, among other items. this judgment could result in either a higher or lower value assigned to amortizable or depreciable assets. the impact could result in either higher or lower amortization and/or depreciation expense.
goodwill - goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in various business combinations. goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level, or more often if indications of impairment exist.
we test goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification ("asc") 350. we did not record any goodwill impairment charges in 2023. we use an independent valuation specialist to assist with refining our assumptions and methods used to determine fair values. to test for goodwill impairment, we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units using a combination of the income approach and the market approach.
the discounted cash flow method ("income approach") uses assumptions for revenue growth, operating margin and working capital turnover that are based on management's strategic plans tempered by performance trends and reasonable expectations about those trends. terminal value calculations employ a published formula known as the gordon growth model method that essentially captures the present value of perpetual cash flows beyond the last projected period assuming a constant weighted average cost of capital ("wacc") methodology and growth rate. for each reporting unit, a sensitivity analysis is performed to vary the discount and terminal growth rates in order to provide a range of reasonableness for detecting impairment. discount rates are developed using a wacc methodology.
the wacc represents the blended average required rate of return for equity and debt capital based on observed market return data and company specific risk factors. for 2023, the wacc rates used ranged from 8.3 percent to 11.0 percent depending upon the reporting unit's size, end market volatility and projection risk. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding the valuation methodologies used.

in 2023, 2022 and 2021, the results of our annual impairment tests indicated no impairment.
the fair value ("fv") was compared to the carrying value ("cv") for each reporting unit. based on the results shown in the table below and based on our measurement date of august 1, 2023, our conclusion is that no goodwill was impaired in 2023. potential events or circumstances, such as a sustained downturn in global economies, could have a negative effect on estimated fair values.

pension plan in the united states - the measurement of the liabilities related to our domestic pension plan is based on management's assumptions related to future factors, including interest rates, return on pension plan assets, compensation increases, mortality and turnover assumptions, and health care cost trend rates. the liabilities associated with the company's international pension plans and opeb are not as materially sensitive to changes in assumptions as the pension plan in the united states.
the weighted-average discount rate used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 6.08 percent at october 31, 2023 and 5.70 percent at october 31, 2022. the discount rate used was determined by using quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled.
in determining the expected return on plan assets, we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future long-term rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans. we consult with and consider the opinions of financial and actuarial experts in developing appropriate return assumptions. the expected rate of return (long-term investment rate) on domestic pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 6.40 percent and 5.75 percent in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
the assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 3.92 percent and 4.30 percent at october 31, 2023 and october 31, 2022, respectively.
annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year. differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized into expense over a period of years.
economic assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. the effect of a one percent change in the discount rate, expected return on assets and compensation increase is shown in the table below. bracketed numbers represent decreases in expense and obligation amounts.

income taxes - income taxes are estimated based on income for financial reporting purposes. deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and certain changes in valuation allowances. we provide valuation allowances nordson corporation 25
against deferred tax assets if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
management believes the valuation allowances are adequate after considering future taxable income, allowable carryforward periods and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount (including the valuation allowance), an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made. conversely, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be expensed in the period such determination was made.
further, at each interim reporting period, we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full year. significant judgment is involved regarding the application of global income tax laws and regulations and when projecting the jurisdictional mix of income. additionally, interpretation of tax laws, court decisions or other guidance provided by taxing authorities influences our estimate of the effective income tax rates. as a result, our actual effective income tax rates and related income tax liabilities may differ materially from our estimated effective tax rates and related income tax liabilities. any resulting differences are recorded in the period they become known.
arag group acquisition on august 24, 2023, the company completed the acquisition of the arag group pursuant to the terms of the sale and purchase agreement, dated as of june 25, 2023, by and among the company and the sellers. arag is a global market and innovation leader in the development, production and supply of precision control systems and smart fluid components for agricultural spraying. arag operates as a division of our industrial precision solutions segment. in anticipation of the acquisition, the company entered into a €760,000 senior unsecured term loan facility with a group of banks in august 2023 (the "364-day term loan facility"). the all-cash arag acquisition of approximately €957,000, net of the repayment of approximately €30,300 of debt of the acquired companies, was funded using borrowings under the 364-day term loan facility and the company's revolving credit facility. the 364-day term loan facility was subsequentially paid off in september 2023 with the net proceeds of a senior notes offering (see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details). based on the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, goodwill of $694,900 and identifiable intangible assets of $353,500 were recorded. the identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of $27,500 of tradenames (amortized over nine years), $31,000 of technology (amortized over five years), and $295,000 of customer relationships (amortized over twenty-two years). the financial results of the arag group acquisition are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

as used throughout this annual report, geographic regions include the americas (united states, canada, mexico and central and south america), asia pacific and europe.
2023 compared to 2022
worldwide sales for 2023 were $2,628,632, an increase of 1.5 percent from 2022 sales of $2,590,278. the increase consisted of a 3.8 percent increase from acquisitions, partially offset by a 1.4 percent decline in organic sales and unfavorable currency translation effects that decreased sales by 0.9 percent.
sales outside the united states accounted for 66.2 percent of total sales in 2023, as compared to 66.8 percent in 2022. on a geographic basis, sales in the americas region were $1,149,760, an increase of 4.8 percent from 2022, with organic sales increasing 2.0 percent, a 2.4 percent increase from acquisitions, and favorable currency effects of 0.4 percent. sales in the asia pacific region were $796,196, a decrease of 6.1 percent from 2022, with organic sales decreasing 8.2 percent and unfavorable currency effects of 3.1 percent, partially offset by a 5.2 percent increase from acquisitions. sales in europe were $682,676, an increase of 5.7 percent from 2022, with organic sales increasing 1.4 percent, a 4.2 percent increase from acquisitions, and favorable currency effects of 0.1 percent.
cost of sales were $1,203,227 in 2023, up 3.4 percent from $1,163,742 in 2022. gross profit, expressed as a percentage of sales, decreased to 54.2 percent in 2023 from 55.1 percent in 2022. the 0.9 percentage point decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by incremental inventory step-up amortization related to acquisitions in 2023 of $8,862 and unfavorable foreign currency effects.
nordson corporation 26
selling and administrative expenses were $752,644 in 2023, up from $724,176 in 2022. the 3.9 percent increase was driven by a 8.3 percent increase due to the first-year effect of an acquisition, including acquisition costs, partially offset by lower base business costs and favorable currency translation effects which decreased costs by 5.3 percent. selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased slightly to 28.6 percent in 2023 from 28.0 percent in 2022. the 0.6 percentage point increase was primarily due to cost structure simplification actions taken in 2023.
operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 25.6 percent in 2023 compared to 27.1 percent in 2022. the 1.5 percent decrease in operating margin was primarily driven by inventory step-up amortization and other costs related to the first-year effect of acquisitions.
interest expense in 2023 was $59,505, an increase of $37,092, or 165.5 percent, from 2022. the increase was due to higher average debt levels and higher average interest rates compared to the prior year primarily driven by acquisitions. during 2022, the company recognized non-cash pension settlement charges of $41,221 related to the purchase of an annuity contract to relieve the company of certain u.s. pension benefit obligations. other expense in 2023 was $597 compared to other income of $8,527 in 2022. included in other expense in 2023 were $7,742 in net foreign currency losses, which were largely offset by pension gains. included in the prior year's other income were $6,270 in foreign currency gains.
income tax expense in 2023 was $127,846, or 20.8 percent of pre-tax income, as compared to $136,176, or 21.0 percent of pre-tax income in 2022. the income tax provision for 2023 included a tax benefit of $4,286 due to our share-based payment transactions. our income tax provision for 2022 included a tax benefit of $3,273 due to our share-based payment transactions.
net income was $487,493, or $8.46 per diluted share, in 2023, compared to net income of $513,103, or $8.81 per diluted share, in 2022. this represented a 5.0 percent decrease in net income and a 4.1 percent decrease in diluted earnings per share. the decrease of $0.35 per diluted share was primarily driven by higher interest expense and acquisition-related expenses in 2023 compared to non-cash pension settlement charges in 2022.
industrial precision solutions sales of the industrial precision solutions segment were $1,391,046 in 2023, an increase of 4.0 percent, from 2022 sales of $1,337,242. the increase was the result of an organic sales increase of 3.1 percent and an increase of 1.9 percent from acquisitions, partially offset by unfavorable currency effects of 1.0 percent. organic sales growth was generally strong across most product lines and regions.
operating profit as a percentage of sales increased to 33.1 percent in 2023 compared to 32.5 percent in 2022. the 0.6 percentage point improvement in operating margin was primarily the result of improved selling and administrative expense leverage due to increased sales volumes.
medical and fluid solutions sales of the medical and fluid solutions segment were $660,316 in 2023, a decrease of 4.3 percent from 2022 sales of $690,177. the decrease was the result of an organic sales decrease of 3.7 percent and unfavorable currency effects that decreased sales by 0.6 percent. the organic sales decrease was driven by lower demand for the medical fluid components and fluid solutions product lines, materially offset by continued strength in medical interventional solutions product lines.
operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 28.7 percent in 2023 compared to 31.5 percent in 2022. the 2.8 percent percentage point decline in operating margin was principally driven by meaningful sales mix changes within medical product lines and related factory inefficiencies due to reduced volumes.
advanced technology solutions sales of the advanced technology solutions segment were $577,270 in 2023, an increase of 2.6 percent from 2022 sales of $562,859. the increase consisted of a volume increase of 3.7 percent, inclusive of an organic sales decrease of 9.2 percent and a 12.9 percent increase from acquisitions, partially offset by unfavorable currency effects that decreased sales by 1.1 percent. the organic sales decrease was driven by lower demand in electronics dispense product lines, partially offset by stronger demand in test and inspection product lines.
operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 17.6 percent in 2023 compared to 23.7 percent in 2022. the 6.1 percentage point decline in operating margin was primarily due to fees, severance, and non-cash inventory charges of $10,295 associated with the cyberoptics acquisition and factory inefficiencies due to reduced volumes.
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased $47,778 in 2023 to $115,679 as of october 31, 2023 compared to $163,457 as of october 31, 2022. approximately 81 percent of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents were held at various foreign subsidiaries as of october 31, 2023.
nordson corporation 27
cash provided by operating activities was $641,282 in 2023, compared to $513,131 in 2022. the primary sources were net income adjusted for non-cash income and expenses (consisting of depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock compensation, provision for losses on receivables, deferred income taxes, other non-cash expense, gain/loss on sale of property, plant and equipment, and non-cash pension settlement charges), which were $615,496 in 2023, compared to $676,200 in 2022. changes in working capital items used cash of $3,571 compared to $107,314 used in 2022 principally driven by decreases in receivables and inventory while cash provided by other operating items was $29,357 in 2023 compared to cash used of $55,755 in 2022.
cash used in investing activities was $1,436,879 in 2023, compared to $222,761 in 2022. in 2023, $1,422,780 in cash was used for acquisitions, utilizing borrowings and cash from operations, compared to $171,613 used in 2022. capital expenditures were $34,583 in 2023 compared to $51,428 in 2022.
cash provided by financing activities was $750,512 in 2023, compared to $416,006 cash used in 2022. proceeds and repayments of long-term debt provided $976,043 of cash in 2023, compared to $33,908 used in 2022. in 2023, cash of $89,708 was used for the purchase of treasury shares, down from $262,869 used in 2022. dividend payments were $150,356 in 2023, up from $125,914 in 2022 due to an increase in dividends on our common shares, on an annual basis, to $2.63 per share from $2.18 per share. issuance of common shares related to employee benefit plans generated $21,373 of cash in 2023, up from $12,124 in 2022.
the following is a summary of significant changes by balance sheet caption from october 31, 2022 to october 31, 2023. receivables-net and inventories-net combined increased $124,950, goodwill increased $979,508, and intangible assets-net increased $343,342 principally due to the acquisitions of the arag group and cyberoptics. long-term debt, including current maturities, increased $999,199, principally due to the acquisition of the arag group.
we have a $1,150,000 unsecured multi-currency credit facility with a group of banks which provides for a term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $300,000, maturing in june 2026, and a multicurrency revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $850,000, maturing in june 2028. in anticipation of the arag acquisition, the company entered into the 364-day term loan facility in august 2023. on september 13, 2023, the company completed an underwritten public offering of $350,000 aggregate principal amount of the company's 5.600% notes due 2028 (the "2028 notes") and $500,000 aggregate principal amount of the company's 5.800% notes due 2033 (together with the 2028 notes, the "notes"). the company used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to repay its borrowings under the 364-day term loan facility. at october 31, 2023, we had $300,000 outstanding on the term loan facility and $248,000 outstanding on the revolving credit facility compared to no outstanding balance at october 31, 2022 under the old revolving credit facility.
our operating performance, balance sheet position and financial ratios for 2023 remained strong. total debt increased $999,199 during 2023 primarily due to the acquisition of the arag group. the company is well-positioned to manage liquidity needs that arise from working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and contributions related to pension and postretirement obligations, as well as principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt. primary sources of capital to meet these needs, as well as other opportunistic investments, are a combination of cash provided by operations and borrowings under our loan agreements. cash from operations, which when combined with our available borrowing capacity and ready access to capital markets, is expected to be more than adequate to fund our liquidity needs over the twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter. the company believes it has the ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet its long-term needs for cash.

we believe that the combination of present capital resources, cash from operations and unused financing sources such as our credit facilities, including our revolving credit facility, are more than adequate to meet cash requirements for the twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter. there are no significant restrictions limiting the transfer of funds from international subsidiaries to the parent company.
new accounting standards there have been no new accounting standards issued which would require either disclosure or adoption during the current period by the company.
effects of foreign currency the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured due to fluctuating selling prices, sales volume, product mix and cost structures in each country where we operate. as a general rule, a weakening of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income, while a strengthening of the dollar has a detrimental effect.
in 2023, as compared with 2022, the united states dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies. if 2022 exchange rates had been in effect during 2023, sales would have been approximately $23,153 higher and third-party costs would have been approximately $15,210 higher. in 2022, as compared with 2021, the united states dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies. if 2021 exchange rates had been in effect during 2022, sales would have been approximately $103,829 higher and third-party costs would have been approximately $68,788 higher. these effects on reported sales do not include the impact of local price adjustments made in response to changes in currency exchange rates.
trends our solid historical performance is attributed to our diverse geographic and end market participation and our long-term commitment to develop and provide quality products and worldwide service to meet our customers' changing needs.

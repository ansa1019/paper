  environmental matters, legal proceedings and other contingencies;
  accounting matters and
  performance and liquidity measures.
for management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) related to the year ended december 31, 2021, refer to this same section in our 2022 annual report on form 10-k as filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 17, 2023.
economic and market conditions affecting our operations our market conditions and the strength of the broader u.s. economy are, and will continue to be, influenced by the trajectory of activity in the u.s. housing and repair and remodel segments, inflation trends and interest rates.
the demand for sawlogs within our timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. the strength of the u.s. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our wood products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the u.s., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products.
our timberlands segment, specifically the western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy.
japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in japan. the demand for pulpwood from our timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (osb)
weyerhaeuser company >2023 annual report and form 10-k43
table of contents as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. our timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. in general, western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while southern log markets have more available supply. however, additional mill capacity being added in the u.s. south has led to tightening of markets in certain geographies. our real estate, energy and natural resources segment is affected by a variety of factors, including the general state of the economy, local real estate market conditions, the level of construction activity in the u.s. and evolution of emerging renewable energy and carbon-related markets.
over the past year, particularly in the first half of 2023, home sales and building activity slowed due in part to higher mortgage interest rates, reduced affordability and general macroeconomic conditions. in the latter part of
2023, new home sales and construction activity strengthened, supported by near record-low levels of existing inventory. on a seasonally adjusted annual basis, as reported by the u.s. census bureau, housing starts for fourth quarter 2023 averaged 1.5 million units, a 6.1 percent increase from third quarter 2023. single-family starts averaged1.0 million units in fourth quarter 2023, a 7.7 percent increase from third quarter 2023. multi-family starts averaged412thousand units in fourth quarter 2023, which was a 2.2 percent increase from third quarter 2023.
single-family construction is the primary driver for our business as compared to multi-family due to the amount of wood products used. sales of newly built, single-family homes averaged a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 652
thousand units for fourth quarter 2023, a decrease of 6.0 percent from third quarter 2023. over the medium to long-
term, we expect a favorable u.s. housing construction market supported by strong demographics in the key homebuying age cohorts, a decade of underbuilding and a historically low housing inventory.
repair and remodeling expenditures were steady from third quarter 2023 to fourth quarter 2023 according to the census bureau advance retail spending report. do-it-yourself activity has been returning to more normalized levels while professionally contracted activities have benefited from larger projects and increases in home equity levels.
over the longer term, we expect this sector to return to pre-pandemic growth trends with healthy household balance sheets, elevated home equity and an aging u.s. housing stock, with a median age of 43 years.
in u.s. wood product markets, demand for lumber and osb was influenced by cautious buyer sentiment at the outset of fourth quarter 2023. as the quarter progressed, demand increased in response to strong single-family housing starts and improving macroeconomic conditions. the random lengths framing lumber composite price averaged $384/mbf and the osb composite averaged $406/msf in fourth quarter 2023. over the course of the fourth quarter, composite prices for lumber decreased from $422/mbf to $395/mbf and composite prices for osb decreased from $454/msf to $430/msf.
in western log markets, douglas fir sawlog prices decreased 2.8 percent in fourth quarter 2023 compared with third quarter 2023, as reported by fastmarkets risi log lines based on weyerhaeuser's sales mix. overall, domestic log demand and prices faced downward pressure at the outset of the quarter, as mills adjusted to a softening lumber market and worked through elevated log inventories. as the quarter progressed, lumber markets improved, and log supply decreased seasonally. in the south, delivered sawlog prices decreased 0.5 percent in fourth quarter 2023
compared to third quarter 2023 and declined 3.6 percent from fourth quarter 2022 as reported by timbermart-south.
this was primarily driven by ample log supply, elevated mill inventories and reduced demand for finished goods during the quarter.
currency exchange rates, available supply from other countries and trade policy affect our export businesses.
during fourth quarter 2023, end use demand in export markets was mixed. in japan, total housing starts decreased
4.7 percent year to date through november compared to the same period in 2022, while the key post and beam segmentsaw a 6.2 percent decrease. lumber imports to japan from europe were more balanced than in previous quarters, providing support for logs. china's weaker end use demand for logs and lumber was offset by lower competitive supply, leading to stable pricing for logs from the west.
interest rates affect our business primarily through their impact on mortgage rates and housing affordability, their general impact on the economy and their influence on our capital management activities. actions by the u.s.
federal reserve, the overall condition of the economy and fluctuations in financial markets are all factors that influence long-term interest rates. 30-year mortgage rates, which are correlated with long-term interest rates, decreased from 7.3 percent at the end of third quarter 2023 to 6.6 percent at the end of fourth quarter 2023, according to economic data from freddie mac. many builders have been able to offset higher mortgage rates through discounts, mortgage rate buydowns and modifying product offerings such as home sizes and finishes. higher rates have also locked-in many existing homeowners from selling, reducing inventories of existing homes for sale which has led to increased demand for available new homes.
increased inflation affects the cost of our operations across each of our business segments, including costs for raw materials, transportation, energy and labor. the consumer price index increased at an annual rate of 3.4
percent as of december 2023, which is markedly down from its peak of over 9.0 percent annual increase in june 2022.
while we can offset some of the impacts of inflation through our sales activities, our operational excellence initiatives and our procurement practices, not all of the costs associated with inflation can be fully mitigated or passed on to the consumer.
the condition of the labor market affects all of our businesses as it relates to our ability to attract and retain employees and contractors. the unemployment rate of 3.7 percent in december 2023 remained near historically low levels and decreased 0.1 percent from the end of third quarter 2023.
governments and businesses across the globe are taking action on climate change and are making significant commitments towards decarbonizing operations and reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero. achieving these commitments will require governments and companies to take major steps to modify operations, invest in low-carbon activities and purchase credits to reduce environmental impacts. we believe we are uniquely positioned to help entities achieve these commitments through natural climate solutions, including forest carbon sequestration, carbon capture and storage and renewable energy activities.

net charge to earnings decreased by $240 million - 56 percent - primarily due to a $209 million decrease in non-
operating pension and other post-employment benefit costs attributable to a $205 million pension settlement charge recorded in fourth quarter 2022 (refer tonote 8: pension and other post-employment benefit plans), as well as a $51
million increase in interest income and other attributable to interest earned on short-term investments held for a portion of the year in 2023 and an increase in the interest rate on our cash and investment accounts.

  $280 million in 2023 and
  $270 million in 2022.
interest expense increased by $10 million compared to 2022 primarily due to the may 2023 issuance of debt securities that increased our weighted average outstanding debt.

liquidity and capital resources we are committed to maintaining an appropriate capital structure that provides financial flexibility and enables us to protect the interests of our shareholders and meet our obligations to our lenders, while also maintaining access to all major financial markets. as of december 31, 2023, we had $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.5
billion of availability on our line of credit, which expires in march 2028. we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future.
cash from operations consolidated net cash from operations was:
  $1,433 million in 2023 and
  $2,832 million in 2022.
comparing 2023 with 2022
net cash from operations decreased by $1,399 million, primarily due to decreased cash inflows from our business operations. this change was partially offset by a $503 million decrease in our cash paid for income taxes.
pension contributions and benefit payments made and expected during 2023, we contributed a total of $20 million to our pension and post-employment benefit plans, compared to a total of $24 million during 2022.
for 2024, we expect to contribute approximately $20 million to our pension and post-employment benefit plans. refer tonote 8: pension and other post-employment benefit plansfor further information.

  future economic conditions,
  environmental regulations,
  changes in the composition of our business,
  weather,
  timing of equipment purchases and
  capital needs related to other business opportunities.
financing cash from financing activities includes items such as:
  issuances and payments of debt,
  borrowings and payments on our revolving line of credit and
  payments for cash dividends and repurchasing stock.
consolidated net cash from financing activities was:
  $(1,342) million in 2023 and
  $(2,491) million in 2022.
comparing 2023 with 2022
net cash from financing activities increased by $1,149 million in 2023, primarily due to:
  a $412 million decrease in cash used for repurchases of common stock;
  a $401 million decrease in cash paid for dividends and
  a $336 million decrease in net cash used for payments on long-term debt.
long-term debt our consolidated long-term debt (including current portion) was:
  $5,069 million as of december 31, 2023 and
  $5,053 million as of december 31, 2022.
the increase in our long-term debt during 2023 is primarily attributable to the may 2023 issuance of $750 million of 4.750 percent notes and the december 2023 issuance of a $250 million senior unsecured term loan, offset by the december 2023 repayment of our $860 million 5.207 percent note and the july 2023 repayment of our $118 million
7.125 percent notes.
the weighted average interest rate and the weighted average maturity on our long-term debt as of december 31, 2023
were 5.35 percent and 7.6 years, respectively.

line of credit in march 2023, we entered into a new $1.5 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in march 2028 and replaced the existing facility which was set to expire in january 2025. borrowings will bear interest at a floating rate based on either the adjusted term secured overnight financing rate (sofr) plus a spread or a mutually agreed upon base rate plus a spread. as of december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility and we were in compliance with the revolving credit facility covenants.
weyerhaeuser company >2023 annual report and form 10-k52
table of contents our covenants our key covenants include the requirement to maintain:
  a minimum total adjusted shareholders' equity of $3.0 billion and
  a defined debt-to-total-capital ratio of 65 percent or less.
our total adjusted shareholders' equity is comprised of:
  total shareholders' equity,
  excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),
  minus our investment in our unrestricted subsidiaries.
our capitalization is comprised of:
  total debt,
  plus total adjusted shareholders' equity.
as of december 31, 2023, we had:
  total adjusted shareholders' equity of $10.5 billion and
  a defined debt-to-total-capital ratio of 32.5 percent.
when calculating compliance in accordance with financial debt covenants as of december 31, 2023 and december 31,

there are no other significant financial debt covenants related to our third-party debt.
credit ratings as of december 31, 2023, our long-term issuer credit rating was bbb and baa2 from s&p and moody's, respectively.
dividends we paid cash dividends on common shares of:
  $1,216 million in 2023 and
  $1,617 million in 2022.
the decrease in dividends paid is primarily due to a supplemental dividend of $0.90 per share based on 2022
financial results for a total of $660 million paid in first quarter 2023 in comparison to a supplemental dividend of $1.45 per share based on 2021 financial results for a total of $1,084 million paid in first quarter 2022.
on january 25, 2024, our board of directors declared a supplemental dividend of $0.14 per share based on 2023
financial results. the dividend is payable on february 27, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on february 16, 2024.
we plan to supplement our base dividend each year with an additional return of cash, in the form of a supplemental cash dividend and/or share repurchase, to achieve our targeted annual payout of total cash to shareholders of 75 to
80 percent of adjusted funds available for distribution (adjusted fad). for further information on adjusted fad seeperformance and liquidity measures.
share repurchases we repurchased 4.1 million common shares for approximately $125 million (including transaction fees) during the year ended december 31, 2023. we repurchased 16.0 million common shares for approximately $550 million (including transaction fees) in 2022. as of december 31, 2023, we had remaining authorization of $252 million for future share repurchases. for further information on share repurchases seenote 14: shareholders' interest.

obligations(3)
amounts presented for interest payments assume that all long-term debt obligations outstanding as of december 31,
2023 will remain outstanding until maturity.
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction. purchase obligations exclude arrangements that the company can cancel without penalty.
the timing of certain payments within this category will be triggered by retirements or other events. these payments can include workers compensation, deferred compensation and banked vacation, among other obligations. when the timing of payment is uncertain, the amounts are included in the total column only. minimum pension funding is required by established funding standards and estimates are not made for 2025 onward. estimated payments of contractually obligated post-employment benefits are not included due to the uncertainty of payment timing.
off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements have not had - and are not reasonably likely to have - a material effect on our current or future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.note 10: line of creditcontains our disclosures of surety bonds and letters of credit.
environmental matters, legal proceedings and other contingencies seenote 13: legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies.
accounting matters critical accounting estimates in the preparation of our financial statements we follow established accounting policies and make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. we base our judgments and estimates on historical experience and assumptions we believe are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances. actual results, however, could differ materially from the estimated amounts we have recorded. some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. accounting policies whose application involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and may have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition are considered critical accounting estimates.
discount rates for pension and post-employment benefit plans discount rates are used to estimate the net present value of our pension and other post-employment plan obligations. these rates are determined at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits. the selection of discount rates requires judgment as well as the involvement of actuarial specialists. these specialists assist with selecting yield curves based on published indices for high-quality corporate bonds and projecting the timing and amount of cash flows associated with our obligations to ultimately support our determination of an appropriate discount rate for each plan.
our discount rates as of december 31, 2023 are:
  5.2 percent for our u.s. pension plans - compared with 5.4 percent at december 31, 2022;
  5.1 percent for our u.s. post-employment benefit plans - compared with 5.4 percent at december 31, 2022;
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  4.7 percent for our canadian pension plans - compared with 5.3 percent at december 31, 2022 and
  4.6 percent for our canadian post-employment benefit plans - compared with 5.3 percent at december 31, 2022.
pension expenses for 2024 will be based on the 5.2 percent and 4.7 percent assumed discount rates for the u.s.
pension plans and the canadian pension plans, respectively, and the 5.1 percent and 4.6 percent assumed discount rates for the u.s. and canadian post-employment benefit plans, respectively.

performance and liquidity measures we use adjusted ebitda as a key performance measure to evaluate the performance of the consolidated company and our business segments. this measure should not be considered in isolation from, and is not intended to represent an alternative to, our results reported in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap).
however, we believe adjusted ebitda provides meaningful supplemental information for our investors about our operating performance, better facilitates period to period comparisons and is widely used by analysts, lenders, rating agencies and other interested parties. our definition of adjusted ebitda may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies. adjusted ebitda, as we define it, is operating income adjusted for depreciation, depletion, amortization, basis of real estate sold and special items.

we reconcile net earnings before special items to net earnings and net earnings per diluted share before special items to net earnings per diluted share, as those are the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measures. we believe the measures provide meaningful supplemental information for investors about our operating performance, better facilitate period to period comparisons, and are widely used by analysts, lenders, rating agencies and other interested parties.

special items we use adjusted funds available for distribution (adjusted fad) to evaluate the company's liquidity and measure cash generated during the period (net of capital expenditures and significant nonrecurring items) that is available for dividends, repurchases of common shares, debt reduction, acquisitions, and other discretionary and nondiscretionary capital allocation activities. adjusted fad should not be considered in isolation from, and is not intended to represent an alternative to, results reported in accordance with u.s. gaap. however, we believe the measure provides meaningful supplemental information for our investors about our liquidity. adjusted fad, as we define it, is net cash from operations adjusted for capital expenditures and significant non-recurring items. our definition of adjusted fad may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies, including those in our industry. we reconcile adjusted fad to net cash from operations, as that is the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measure.

table of contents financial statements and supplementary data report of independent registered public accounting firm to the shareholders and board of directors weyerhaeuser company:
opinion on the consolidatedfinancial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of weyerhaeuser company and subsidiaries (the company)
as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended december 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company as of december 31, 2023
and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended december 31, 2023, in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2023, based on criteria established ininternal control - integrated framework (2013)issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission, and our report dated february 16, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting.
basis for opinion these consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
critical audit matter the critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)
relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
projected benefit obligations for pensions as discussed in notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the company's projected benefit obligations for pension plans were $2,347 million as of december 31, 2023, which included the projected benefit obligation for the u.s. qualified pension plans. the company estimates the liability related to their pension plans using actuarial models that include assumptions about the company's discount rates.
we identified the evaluation of the company's projected benefit obligation for the u.s. qualified pension plans as a critical audit matter. this is due to the sensitivity of the obligation to changes in the discount rate used and the subjectivity in evaluating the rate. additionally, the assessment of the discount rate required specialized actuarial skills and knowledge.
the following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the u.s. qualified pension obligation process. this included controls related to the actuarial determination of the discount rate used in the valuation of the projected benefit obligation for the u.s. qualified pension plans. these procedures also included analyzing year-over-year changes to the projected cash flows associated with the obligation. additionally, we involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in the evaluation of the company's discount rate by:
evaluating the selected yield curve used to determine the discount rate assessing changes in the discount rate from the prior year against changes in published indices evaluating the discount rate based on the projected cash flows compared with those of similar plans.

table of contents notes toconsolidated financial statements note 1: summary of significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies describe:
  our election to be taxed as a real estate investment trust,
  how we report our results,
  changes in how we report our results and
  how we account for certain key items.
our election to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (reit) our company is a reit and reit income can be distributed to shareholders without first paying corporate level tax, substantially eliminating the double taxation on income. we expect to derive most of our reit income from investments in timberlands, including the sale of standing timber through pay-as-cut sales contracts and lump sum timber deeds. we continue to be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on earnings of our taxable reit subsidiaries (trss), which include our wood products segment and portions of our timberlands and real estate, energy and natural resources (real estate & enr) segments.
how we report our results our report includes:
  consolidated financial statements,
  our business segments,
  estimates,
  fair value measurements and
  foreign currency translation.
consolidated financial statements our consolidated financial statements provide an overall view of our results and financial condition. they include our accounts and the accounts of entities that we control, including:
  majority-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries and
  variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary.
they do not include our intercompany transactions and accounts, which are eliminated.
throughout thesenotes to consolidated financial statements, unless specified otherwise, references to
"weyerhaeuser," "the company," "we" and "our" refer to the consolidated company.
our business segments reportable business segments are determined based on the company's "management approach," as defined by financial accounting standards board (fasb) accounting standards codification (asc) topic 280,segment reporting. the management approach is based on the way the chief operating decision maker organizes the segments within a company for making decisions about resources to be allocated and assessing their performance.
we are principally engaged in:
  growing and harvesting timber;
  maximizing the value of our acreage through the sale of higher and better use (hbu) properties and monetizing the value of surface and subsurface assets through leases and royalties and
  manufacturing, distributing and selling products made from trees.
our business segments are organized based primarily on products and services.
segment            products and services timberlands        logs, timber, recreational leases and other products.
real estate & enr  real estate (sales of timberlands) and enr (rights to explore for and extract hard minerals, construction materials, natural gas production, wind and solar).
wood products      structural lumber, oriented strand board, engineered wood products and building materials distribution.
weyerhaeuser company > 2023 annual report and form 10-k 66
table of contents we also transfer raw materials, semi-finished materials and end products among our business segments. because of this intracompany activity, accounting for our business segments involves pricing products transferred between our business segments at current market values.
unallocated items are gains or charges not related to, or allocated to, an individual operating segment. they include all or a portion of items such as share-based compensation, pension and post-employment costs, elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and lifo, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, interest income and other.
estimates we prepare our financial statements according to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap). this requires us to make estimates and assumptions during our reporting periods and at the date of our financial statements. the estimates and assumptions affect our:
  reported amounts of assets, liabilities and equity;
  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and
  reported amounts of revenues and expenses.
while we believe the assumptions used in preparing these estimates are appropriate and reasonable, actual results can and do differ from those estimates and assumptions.
fair value measurements we use a fair value hierarchy in accounting for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities including:
  long-lived assets (asset groups) measured at fair value for an impairment assessment;
  pension plan assets measured at fair value and
  asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value.
the fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable. observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity's pricing based upon its own market assumptions.
the fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:
  level 1: inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in an active market.
  level 2: inputs are quoted prices in non-active markets for which pricing inputs are observable either directly or indirectly at the reporting date.
  level 3: inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable.
foreign currency translation we translate foreign currencies into u.s. dollars in two ways:
  assets and liabilities - at the exchange rates in effect as of our balance sheet date and
  revenues and expenses - at average monthly exchange rates throughout the year.
changes in how we report our results changes in how we report our results come from:
  reclassification of certain balances and results from prior years to make them consistent with our current reporting and
  accounting changes made upon our adoption of new accounting guidance.
reclassifications we have reclassified certain balances and results from prior years to be consistent with our 2023
reporting. this makes balances comparable from year to year. our reclassifications had no effect on consolidated net earnings or equity.
how we account for certain key items this section provides information about how we account for certain key items related to:
  capital investments,
  financing our business and
  our operations.
items related to capital investments key items related to accounting for capital investments pertain to property and equipment, timber and timberlands and impairment of long-lived assets.
weyerhaeuser company > 2023 annual report and form 10-k 67
table of contents property and equipment we maintain property accounts on an individual asset basis and account for them as follows:
  improvements to and replacements of major units of property are capitalized.
  maintenance, repairs and minor replacements are expensed.
  depreciation is calculated using a straight-line method at rates based on estimated service lives.
  costs associated with logging roads that we intend to utilize for a period longer than one year are capitalized. these roads are then amortized over an estimated service life.
  cost and accumulated depreciation of property sold or retired are removed from the accounts and the gain or loss is included in earnings.
timber and timberlands we carry timber and timberlands at cost less depletion. depletion refers to the carrying value of timber that is harvested or sold.
key activities affecting how we account for timber and timberlands include:
  reforestation,
  depletion and
  forest management in canada.
reforestation.generally, we capitalize initial site preparation and planting costs as reforestation and then expense costs after the first planting as they are incurred or over the period of expected benefit. these expensed costs include:
  fertilization,
  vegetation and insect control,
  pruning and precommercial thinning and
  property taxes.
accounting practices for these costs do not change when timber becomes merchantable and harvesting starts.
timber depletion.to determine depletion rates, we divide the net carrying value of timber by the related volume of timber estimated to be available over the growth cycle. to determine the growth cycle volume of timber, we consider:
  regulatory and environmental constraints,
  our management strategies,
  inventory data improvements,
  growth rate revisions and recalibrations and
  known dispositions and inoperable acres.
in addition, the duration of the harvest cycle varies by geographic region and species of timber.
depletion rate calculations do not include estimates for:
  future silviculture or sustainable forest management costs associated with existing stands;
  future reforestation costs associated with a stand's final harvest and
  future volume in connection with the replanting of a stand subsequent to its final harvest.
we include the cost of timber harvested in the carrying values of raw materials and product inventories. as these inventories are sold to third parties, we include them in costs of sales.
forest management in canada.we manage timberlands under long-term licenses in various canadian provinces that are:
  granted by the provincial governments;
  granted for initial periods of 15 to 25 years and
  renewable provided we meet reforestation, operating and management guidelines.
calculation of the fees we pay on the timber we harvest:
  varies from province to province,
  is tied to product market pricing and
  depends upon the allocation of land management responsibilities in the license.
weyerhaeuser company > 2023 annual report and form 10-k 68
table of contents impairment of long-lived assets we review the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever an event or a change in circumstance indicates that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable through future operations. the carrying value is the original cost, less accumulated depreciation and any past impairments recorded. if we evaluate recoverability, we are required to estimate future cash flows and residual values of the asset or asset group. key assumptions used in developing estimates of future cash flows and residual values could include probability of alternative outcomes, product pricing, raw material cost and product sales. an impairment occurs when the carrying value of a long-lived asset is greater than the amount that could be recovered from the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset and greater than fair market value (the amount we could receive if we were to sell the asset).
impaired assets held for use are written down to fair value, while impaired assets held for sale are written down to fair value less cost to sell. we determine fair value based on:
  appraisals,
  market pricing of comparable assets,
  discounted value of estimated future cash flows from the asset,
  replacement values of comparable assets and
  agreed upon sale price or offer price.
key assumptions used in developing estimates of fair value would include the estimated future cash flows used to assess recoverability, discount rates and probability of alternative outcomes.
items related to financing our business key items related to financing our business include financial instruments, cash equivalents and concentration of risk.
financial instruments we estimate the fair value of financial instruments where appropriate. the assumptions we use
- including the discount rate and estimates of cash flows - can significantly affect the fair value. these values are estimates and may not match the amounts we would realize upon sale or settlement of our financial positions.
cash equivalents cash equivalents are investments with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase. we state cash equivalents at cost, which approximates market.
concentration of risk we disclose customers that represent a concentration of risk. as of december 31, 2023, and december 31, 2022, no customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our net sales.
items related to operations key items related to operations include revenue recognition, inventories, shipping and handling costs, income taxes, pension and other post-employment benefit plans and contingent liabilities.
revenue recognition refer to note 3: revenue recognition for details on how we account for revenue.
inventories we state inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. cost includes labor, materials and production overhead. lifo applies to major inventory products held at our u.s. domestic locations. we began to use the lifo method for domestic products in the 1940s as required to conform with the tax method elected. subsequent acquisitions of entities added new products under the moving average cost or fifo - the first-in, first-out -
methods and those products continue to be recognized under those methods. the moving average cost or fifo method applies to the balance of our domestic raw material and product inventories, all material and supply inventories and all foreign inventories.
shipping and handling costs we classify shipping and handling costs in "costs of sales" in our consolidated statement of operations .
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. unrecognized tax benefits represent potential future funding obligations to taxing authorities if uncertain tax positions we have taken on previously filed tax returns are not sustained. accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense.
weyerhaeuser company > 2023 annual report and form 10-k 69
table of contents we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect:
  future tax consequences due to differences between the carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of certain items and
  net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
to measure deferred tax assets and liabilities, we:
  determine when the differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of affected items are expected to be recovered or resolved and
  use enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in those years.
pension and other post-employment benefit plans we recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit pension and other post-employment benefit plans on ourconsolidated balance sheetand recognize changes in the funded status through comprehensive income
(loss) in the year in which the changes occur.
actuarial valuations determine the amount of the pension and other post-employment benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit cost we recognize. the net periodic benefit cost includes:
  cost of benefits provided in exchange for employees' services rendered during the year;
  interest cost of the obligations;
  expected long-term return on plan assets;

  at the beginning of the year - over the average remaining service period of the active employee group covered by the plans or the average remaining life expectancy in situations where the plan participants are inactive.
pension plans.we have defined benefit pension plans covering approximately40percent of our employees. determination of benefits differs for salaried, hourly and union employees as follows:
  salaried employee benefits are based on each employee's highest monthly earnings for five consecutive years during the final 10 years before retirement.
  hourly and union employee benefits generally are stated amounts for each year of service.
  union employee benefits are set through collective-bargaining agreements.
we contribute to our u.s. and canadian pension plans according to established funding standards. the funding standards for the plans are:
  u.s. pension plans - according to the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and
  canadian pension plans - according to the applicable provincial pension act and the income tax act.
post-employment benefits other than pensions.we provide certain post-employment healthcare and life insurance benefits for some retired employees. in some cases, we pay a portion of the cost of the benefit.note 8: pension and other post-employment benefit plansprovides additional information about our post-employment benefit plans.
estimates for pension and other post-employment benefit plans.estimates we use in accounting for our pension and other post-employment benefit plans include the:
  fair value of our plan assets;
  expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and
  discount rates.
at the end of every year, we review our estimates with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate. we use these estimates to calculate plan asset and liability information as of year-end as well as pension and post-
employment expense for the following year. actual experience that differs from our estimates and subsequent changes in our estimates could have a significant effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
fair value of plan assets.plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plans. the fair value of our plan assets estimates the amount that would be received if we were to sell each asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. we estimate the fair value of these assets based on the information available during the year-end reporting process.

table of contents expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.our expected long-term rate of return is our estimate of the return that our plan assets will earn over time. this rate is used in determining the net periodic benefit or cost we recognize for our plans.
factors we consider in determining our expected long-term rate of return include:
  historical returns for a portfolio of assets similar to our expected allocation and
  expected future performance of similar asset classes.
the actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected long-term rate of return. actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans. differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected long-term rate of return are reflected as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of total equity.
discount rates.discount rates are used to estimate the net present value of our plan obligations. the discount rates are determined at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits.
contingent liabilities we are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to environmental remediation, product and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as the amount or range of potential loss.
we record contingent liabilities when:
  it becomes probable that a loss has been incurred and
  the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
assessing probability of loss and estimating the amount of loss can require analysis of multiple factors, such as:
  historical experience,
  evaluations of relevant legal and environmental authorities and regulations,
  judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts and
  consideration of potential environmental remediation methods.
in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred.
recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value. if estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we record additional charges. these exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flows in any given period. recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when the recovery is deemed probable and does not exceed the amount of losses previously recorded. seenote 13: legal proceedings, commitments and contingenciesfor more information.

note 3: revenue recognition a majority of our revenue is derived from sales of delivered logs and manufactured wood products. we account for revenue in accordance with asc topic 606,revenue from contracts with customers.
performance obligations a performance obligation, as defined in asc topic 606, is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. a contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue at the point in time, or over the period, in which the performance obligation is satisfied. performance obligations associated with delivered log sales are typically satisfied when the logs are delivered to our customers' mills or delivered to an ocean vessel in the case of export sales.
performance obligations associated with the sale of wood products are typically satisfied when the products are shipped. we have elected, as an accounting policy, to treat shipping and handling that is performed after a customer obtains control of the product as an activity required to fulfill the promise to transfer the good;
therefore we will not evaluate this requirement as a separate performance obligation. customers are generally invoiced shortly after logs are delivered or after wood products are shipped, with payment generally due within a month or less of the invoice date. asc topic 606 requires entities to consider significant financing components of contracts with customers, though allows for the use of a practical expedient when the period between satisfaction of a performance obligation and payment receipt is one year or less. given the nature of our revenue transactions, we have elected to utilize this practical expedient. performance obligations associated with real estate sales are generally met when placed into escrow and all conditions of closing have been satisfied. contract estimates substantially all of our performance obligations are satisfied as of a point in time. therefore, there is little judgment in determining when control transfers for our business segments as described above. the transaction price for log sales generally equals the amount billed to our customer for logs delivered during the accounting period.
for the limited number of log sales subject to a long-term supply agreement, the transaction price is variable but is known at the time of billing. for wood products sales, the transaction price is generally the amount billed to the customer for the products shipped but may be reduced slightly for estimated cash discounts and rebates. there are no significant contract estimates related to the real estate business. weyerhaeuser company > 2023 annual report and form 10-k 73 table of contents contract balances in general, customers are billed and a receivable is recorded as we ship and/or deliver wood products and logs. we generally receive payment shortly after products have been received by our customers. contract asset and liability balances are immaterial. for real estate sales, the company receives the entire consideration in cash at closing.

note 8: pension and other post-employment benefit plans this note provides details about defined benefit and defined contribution plans we sponsor for our employees. the
"pension and other post-employment benefit plans" section ofnote 1: summary of significant accounting policiesprovides information about how we account for pension and other post-employment plans and benefits.
plans we sponsor overview of plans the defined benefit pension plans we sponsor in the u.s. and canada differ according to each country's requirements. in the u.s., we have plans that qualify under the internal revenue code (qualified plans), as well as plans for select employees that provide additional benefits not qualified under the internal revenue code
(nonqualified plans). in canada, we have plans that are registered under the income tax act and applicable provincial pension acts (registered plans), as well as nonregistered plans for select employees that provide additional benefits that may not be registered under the income tax act or provincial pension acts (nonregistered plans). we also sponsor other post-employment benefit (opeb) plans in the u.s. and canada, including retiree medical and life insurance plans. our defined benefit pension plans were closed to newly hired and rehired salaried and non-union employees effective january 1, 2014, and were closed to union employees at various dates over the course of 2014 to 2019.
we sponsor various defined contribution plans for our u.s. and canadian salaried and hourly employees. our contributions to these plans were $35million, $31million and $27million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
actions to reduce pension plan obligations as part of our continued efforts to reduce pension plan obligations, we transferred approximately $420million of canadian registered assets and liabilities to insurance companies through the purchase of a group annuity contract in december 2022 (2022 retiree annuity purchase). in connection with this transaction, we recorded a noncash pretax settlement charge of $205million during 2022. this settlement charge accelerated the recognition of previously unrecognized losses in "accumulated other comprehensive loss," that would have been recognized in subsequent periods. given the timing of the 2022 retiree annuity purchase, the plan remeasurement triggered as a result of the transaction was conducted as part of our annual valuation process.

(1) actuarial losses (gains) are primarily due to year-over-year changes in discount rates.
(2) includes adjustments for final fair value of plan assets.
(3) assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet are different from the cumulative income or expense that we have recorded associated with the plans. the differences are actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits that are deferred and amortized into periodic benefit costs in future periods. unamortized amounts are recorded in "accumulated other comprehensive loss", which is a component of total equity on our consolidated balance sheet . the "accumulated other comprehensive loss" section of note 14: shareholders' interest details changes in these amounts by component.
(4) for pension plans with a projected benefit obligation exceeding plan assets, the projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were $ 2.1 billion and $ 1.7 billion at december 31, 2023, respectively, and $ 2.1
billion and $ 1.8 billion at december 31, 2022, respectively. for pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation exceeding plan assets, the accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were $ 2.1
billion and $ 1.7 billion at december 31, 2023, respectively, and $ 2.0 billion and $ 1.8 billion at december 31,
2022, respectively.

(5) for the u.s. defined benefit plans, the discount rate assumption was 5.2 % and 5.4 % for 2023 and 2022, respectively. for the canadian defined benefit plans, the discount rate assumption was 4.7 % and 5.3 % for 2023 and
2022, respectively. for u.s. opeb plans, the discount rate assumption was 5.1 % and 5.4 % for 2023 and 2022, respectively. for canadian opeb plans, the discount rate assumption was 4.6 % and 5.3 % for 2023 and 2022, respectively. for lump sum distributions (for u.s. qualified salaried and nonqualified plans only), the interest and mortality assumptions are the same as those mandated by the pension protection act of 2006 for benefits commencing in the current year.
(6) for the u.s. defined benefit plans, the rate of compensation increase assumption for both 2023 and 2022 was between 2.00 % - 13.00 % for salaried participants and was decreasing with participant age. for the canadian defined benefit plans, the rate of compensation increase assumption was 1.00 % - 2.75 % and 2.00 % - 2.75 % for salaried and hourly participants, respectively, for both 2023 and 2022.
(7) u.s. qualified salaried and nonqualified plans only.
(8) for u.s. opeb plans, the healthcare cost trend rate assumption for the next year for pre-medicare was 7.25 %
and 5.70 % for 2023 and 2022, respectively. the ultimate healthcare cost trend rate was 4.50 % for both 2023 and
2022 and the assumption for the year the ultimate healthcare cost trend rate is reached was 2035 and 2037 in 2023
and 2022, respectively. for canadian opeb plans, the healthcare cost trend rate was 5.13 % for 2023 and 5.20 % for
2022. the ultimate healthcare cost trend rate was 4.00 % and the assumption for the year the ultimate healthcare cost trend rate is reached was 2040 for both 2023 and 2022.
pension assets our investment policies and strategies our investment policies, strategies and advisory agreements guide and direct how the funds are managed for the benefit plans we sponsor. these funds include our:
  u.s. pension trust - funds our u.s. qualified pension plans;
  canadian pension trust - funds our canadian registered pension plans and
  retirement compensation arrangements - fund a portion of our canadian nonregistered pension plans.
u.s. and canadian pension trusts in 2018, we began to shift pension plan assets to an allocation that more closely aligns with our pension plan liability profile. our former investment strategy included investments primarily in hedge funds and private equity funds. these asset classes are now in redemption and run-off mode. however, given the long-term nature of these investments, they will continue to comprise a portion of the plan assets for several years. we expect all investments in redemption to be redeemed at amounts materially consistent with their net asset values (nav). as these investments are redeemed or liquidated, cash proceeds available for investment will be invested in accordance with our current investment strategy.
our investment strategy targets a percentage allocation to growth assets and a percentage allocation to liability hedging assets based on each plan's funded status. we expect to increase the allocation to liability hedging assets over time as the funded status of the pension plans improves. growth assets may include investments in global equities, hedge funds (which are in redemption), private equity assets (which are in run-off mode), fixed income and real estate. liability hedging assets may include corporate credit and government issued fixed income securities as well as treasury futures selected to align with the plan liabilities.
assets within our u.s. and canadian pension trusts were invested as follows:

(1) cash and short-term investments are valued at cost, which approximates market.
(2) public equity investments are valued at exit prices quoted in active markets.
(3) fixed income investments include publicly traded corporate and government issued debt. these bonds have varying maturities, credit quality and sector exposure and are selected to align with the duration of our plan liabilities.
additionally, our fixed income portfolio includes repurchase agreements, which represent short-term borrowings to hedge against interest rate risk. we have an obligation to return the cash related to these borrowings in accordance with the agreements, which are collateralized by our government bonds. fixed income investments are valued at exit prices quoted in active or non-active markets or based on observable inputs.
weyerhaeuser company > 2023 annual report and form 10-k 79

(4) hedge funds and related investments are privately-offered managed pools primarily structured as limited liability entities. general members or partners of these limited liability entities serve as portfolio managers and are thus responsible for the fund's underlying investment decisions. underlying investments within these funds may include long and short public and private equities, corporate, mortgage and sovereign debt, options, swaps, forwards and other derivative positions. these funds have varying degrees of leverage, liquidity and redemption provisions.
(5) these investments are primarily valued based on the navs of the funds. these values represent the per-unit price at which new investors are permitted to invest and existing investors are permitted to exit. when navs as of the end of the year have not been received, we estimate fair value by adjusting the most recently reported navs for market events and cash flows between the interim date and the end of the year.
(6) private equity and related investments include both investments in private equity and investments in mezzanine distressed, co-investments and other structures. private equity funds generally participate in buyout and venture capital strategies through unlisted equity and debt instruments. these funds may also borrow at the underlying entity level. mezzanine and distressed funds generally invest in the debt of public or private companies with additional participation through warrants or other equity options.
(7) derivative instruments have historically been comprised of swaps, futures, forwards or options. at december 31,
2023, only a small amount of risk-mitigating futures remain in the portfolio. derivative instruments are valued based upon valuation statement s received from each derivative's counterparty.
retirement compensation arrangements retirement compensation arrangements fund a portion of our canadian nonregistered pension plans. as required by canadian tax rules, approximately 50 percent of these assets are invested into a non-interest bearing refundable tax account held by the canada revenue agency. this portion of the portfolio does not earn returns. the remaining portion is invested in a portfolio of equities.
managing risk investments and contracts are subject to risks including market price, interest rate, credit, currency and liquidity risks. we mitigate these risks to our pension plan asset portfolios through advisory agreements, investment in diversified portfolios, inclusion of fixed income investments that align with plan liabilities and investment in assets designed to address both currency and liquidity considerations. in addition, we and our investment advisers perform regular monitoring with ongoing qualitative assessments, quantitative assessments and investment and operational due diligence.
valuation of our plan assets pension assets are stated at fair value or nav. fair value is based on the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to settle a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. we consider both observable and unobservable inputs that reflect assumptions applied by market participants when setting the exit price of an asset or liability in an orderly transaction within the principal market for that asset or liability.
we value the pension plan assets based upon the observability of exit pricing inputs and classify pension plan assets based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the pension plan assets in their entirety. refer tonote 1: summary of significant accounting policiesfor details on the fair value hierarchy. the availability of observable market data is monitored to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy. changes in economic conditions or model-based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments from one fair value level to another. in such instances, the transfer is reported at the beginning of the reporting period. we evaluate the significance of transfers between levels based upon the nature of the financial instrument and size of the transfer relative to total net assets available for benefits.
investments for which fair value is measured using the nav per share as a practical expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy.

(1) for the u.s. defined benefit plans, the discount rate assumption was 5.40 %, 2.90 % and 2.50 % for 2023, 2022
and 2021, respectively. for the canadian defined benefit plans, the discount rate assumption was 5.30 %, 3.10 % and
2.50 % for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. for u.s. opeb plans, the discount rate assumption was 5.40 %, 2.60 %
and 2.10 %, for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. for canadian opeb plans, the discount rate assumption was 5.30
%, 3.00 % and 2.40 % for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. for lump sum distributions (for u.s. qualified salaried and nonqualified plans only), the interest and mortality assumptions are the same as those mandated by the pension protection act of 2006 for benefits commencing in the current year.
(2) determining our expected return requires a high degree of judgment. we consider actual pension fund asset performance over multiple years, and current and expected valuation levels in the global equity and credit markets.
historical fund returns are used as a base and we place added weight on more recent pension plan asset performance.
(3) for the u.s. defined benefit plans, the rate of compensation increase assumption for 2023, 2022 and 2021 was between 2.00 % - 13.00 % for salaried participants and was decreasing with participant age. for the canadian defined benefit plans, the rate of compensation increase assumption for salaried participants was 1.00 % - 2.75 %
for 2023 and 3.25 % for 2022 and 2021. the rate of compensation increase assumption for hourly participants was
2.00 % - 2.75 % for 2023 and 3.00 % for 2022 and 2021.
(4) u.s. qualified salaried and nonqualified plans only.
(5) for opeb plans during 2023, the assumed weighted healthcare cost trend rate was 5.70 %, 4.50 % and 5.20 % for u.s. pre-medicare participants, u.s. hra participants and canadian opeb plans, respectively.
pension plan contributions and benefit payments established funding standards govern the funding requirements for our qualified and registered pension plans. we fund the benefit payments of our nonqualified and nonregistered plans as benefit payments come due.
during 2023, we made contributions and/or benefit payments of $12million for our u.s. nonqualified pension plans,
$1million for our canadian nonregistered pension plans and $1million for our canadian registered plans.
during 2024, based on estimated year-end asset values and projections of plan liabilities, we expect to make contributions and/or benefit payments of approximately:
  $10 million for our u.s. nonqualified pension plans,
  $2 million for the canadian non-registered plans and
  $1 million for our canadian registered plan (required contribution).
we do not anticipate contributions being required for our u.s. qualified pension plan for 2024.

union-administered multiemployer benefit plans we contribute to multiemployer defined benefit plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements. these plans cover a small number of our employees and on an annual basis our contributions are immaterial.
these plans have different risks than single-employer plans. our contributions may be used to fund benefits for employees of other participating employers. if we choose to stop participating, we may be required to pay a withdrawal liability based on the underfunded status of the plan.if another participating employer stops contributing to the plan, we may become responsible for remaining plan unfunded obligations.

to estimate the fair value of fixed rate long-term debt, we used the market approach, which is based on quoted market prices we received for the same types and issues of our debt. we believe that our variable-rate long term debt and line of credit instruments have net carrying values that approximate their fair value with only insignificant differences. the inputs to the valuations of our long-term debt are based on market data obtained from independent sources or information derived principally from observable market data. the difference between the fair value and the carrying value represents the theoretical net premium or discount we would pay or receive to retire all debt at the measurement date.
fair value of other financial instruments we believe that our other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, mutual fund investments held in grantor trusts, receivables and payables, have net carrying values that approximate their fair values with only insignificant differences. this is primarily due to the short-term nature of these instruments and the allowance for doubtful accounts.
note 13: legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies this note provides details about our:
  legal proceedings,
  environmental matters and
  commitments and other contingencies.
legal proceedings we are party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. we are not currently a party to any legal proceeding that management believes could have a material adverse effect on ourconsolidated balance sheet,consolidated statement of operationsorconsolidated statement of cash flows.
environmental matters site remediation under the federal comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act (cercla) - commonly known as the "superfund" - and similar state laws, we are a party to various proceedings related to the cleanup of hazardous waste sites and have been notified that we may be a potentially responsible party related to the cleanup of other hazardous waste sites for which proceedings have not yet been initiated.
we have received notification from the environmental protection agency (epa) and have acknowledged that we are a potentially responsible party in a portion of the kalamazoo river superfund site in southwest michigan. our involvement in the remediation site is based on our operation of the plainwell, michigan mill, located within the remediation site, from 1954 to 1970. several other companies also have been deemed potentially responsible parties as past or present owners or operators of facilities within the site, or as arrangers under cercla.
we cooperated with other parties to jointly implement an administrative order issued by the epa on april 14, 2016, with respect to a portion of the site comprising a stretch of the river approximately 1.7 miles long referred to as the otsego township dam area. during third quarter 2018, implementation of this administrative order was completed.
in 2010, the company, along with others, was named as a defendant by georgia-pacific consumer products lp, fort james corporation and georgia-pacific llc in an action seeking contribution under cercla for remediation costs relating to a certain area within the site. on march 29, 2018, the u.s. district court issued an opinion and order assigning the company responsibility for5percent of approximately $50million in past costs incurred by the plaintiffs. the remaining95percent of this pool of past costs incurred was allocated to the plaintiffs and other defendants. the opinion and order does not establish allocation for future remediation costs, and accordingly, we may incur additional costs in connection with future remediation tasks for other areas of the site.
weyerhaeuser company > 2023 annual report and form 10-k 86
table of contents in 2022, the sixth circuit court of appeals reversed the district court opinion, finding that georgia-pacific's claims for cost contributions were time barred by the statute of limitations. georgia-pacific filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the u.s. supreme court, which was denied during fourth quarter 2023 and redirected to the district court for further proceedings. as a result, georgia-pacific relinquished further appeals and the company was found not responsible for prior costs incurred by georgia-pacific.
we have established accruals for estimated remediation costs on the active superfund sites and other sites for which we are a potentially responsible party. these accruals are recorded in "accrued liabilities" and "other liabilities" on ourconsolidated balance sheet.

we change our accrual to reflect:
  new information on any site concerning implementation of remediation alternatives,
  updates on prior cost estimates and new sites and
  costs incurred to remediate sites.
estimates.we believe it is reasonably possible, based on currently available information and analysis, that remediation costs for all identified sites may exceed our existing accruals by up to $213million. this estimate, in which those additional costs may be incurred over several years, is the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs. the estimate:
  is much less certain than the estimates on which our accruals currently are based and
  uses assumptions that are less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes.
in estimating our current accruals and the possible range of additional future costs, we:
  assumed we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of every site,
  took into account the ability of other potentially responsible parties to participate and
  considered each party's financial condition and probable contribution on a per-site basis.
we have not recorded any amounts for potential recoveries from insurance carriers.
asset retirement obligations we have obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets consisting primarily of reforestation obligations related to forest management licenses in canada and obligations to close and cap landfills. some of our sites have asbestos containing materials. we have met our current legal obligation to identify and manage these materials. in situations where we cannot reasonably determine when asbestos containing materials might be removed from the sites, we have not recorded an accrual because the fair value of the obligation cannot be reasonably estimated. as of december 31, 2023, and december 31, 2022, we had an asset retirement obligation of$36millionand $32million, respectively.these obligations are recorded in "accrued liabilities" and

  how we account for share-based awards,
  tax benefits of share-based awards,
  types of share-based compensation,
  unrecognized share-based compensation and
  deferred compensation stock equivalent units.
share-based compensation expense was:
  $36 million in 2023,
  $33 million in 2022 and
  $30 million in 2021.
weyerhaeuser company > 2023 annual report and form 10-k 89
table of contents our long-term incentive compensation plan our long-term incentive plan provides for share-based awards that include:
  restricted stock,
  restricted stock units (rsus),
  performance shares and
  performance share units (psus).
we may issue future grants of up to21million shares under the 2022 plan. we also have the right to reissue forfeited and expired grants. the compensation committee of our board of directors annually establishes an overall pool of stock awards available for grants based on performance.
for stock-settled awards, we issue new stock into the marketplace and generally do not repurchase shares in connection with issuance of new awards.
our common shares would increase by approximately25million shares if all share-based awards were exercised or vested. these include:
  all outstanding share-based awards at december 31, 2023 and
  all remaining rsus and psus that could be granted under the 2022 plan.
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
how we account for share-based awards we recognize the cost of share-based awards using a fair-value-based measurement in ourconsolidated statement of operationsover the required service period - generally the period from the date of the grant to the date when it is fully vested. special situations include:
  awards that vest upon retirement - the required service period ends on the date an employee is eligible for retirement, including early retirement.
  awards that continue to vest following job elimination or the sale of a business - the required service period ends on the date the employment from the company is terminated.
in these special situations, compensation expense from share-based awards is recognized over a period that is shorter than the stated vesting period. forfeitures are recognized in compensation expense as they occur.
tax benefits of share-based awards our total income tax benefit from share-based awards recognized in ourconsolidated statement of operationsfor the last three years was:
  $5 million in 2023,
  $5 million in 2022 and
  $4 million in 2021.
tax benefits from share-based awards are accrued as stock compensation expense and realized when restricted shares, performance shares, rsus and psus vest.
types of share-based compensation our share-based compensation is in the form of rsus and psus.
restricted stock units through the 2022 plan, we award rsus - grants that entitle the holder to shares of our stock as the award vests.
the details our rsus granted in 2023, 2022 and 2021 generally:
  vest ratably over four years;
  immediately vest in the event of death or disability while employed;
continue to vest upon retirement at an age of at least 62, in accordance with the vesting terms of the
  awards, but a portion of the award is forfeited if retirement occurs before the one-year anniversary of the grant;
  continue vesting for one year in the event of involuntary termination due to job elimination;
immediately vest in the case of a change of control, if the successor company does not assume the award or,
  if assumed, within two years of the effective date of the change in control the recipient is terminated other than for cause or leaves for good reason (as defined in the award terms and conditions) and
  will be forfeited upon termination of employment in all other situations including early retirement prior to age 62.
our accounting the fair value of our rsus is the market price of our stock on the grant date of the awards.
weyerhaeuser company > 2023 annual report and form 10-k 90
table of contents we generally record share-based compensation expense for rsus over the four-year vesting period. generally, for rsus that continue to vest following the termination of employment, we record the share-based compensation expense over a required service period that is less than the stated vesting period.

(1) as of december 31, 2023, there were approximately 136 thousand rs us that had met the requisite service period and will be released as identified in the grant terms.
the weighted average grant-date fair value for rsus was:
  $33.81 in 2023,
  $42.02 in 2022 and
  $33.62 in 2021.
the total grant-date fair value of rsus vested was:
  $22 million in 2023,
  $22 million in 2022 and
  $25 million in 2021.
nonvested rsus accrue dividends that are paid out when rsus vest. any rsus forfeited will not receive dividends.
as rsus vest, a portion of the shares awarded is withheld to cover employee taxes. as a result, the number of stock units vested and the number of common shares issued will differ.
performance share units through the 2022 plan, we award psus - grants that entitle the holder to shares of our stock as the award vests.
the details the final number of shares granted in 2023, 2022 and 2021 will vest between a range of0percent to150percent of each grant's target, depending upon actual company total shareholder return (tsr) compared against the tsr of an industry peer group. tsr assumes full reinvestment of dividends.
the vesting provisions for psus granted in 2023, 2022 and 2021 were generally as follows:
awards granted in 2021 vest 100 percent on the third anniversary of the grant date, and awards granted in
  2022 and in 2023 vest on march 1st following the end of the performance period, in each case as long as the individual remains employed by the company;
  in the event of death or disability while employed, awards continue to be earned and settled based on actual company performance;
upon retirement at an age of at least 62, awards continue to vest in accordance with the vesting terms of
  the award, but a portion of the award is forfeited if retirement occurs before the one-year anniversary of the grant;
  awards continue vesting for one year in the event of involuntary termination due to job elimination and the second anniversary of the grant date has passed;
in the case of a change of control during the performance period, awards are deemed earned at target performance and (i) vest as of the change of control date if the successor company does not assume the award
  or (ii) if assumed, vest upon termination of employment if, within two years of the effective date of the change in control, the recipient is involuntarily terminated other than for cause or leaves for good reason
(as defined in the award terms and conditions);
  awards will be forfeited upon termination of employment in all other situations including early retirement prior to age 62 and
  awards vest at a maximum of 100 percent of target value in the event of negative absolute company tsr.
weyerhaeuser company > 2023 annual report and form 10-k 91
table of contents our accounting since the awards contain a market condition, the effect of the market condition is reflected in the grant-date fair value which is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model. this model estimates the tsr ranking of the company over the performance period. compensation expense is based on the estimated probable number of earned awards and recognized over the vesting period on an accelerated basis. generally, compensation expense would not be reversed if the market condition is not achieved, provided the requisite service period has been completed.

(1) as of december 31, 2023, there were approximately 33 thousand psus that had met the requisite service period and will be released as identified in the grant terms.
the total grant-date fair value of psus vested was:
  $8 million in 2023,
  $12 million in 2022 and
  $8 million in 2021.
nonvested psus accrue dividends that are paid out when psus vest. any psus forfeited will not receive dividends.
as psus vest, a portion of the shares awarded is withheld to cover participant taxes. as a result, the number of share units vested and the number of common shares issued will differ.
unrecognized share-based compensation as of december 31, 2023, our unrecognized share-based compensation cost for all types of share-based awards included $53million related to non-vested equity-classified share-based compensation arrangements. these are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately2.1years.
deferred compensation stock equivalent units certain employees and our board of directors may defer compensation into stock equivalent units.
the details eligible employees:
  may choose to defer all or part of their bonus into stock equivalent units;
  may choose to defer part of their salary, except for executive officers and
  receive a 15 percent premium if the deferral is for at least five years.
our directors:
  receive a portion of their annual retainer fee in the form of rsus, which vest over one year and may be deferred into stock equivalent units;
weyerhaeuser company > 2023 annual report and form 10-k 92

  may choose to defer some or all of the remainder of their annual retainer fee into stock equivalent units and
  do not receive a premium for their deferrals.
employees and directors also choose when the deferrals will be paid out, although no deferrals may be paid until after the separation from service of the employee or director.
our accounting we settle all deferred compensation accounts in cash for our employees. our directors receive shares of common stock as payment for stock equivalent units, except that any directors who are subject to federal or provincial taxation in canada have the choice to receive a cash amount equal to the fair market value of the company's common stock on the date of payment. in addition, we credit all stock equivalent accounts with dividend equivalents. the number of common shares to be issued in the future to directors is514thousand as of december 31, 2023.
stock equivalent units are liability-classified awards and remeasured to fair value at every reporting date.
the fair value of a stock equivalent unit is equal to the market price of our stock.
activity the number of stock equivalent units outstanding in our deferred compensation accounts was:
  530 thousand as of december 31, 2023,
  595 thousand as of december 31, 2022 and

  712 thousand as of december 31, 2021.
note 16: leases the majority of our operating leases are related to our office and warehouse space, and the majority of our financing leases are related to vehicles and forklifts. our leases have remaining lease terms of approximately1yearto25years. options to renew, extend or terminate a lease are reflected in our lease terms when we believe it is reasonably certain we will exercise that option. when our leases do not provide an implicit or an explicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments.

definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) related to the year ended december 31, 2021, refer to this same section in our 2022 annual report on form 10-k as filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 17, 2023.
economic and market conditions affecting our operations our market conditions and the strength of the broader u.s. economy are, and will continue to be, influenced by the trajectory of activity in the u.s. housing and repair and remodel segments, inflation trends and interest rates.
the demand for sawlogs within our timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. the strength of the u.s. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our wood products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the u.s., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products.
our timberlands segment, specifically the western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy.
japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in japan. the demand for pulpwood from our timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (osb)
weyerhaeuser company >2023 annual report and form 10-k43
table of contents as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. our timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. in general, western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while southern log markets have more available supply. however, additional mill capacity being added in the u.s. south has led to tightening of markets in certain geographies. our real estate, energy and natural resources segment is affected by a variety of factors, including the general state of the economy, local real estate market conditions, the level of construction activity in the u.s. and evolution of emerging renewable energy and carbon-related markets.
over the past year, particularly in the first half of 2023, home sales and building activity slowed due in part to higher mortgage interest rates, reduced affordability and general macroeconomic conditions. in the latter part of
2023, new home sales and construction activity strengthened, supported by near record-low levels of existing inventory. on a seasonally adjusted annual basis, as reported by the u.s. census bureau, housing starts for fourth quarter 2023 averaged 1.5 million units, a 6.1 percent increase from third quarter 2023. single-family starts averaged1.0 million units in fourth quarter 2023, a 7.7 percent increase from third quarter 2023. multi-family starts averaged412thousand units in fourth quarter 2023, which was a 2.2 percent increase from third quarter 2023.
single-family construction is the primary driver for our business as compared to multi-family due to the amount of wood products used. sales of newly built, single-family homes averaged a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 652
thousand units for fourth quarter 2023, a decrease of 6.0 percent from third quarter 2023. over the medium to long-
term, we expect a favorable u.s. housing construction market supported by strong demographics in the key homebuying age cohorts, a decade of underbuilding and a historically low housing inventory.
repair and remodeling expenditures were steady from third quarter 2023 to fourth quarter 2023 according to the census bureau advance retail spending report. do-it-yourself activity has been returning to more normalized levels while professionally contracted activities have benefited from larger projects and increases in home equity levels.
over the longer term, we expect this sector to return to pre-pandemic growth trends with healthy household balance sheets, elevated home equity and an aging u.s. housing stock, with a median age of 43 years.
in u.s. wood product markets, demand for lumber and osb was influenced by cautious buyer sentiment at the outset of fourth quarter 2023. as the quarter progressed, demand increased in response to strong single-family housing starts and improving macroeconomic conditions. the random lengths framing lumber composite price averaged $384/mbf and the osb composite averaged $406/msf in fourth quarter 2023. over the course of the fourth quarter, composite prices for lumber decreased from $422/mbf to $395/mbf and composite prices for osb decreased from $454/msf to $430/msf.
in western log markets, douglas fir sawlog prices decreased 2.8 percent in fourth quarter 2023 compared with third quarter 2023, as reported by fastmarkets risi log lines based on weyerhaeuser's sales mix. overall, domestic log demand and prices faced downward pressure at the outset of the quarter, as mills adjusted to a softening lumber market and worked through elevated log inventories. as the quarter progressed, lumber markets improved, and log supply decreased seasonally. in the south, delivered sawlog prices decreased 0.5 percent in fourth quarter 2023
compared to third quarter 2023 and declined 3.6 percent from fourth quarter 2022 as reported by timbermart-south.
this was primarily driven by ample log supply, elevated mill inventories and reduced demand for finished goods during the quarter.
currency exchange rates, available supply from other countries and trade policy affect our export businesses.
during fourth quarter 2023, end use demand in export markets was mixed. in japan, total housing starts decreased
4.7 percent year to date through november compared to the same period in 2022, while the key post and beam segmentsaw a 6.2 percent decrease. lumber imports to japan from europe were more balanced than in previous quarters, providing support for logs. china's weaker end use demand for logs and lumber was offset by lower competitive supply, leading to stable pricing for logs from the west.
interest rates affect our business primarily through their impact on mortgage rates and housing affordability, their general impact on the economy and their influence on our capital management activities. actions by the u.s.
federal reserve, the overall condition of the economy and fluctuations in financial markets are all factors that influence long-term interest rates. 30-year mortgage rates, which are correlated with long-term interest rates, decreased from 7.3 percent at the end of third quarter 2023 to 6.6 percent at the end of fourth quarter 2023, according to economic data from freddie mac. many builders have been able to offset higher mortgage rates through discounts, mortgage rate buydowns and modifying product offerings such as home sizes and finishes. higher rates have also locked-in many existing homeowners from selling, reducing inventories of existing homes for sale which has led to increased demand for available new homes.
increased inflation affects the cost of our operations across each of our business segments, including costs for raw materials, transportation, energy and labor. the consumer price index increased at an annual rate of 3.4
percent as of december 2023, which is markedly down from its peak of over 9.0 percent annual increase in june 2022.
while we can offset some of the impacts of inflation through our sales activities, our operational excellence initiatives and our procurement practices, not all of the costs associated with inflation can be fully mitigated or passed on to the consumer.
the condition of the labor market affects all of our businesses as it relates to our ability to attract and retain employees and contractors. the unemployment rate of 3.7 percent in december 2023 remained near historically low levels and decreased 0.1 percent from the end of third quarter 2023.
governments and businesses across the globe are taking action on climate change and are making significant commitments towards decarbonizing operations and reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero. achieving these commitments will require governments and companies to take major steps to modify operations, invest in low-carbon activities and purchase credits to reduce environmental impacts. we believe we are uniquely positioned to help entities achieve these commitments through natural climate solutions, including forest carbon sequestration, carbon capture and storage and renewable energy activities.

net sales net sales decreased $2,510 million - 25 percent - primarily due to a $2,301 million decrease in wood products net sales to unaffiliated customers attributable to decreased sales realizations and sales volumes across most product lines, as well as a $204 million decrease in timberlands net sales to unaffiliated customers attributable to decreased log sales realizations in the western region.
costs of sales costs of sales decreased $572 million - 9 percent - primarily due to decreased sales volumes across most product lines and decreased raw material prices within our wood products segment, as well as decreased third-party log purchases within our timberlands segment.
operating income operating income decreased $1,894 million - 61 percent - primarily due to a $1,938 million decrease in consolidated gross margin (see discussion of components above), partially offset by an $84 million gain on sale of timberlands
(refer tonote 4: timberland acquisitions and divestitures).
net earnings net earnings decreased $1,041 million - 55 percent - primarily due to the $1,894 million decrease in operating income discussed above.
this decrease was partially offset by:
  a $327 million decrease in income tax expense (refer to income taxes);
  a $276 million decrease in debt extinguishment charges (refer to note 11: long-term debt, net);
  a $209 million decrease in non-operating pension and other post-employment benefit costs (refer to note 8:
pension and other post-employment benefit plans) and a $51 million increase in interest income and other attributable to interest earned on short-term
  investments held for a portion of the year in 2023 and an increase in the interest rate on our cash and investment accounts.

net charge to earnings decreased by $240 million - 56 percent - primarily due to a $209 million decrease in non-
operating pension and other post-employment benefit costs attributable to a $205 million pension settlement charge recorded in fourth quarter 2022 (refer tonote 8: pension and other post-employment benefit plans), as well as a $51
million increase in interest income and other attributable to interest earned on short-term investments held for a portion of the year in 2023 and an increase in the interest rate on our cash and investment accounts.

  $280 million in 2023 and
  $270 million in 2022.
interest expense increased by $10 million compared to 2022 primarily due to the may 2023 issuance of debt securities that increased our weighted average outstanding debt.

  $98 million in 2023 and
  $425 million in 2022.
income tax expense decreased by $327 million compared to 2022 primarily due to decreases in our pretax earnings and effective income tax rate. during 2022, we recorded a $69 million tax benefit in connection with our early debt retirement and a $53 million tax benefit related to our noncash pension settlement charge.

liquidity and capital resources we are committed to maintaining an appropriate capital structure that provides financial flexibility and enables us to protect the interests of our shareholders and meet our obligations to our lenders, while also maintaining access to all major financial markets. as of december 31, 2023, we had $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.5
billion of availability on our line of credit, which expires in march 2028. we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future.
cash from operations consolidated net cash from operations was:
  $1,433 million in 2023 and
  $2,832 million in 2022.
comparing 2023 with 2022
net cash from operations decreased by $1,399 million, primarily due to decreased cash inflows from our business operations. this change was partially offset by a $503 million decrease in our cash paid for income taxes.
pension contributions and benefit payments made and expected during 2023, we contributed a total of $20 million to our pension and post-employment benefit plans, compared to a total of $24 million during 2022.
for 2024, we expect to contribute approximately $20 million to our pension and post-employment benefit plans. refer tonote 8: pension and other post-employment benefit plansfor further information.

  future economic conditions,
  environmental regulations,
  changes in the composition of our business,
  weather,
  timing of equipment purchases and
  capital needs related to other business opportunities.
financing cash from financing activities includes items such as:
  issuances and payments of debt,
  borrowings and payments on our revolving line of credit and
  payments for cash dividends and repurchasing stock.
consolidated net cash from financing activities was:
  $(1,342) million in 2023 and
  $(2,491) million in 2022.
comparing 2023 with 2022
net cash from financing activities increased by $1,149 million in 2023, primarily due to:
  a $412 million decrease in cash used for repurchases of common stock;
  a $401 million decrease in cash paid for dividends and
  a $336 million decrease in net cash used for payments on long-term debt.
long-term debt our consolidated long-term debt (including current portion) was:
  $5,069 million as of december 31, 2023 and
  $5,053 million as of december 31, 2022.
the increase in our long-term debt during 2023 is primarily attributable to the may 2023 issuance of $750 million of 4.750 percent notes and the december 2023 issuance of a $250 million senior unsecured term loan, offset by the december 2023 repayment of our $860 million 5.207 percent note and the july 2023 repayment of our $118 million
7.125 percent notes.
the weighted average interest rate and the weighted average maturity on our long-term debt as of december 31, 2023
were 5.35 percent and 7.6 years, respectively.

line of credit in march 2023, we entered into a new $1.5 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in march 2028 and replaced the existing facility which was set to expire in january 2025. borrowings will bear interest at a floating rate based on either the adjusted term secured overnight financing rate (sofr) plus a spread or a mutually agreed upon base rate plus a spread. as of december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility and we were in compliance with the revolving credit facility covenants.
weyerhaeuser company >2023 annual report and form 10-k52
table of contents our covenants our key covenants include the requirement to maintain:
  a minimum total adjusted shareholders' equity of $3.0 billion and
  a defined debt-to-total-capital ratio of 65 percent or less.
our total adjusted shareholders' equity is comprised of:
  total shareholders' equity,
  excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),
  minus our investment in our unrestricted subsidiaries.
our capitalization is comprised of:
  total debt,
  plus total adjusted shareholders' equity.
as of december 31, 2023, we had:
  total adjusted shareholders' equity of $10.5 billion and
  a defined debt-to-total-capital ratio of 32.5 percent.

there are no other significant financial debt covenants related to our third-party debt.
credit ratings as of december 31, 2023, our long-term issuer credit rating was bbb and baa2 from s&p and moody's, respectively.
dividends we paid cash dividends on common shares of:
  $1,216 million in 2023 and
  $1,617 million in 2022.
the decrease in dividends paid is primarily due to a supplemental dividend of $0.90 per share based on 2022
financial results for a total of $660 million paid in first quarter 2023 in comparison to a supplemental dividend of $1.45 per share based on 2021 financial results for a total of $1,084 million paid in first quarter 2022.
on january 25, 2024, our board of directors declared a supplemental dividend of $0.14 per share based on 2023
financial results. the dividend is payable on february 27, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on february 16, 2024.
we plan to supplement our base dividend each year with an additional return of cash, in the form of a supplemental cash dividend and/or share repurchase, to achieve our targeted annual payout of total cash to shareholders of 75 to
80 percent of adjusted funds available for distribution (adjusted fad). for further information on adjusted fad seeperformance and liquidity measures.

obligations(3)
amounts presented for interest payments assume that all long-term debt obligations outstanding as of december 31,
2023 will remain outstanding until maturity.
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction. purchase obligations exclude arrangements that the company can cancel without penalty.
the timing of certain payments within this category will be triggered by retirements or other events. these payments can include workers compensation, deferred compensation and banked vacation, among other obligations. when the timing of payment is uncertain, the amounts are included in the total column only. minimum pension funding is required by established funding standards and estimates are not made for 2025 onward. estimated payments of contractually obligated post-employment benefits are not included due to the uncertainty of payment timing.
off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements have not had - and are not reasonably likely to have - a material effect on our current or future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.note 10: line of creditcontains our disclosures of surety bonds and letters of credit.
environmental matters, legal proceedings and other contingencies seenote 13: legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies.
accounting matters critical accounting estimates in the preparation of our financial statements we follow established accounting policies and make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. we base our judgments and estimates on historical experience and assumptions we believe are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances. actual results, however, could differ materially from the estimated amounts we have recorded. some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. accounting policies whose application involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and may have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition are considered critical accounting estimates.
discount rates for pension and post-employment benefit plans discount rates are used to estimate the net present value of our pension and other post-employment plan obligations. these rates are determined at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits. the selection of discount rates requires judgment as well as the involvement of actuarial specialists. these specialists assist with selecting yield curves based on published indices for high-quality corporate bonds and projecting the timing and amount of cash flows associated with our obligations to ultimately support our determination of an appropriate discount rate for each plan.
our discount rates as of december 31, 2023 are:
  5.2 percent for our u.s. pension plans - compared with 5.4 percent at december 31, 2022;
  5.1 percent for our u.s. post-employment benefit plans - compared with 5.4 percent at december 31, 2022;
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  4.7 percent for our canadian pension plans - compared with 5.3 percent at december 31, 2022 and
  4.6 percent for our canadian post-employment benefit plans - compared with 5.3 percent at december 31, 2022.
pension expenses for 2024 will be based on the 5.2 percent and 4.7 percent assumed discount rates for the u.s.
pension plans and the canadian pension plans, respectively, and the 5.1 percent and 4.6 percent assumed discount rates for the u.s. and canadian post-employment benefit plans, respectively.

performance and liquidity measures we use adjusted ebitda as a key performance measure to evaluate the performance of the consolidated company and our business segments. this measure should not be considered in isolation from, and is not intended to represent an alternative to, our results reported in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap).
however, we believe adjusted ebitda provides meaningful supplemental information for our investors about our operating performance, better facilitates period to period comparisons and is widely used by analysts, lenders, rating agencies and other interested parties. our definition of adjusted ebitda may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies. adjusted ebitda, as we define it, is operating income adjusted for depreciation, depletion, amortization, basis of real estate sold and special items.

special items we use adjusted funds available for distribution (adjusted fad) to evaluate the company's liquidity and measure cash generated during the period (net of capital expenditures and significant nonrecurring items) that is available for dividends, repurchases of common shares, debt reduction, acquisitions, and other discretionary and nondiscretionary capital allocation activities. adjusted fad should not be considered in isolation from, and is not intended to represent an alternative to, results reported in accordance with u.s. gaap. however, we believe the measure provides meaningful supplemental information for our investors about our liquidity. adjusted fad, as we define it, is net cash from operations adjusted for capital expenditures and significant non-recurring items. our definition of adjusted fad may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies, including those in our industry. we reconcile adjusted fad to net cash from operations, as that is the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measure.

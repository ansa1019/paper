item 1a. risk factors.
for a business as large and globally diverse as the company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report and our other filings with the sec, we believe the most significant risk factors affecting our business include the following:
business, operational and industry risks the quick service restaurant ("qsr") pizza category and the food service and food delivery markets in general are highly competitive and such competition could adversely affect our operating results.
in the u.s., we compete primarily against regional and independent or local companies as well as national chains pizza hut®, papa john's® and little caesars pizza®. internationally, we compete primarily with pizza hut®, papa john's® and country-specific national, regional and independent or local companies. we may experience increased competition from existing or new companies in the delivery and carryout pizza categories, in addition to competition from order and delivery aggregators both in the pizza category and more broadly, that may create increasing pressures to grow our business in order to maintain our market share. competition for both customers and drivers from these order and delivery aggregators and other food delivery services has substantially increased as order and delivery aggregators have grown in size and scale. additionally, we face competition from supermarkets and meal kit and food delivery providers, with the improvement of prepared food and meal kit offerings, expansion in meal delivery platforms and services and the trend towards convergence in grocery, deli, retail and restaurant services.
we also compete more broadly with qsrs and other international, national, regional and independent or local restaurants. the overall food service market, food delivery market and the qsr market are intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price, service, image, convenience and concept, and are often affected by changes in:
•consumer tastes;
•international, national, regional or local economic conditions;
•marketing, advertising and pricing, including both price increases and discounting;
•disposable purchasing power and demographic trends; and
•currency fluctuations and geopolitical considerations related to international operations.
we compete within the food service market and the qsr market not only for customers, but also for management and hourly employees, including store team members, drivers and qualified franchisees, as well as suitable real estate sites. we and our franchisees have faced an increasingly competitive labor market in recent years due to labor shortages and increased turnover at times resulting in part from the covid-19 pandemic which caused us and our franchisees to in certain cases make operational changes and delay store openings which could ultimately impact our growth and competitive position. while the company saw an increase in sales in certain markets, including within the u.s., at times during the covid-19 pandemic, including higher sales related to heightened reliance on delivery and carryout businesses, future sales are not possible to estimate, and it is unclear what sales will be as consumer behavior and general economic and business activity move on from the covid-19 pandemic. our success is also dependent in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance the goodwill and reputation of our brand, our customers' connection to our brand, and a positive relationship with our franchisees and the communities in which we and our franchisees operate.
our supply chain segment is also subject to competition from outside suppliers. while substantially all u.s. franchisees purchased food, equipment and supplies from us in 2023, u.s. franchisees are not required to purchase food, equipment or supplies from us and they may choose to purchase from outside suppliers. if other suppliers who meet our qualification standards were to offer lower prices or better service to our franchisees for their ingredients and supplies and, as a result, our franchisees chose not to purchase from our u.s. supply chain centers, our financial condition, business and results of operations would be adversely affected.
if we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, lower demand for our products, reduced margins, loss of management or hourly employees, reduced service levels, disruption in our supply chain, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share, all of which would have an adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our stock price to decline.
if we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy, which includes opening new stores and generating more sales, our ability to increase our revenues and operating profits could be adversely affected.
a significant component of our growth strategy includes the opening of new u.s. (both company-owned as well as franchised stores) and international franchised stores. we and our franchisees face many challenges in opening new stores, including, among others:
•construction, permitting or development delays;
•employment and training of qualified personnel, including availability of store team members;
•selection and availability of suitable new store sites and the ability to renew leases in quality locations;
•availability and negotiation of leases and financing with acceptable terms;
•securing required u.s. or foreign governmental permits, licenses and approvals; and
•general economic and business conditions, including increases in food costs, build costs and labor costs which could impact profitability and demand for new stores.
the opening of additional franchise stores also depends, in part, upon the availability of suitable prospective franchisees who meet our criteria, the ability of these franchisees to attract and retain qualified personnel and their desire to open new stores and ability to operate those stores effectively. our failure to add new stores would adversely affect our ability to increase revenues and operating income. additionally, our growth strategy and the success of new stores depend in large part on the availability of suitable store sites and leases. we and our franchisees are currently planning to expand our u.s. and international operations in many of the markets where we currently operate and in select new markets. this may require considerable management time as well as start-up expenses for market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated. operations in new markets may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable, and expansion in existing markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions. in addition, we expect to continue our strategy of building additional stores in markets and regions where we have existing stores, a strategy we refer to as "fortressing," which may negatively impact sales at existing stores. therefore, as we continue to expand, we or our franchisees may not experience the gross margins we expect, our results of operations may be negatively impacted, and our stock price may decline. additionally, we have an equity investment in dpc dash ltd ("dpc dash"), as further discussed elsewhere in this report. through its subsidiaries, dpc dash serves as the company's master franchisee in china that owns and operates domino's pizza stores in that market. these types of investments are inherently risky. if dpc dash does not succeed or is unable to successfully execute its growth strategy, we could lose some or all of our investment value.
as part of our growth strategy, we may decide to increase or decrease the number of company-owned stores, either by refranchising existing company-owned stores or by purchasing existing franchised stores, as we have done in the past. our failure to successfully execute these transactions could have an adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our stock price to decline.
another component of our growth strategy also involves our recent entry into the third-party order aggregator marketplace. this new avenue for sales may prove to be unsuccessful and sales may not meet our expectations. our presence on the order aggregator marketplace also introduces us to additional risks and uncertainties including the risk that orders on this marketplace may not have the same level of store-level profitability as orders through our owned channels. our operating results and stock price may be adversely affected if we are not successful on order aggregator platforms.
increases in food, labor and other costs, labor shortages or negative economic conditions could adversely affect our profitability and operating results.
given the present inflationary environment, which we anticipate may continue, there has been and may continue to be significant increases in food costs and labor costs, which have impacted and could further impact our profitability and that of our franchisees and which could impact the opening of new u.s. and international franchised stores and adversely affect our operating results. economic conditions, including the inflationary pressures seen in recent years, may also impact the discretionary purchasing power of our customers, especially customers with less disposable income or for whom discretionary spending represents a smaller portion of their disposable income, resulting in decreased demand for our products. matters having a broad global economic impact may also significantly impact particular costs, such as the impact of geopolitical conflict on our and our international master franchisees' transportation and energy costs. health epidemics or pandemics - such as the global outbreak of covid-19 in early 2020 - have in the past and may in the future impact macroeconomic conditions, consumer behavior, labor availability and supply chain management, as well as local operations in impacted markets. while there historically has been some level of ordinary course turnover of employees, the covid-19 pandemic and its effects exacerbated labor shortages and increased turnover in recent years.
labor shortages and increased turnover rates within our team members and the employees of our franchisees have led to and could in the future lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain team members and could negatively affect our and our franchisees' ability to efficiently operate our respective businesses and result in a negative impact on service and customer experience.
factors such as inflation, increased food costs, increased labor and employee health and benefit costs, increased rent costs, increased transportation costs and increased energy costs may adversely affect our operating costs and profitability and those of our franchisees and could result in menu price increases, which could impact consumer demand. an economic environment characterized by high unemployment, high interest rates, cautious consumer spending, or changes in consumer practices due to a possible recession could also impact consumer spending or demand and our operating results. most of the factors affecting costs are beyond our control and, in many cases, we may not be able to pass along these increased costs to our customers or franchisees and to the extent we were to raise menu prices to offset these costs, could result in decreased consumer demand, sales and profitability.
most ingredients used in our pizza, particularly cheese, are subject to significant price fluctuations as a result of seasonality, weather, demand and other factors. for example, we have experienced increased volatility in prices for some ingredients in recent years. cheese is a significant cost to us, representing approximately 25% of the market basket purchased by our company-owned stores.
additionally, while we strive to engage in a competitive bidding process for our ingredients, because certain of these ingredients, including meat products, may only be available from a limited number of vendors, we may not always be able to do so effectively. furthermore, if we need to seek new suppliers, including as a result of expiration of existing supply agreements, we may be subject to pricing or other terms less favorable to us than those reflected in our current supply arrangements. labor costs are largely a function of the minimum wage for a majority of our and our franchisees' store personnel and certain supply chain center personnel and, generally, are also a function of the availability of labor. in addition to the increases in labor costs described above, several jurisdictions in which we and our franchisees operate have recently approved minimum wage increases. federal, state and local proposals that increase minimum wage requirements or mandate other employee matters could, to the extent implemented, materially increase labor and other costs. as more jurisdictions implement minimum wage increases, we expect that labor costs will continue to increase. for example, labor and regulatory compliance costs could be adversely impacted as a result of california assembly bill no. 1228 (ab 1228), which was signed into law in september 2023 and which will raise the minimum wage for employees of restaurants that are part of a national fast food chain effective april 1, 2024. the increased labor costs at franchised restaurants in california could impact their profitability and the desire to open new stores or renew the franchise agreements for existing stores and result in price increases, which could impact demand for our products or lead to operational changes. further, this bill could prompt similar legislation in other states or localities. the advent of legislation aimed at predictive scheduling may impact labor for our stores and our franchisees' stores. additionally, while we do not currently have any unionized employees, certain employees of other companies in our industry have recently become unionized. if a significant portion of our or our franchisees' employees were to become unionized, our and our franchisees' labor costs could increase and our business could be negatively affected by other union requirements that increase costs, disrupt our business, reduce flexibility and impact employee culture. further, our responses to any union organizing efforts could negatively impact how our brand is perceived. labor costs and food costs, including cheese, generally represent approximately 55% to 65% of the sales at a typical company-owned store.
shortages, interruptions or disruptions in the supply or delivery of fresh food products and store equipment could adversely affect our operating results.
we and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of food products that meet our specifications as well as adequate supply of store equipment. we have single suppliers or a limited number of suppliers for certain of our ingredients, including pizza cheese and meat toppings. while we believe there are adequate reserve quantities and potential alternative suppliers, shortages, interruptions, or disruptions in the supply of food products and store equipment caused by increased demand, capacity constraints, expiration of existing agreements, problems in production or distribution, product recalls, financial or other difficulties of suppliers, inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients and equipment. we have in the past experienced disruptions within our supply chain resulting from, among other things, capacity, volume, systems, staffing, operational and covid-19-related challenges and may experience such supply chain disruptions again in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operational results. additionally, the effects of climate change could increase the frequency and duration of weather impacts on our operations and could adversely affect our operating results.
the food service market is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions. changes in these preferences and perceptions may reduce the demand for our products, which would reduce sales and harm our business.
food service businesses are affected by changes in consumer tastes, international, national, regional and local economic conditions, marketing, advertising, pricing and demographic trends. for instance, if prevailing health or dietary preferences cause consumers to avoid pizza and other products we offer in favor of foods that are perceived as healthier, or consumers shift away from delivery or carryout food, our business and operating results would be harmed. moreover, because we are primarily dependent on a single product, if consumer demand for pizza should decrease, our business would suffer more than if we had a more diversified menu, as many other food service businesses do, and the qsr pizza category may also not grow as quickly as other categories within the food service industry. the preferences of customers also may change as a result of advances in technology or alternative delivery methods or channels as well as geopolitical considerations. if we are not able to respond to these changes, or our competitors respond to these changes more effectively than us, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.
reports of product contamination, food-borne illness or food tampering or other events which may impact our reputation may reduce sales and harm our business.
reports, whether true or not, of product contamination, food-borne illnesses and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations of participants in the qsr market and could in the future as well. these events could occur both at the store and supply chain center levels. if such an event was to occur, we may not be able to respond to it quickly and effectively. the potential for acts of terrorism affecting our global food supply also exists and, if such an event occurs, could have a negative impact on us and could severely hurt sales and profits. in addition, our reputation is an important asset; as a result, anything that damages our reputation could immediately and severely affect our sales and profits. further, a boycott or other campaign critical of us, whether domestic or international, through social media or otherwise, could negatively impact our brand's reputation and, consequently, sales. media reports of product contamination, illnesses and injuries, whether accurate or not, could force some stores to close or otherwise reduce sales at such stores. moreover, as further described below, social media has dramatically increased the rate at which negative publicity, including as it relates to food-borne illness, can be disseminated before there is any meaningful opportunity to respond to or address an issue. even reports of food-borne illnesses or food tampering occurring solely at the restaurants of competitors could, by resulting in negative publicity about the restaurant industry in general, adversely affect us on a local, regional, national or international basis. our international operations expose us to further risk as our master franchisees are responsible for obtaining their own supply of food and equipment, subject to their compliance with our quality standards. a decrease in sales due to these health concerns, any negative publicity or as a result of the closure of any domino's stores could adversely affect our results of operations.
we do not have long-term contracts with certain of our suppliers, or have contracts which are set to expire, and as a result they could seek to significantly increase prices or fail to deliver.
we do not have long-term contracts or arrangements, or have contracts which are set to expire, with certain of our suppliers. although in the past we have not experienced significant problems with our suppliers, our suppliers may implement significant price increases or may not meet our requirements, including those that may result from increases in volume, in a timely fashion or at all. the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the ability of our supply chain centers to deliver necessary products to our stores and those of our franchisees and on our results of operations.
any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of our dough manufacturing and supply chain centers could harm our business.
in the u.s., we operate 22 regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers, two thin crust manufacturing facilities, one vegetable processing center and one center providing equipment and supplies to our u.s. and certain international stores. we also operate five dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in canada. we plan to continue investing in supply chain productivity initiatives in the future. our u.s. dough manufacturing and supply chain centers service all of our company-owned and substantially all of our u.s. franchise stores. any prolonged disruption in the operations of any of these facilities, whether due to technical, systems, operational or labor difficulties, destruction or damage to the facility, real estate issues, limited capacity or other reasons, or our failure to successfully increase capacity and open new centers, could adversely affect our business and operating results.
our inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could adversely impact our business.
the use of social media platforms and other consumer-oriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination and given users the ability to more effectively organize collective actions such as boycotts and other brand-damaging behaviors. negative publicity related to our brand, products, operations, or stores or related to our operations or actions by our executives, team members or franchisees and their team members or others perceived to be associated with our brand could harm our business, brand, reputation, marketing partners, financial condition and results of operations, regardless of the accuracy of such negative publicity. failure to use or respond to social media campaigns effectively could lead to a decline in brand value and revenue.
our success depends in part upon effective advertising, and lower advertising funds may reduce our ability to adequately market the domino's pizza brand.
we have been routinely named a leading national advertiser by advertising age and our success depends in part on continued effective advertising. each domino's store located in the u.s. is obligated to contribute 6.0% of its sales to dnaf, which uses such fees for national advertising in addition to contributions for local market-level advertising. we currently anticipate that this 6.0% obligation will remain in place for the foreseeable future, though the actual contribution rate could be lower in certain instances due to certain incentives and waivers. beginning on march 27, 2023, the company effectuated a temporary reduction of 0.25% to its standard 6.0% advertising contribution, which will expire on march 24, 2024. while additional funds for advertising in the past have been provided by us, our franchisees and other third parties, none of these additional funds are legally required. the lack of continued financial support for advertising activities could significantly curtail our marketing efforts, which may in turn affect our business and our operating results.
loss of key employees or our inability to attract and retain new qualified employees could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully.
our success in the highly competitive pizza delivery and carryout business will continue to depend to a significant extent on our leadership team and other key management personnel. although we have entered into employment agreements with russell j. weiner and joseph h. jordan, each of these executives may terminate his agreement on ninety days' notice and our other executive officers may do the same. as a result, we may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management.
while we do not have long-term employment agreements with our executive officers, for all of our executive officers we have non-compete and non-solicitation agreements that extend for 24 months following the termination of such executive officer's employment, although the ftc has proposed a new rule that would ban the use of non-compete agreements. our success will also continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate our stores, dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations. the loss of these employees or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel, including general managers or other store-level team members, or our inability to adequately respond to changes in the labor market, could adversely affect our operating results. changes we make to our current and future work environments may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees and may be perceived as less favorable compared to other companies' policies, which could negatively impact our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel.
our international operations subject us to additional risk. such risks and costs may differ in each country in which we and our franchisees do business and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs.
we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the u.s. our financial condition and results of operations have at times been and may in the future be adversely affected if global markets in which our franchised stores compete are affected by changes in political, economic or other factors. these factors, many over which neither we nor our master franchisees have control, may include both internal and external factors including:
•recessionary or expansive trends in international markets and global markets and economic downturns;
•changing labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign operations;
•increases in the taxes we pay and other changes in applicable tax laws both in the u.s. and globally;
•tariffs and trade barriers or foreign policy changes;
•legal and regulatory changes, and the burdens and costs of our compliance with a variety of foreign laws;
•changes in inflation rates or foreign exchange rates and the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds;
•ongoing and new relationships between our master franchisees and order and delivery aggregators our master franchisees may partner with internationally and the success of those aggregators and relationships;
•difficulty in collecting our royalties and longer payment cycles;
•expropriation of private enterprises;
•the inherent risk of doing business in china resulting from our equity investment in dpc dash;
•national and international conflicts, sanctions, acts of war or terrorist acts;
•increases in anti-american sentiment and the identification of domino's as an american brand, including those seen as a result of the geopolitical tensions in the middle east and further escalations and the impact thereof; and
•political and economic instability and uncertainty around the world and related geopolitical risk.
our earnings and business growth strategy depend on the success of our franchisees, and we may be harmed by actions taken by our franchisees, or employees of our franchisees, that are outside of our control.
a significant portion of our earnings comes from royalties and fees generated by our franchise stores. franchisees are independent operators, and their employees are not our employees. we provide tools that franchisees can consider using in training their employees, but the quality of franchise store operations and our brand and branded products may be diminished by numerous factors beyond our control. consequently, franchisees may not operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or they or their employees may take other actions that adversely affect the value of our brand and harm our business and reputation. our success also depends in part on continuing positive relationships with our franchisees (and positive relationships between our international master franchisees and their corresponding sub-franchisees) and if those relationships were to deteriorate, our revenues and stock price could decline. while we try to ensure that franchisees maintain the quality of the domino's brand and branded products and comply with their franchise agreements, franchisees may take actions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property or reputation or that are inconsistent with their contractual obligations. although our franchise arrangements permit the applicable franchisor to terminate a franchise agreement in certain circumstances, including the failure by franchisees to uphold product or operating standards, there is no assurance that such remedy will be available or sufficient to prevent harm to our brand and protect our intellectual property.
as of december 31, 2023, we had 735 independent u.s. franchisees operating 6,566 u.s. stores. as of that same date, 22 of these franchisees each owned and operated more than 50 u.s. stores, including our largest u.s. franchisee who owned and operated 143 stores and the average u.s. franchisee owned and operated approximately nine stores. our international master franchisees are generally responsible for the development of significantly more stores than our u.s. franchisees. as a result, our international operations are more closely tied to the success of a smaller number of franchisees than our u.s. operations. as of december 31, 2023, our largest international master franchisee operated 3,840 stores in 12 markets, which accounted for approximately 28% of our total international store count. our u.s. and international franchisees may not operate their franchises successfully. if one or more of our key franchisees were to be unsuccessful, become insolvent or otherwise were unable or unwilling to pay us our royalties or other amounts owed, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brand and branded products and adversely affect our business.
we depend in large part on our brand and branded products and believe that they are very important to our business. we rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, domain names, patents, trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products. the success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks in order to capitalize on our name recognition, increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both u.s. and international markets. we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark applications pending in the u.s. and foreign jurisdictions. not all of the trademarks or domain names that we currently use or contemplate using have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business, and they may never be registered in all of these countries. some countries' laws do not protect unregistered trademarks at all, or make them more difficult to enforce, and third parties may have filed for "domino's" or similar marks in countries where domino's has not registered its brand for reasons including lack of presence by the brand where actual use is required to obtain trademark registration. in addition, certain countries have use requirements to maintain a trademark registration. in those countries where we do not currently operate but have registered trademarks, we may be unable to renew those registrations when they expire due to non-use. accordingly, we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks everywhere in the world and our use of these trademarks may result in liability for trademark infringement, trademark dilution or unfair competition. all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property globally may not be adequate. in addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the u.s. we may, from time to time, be required to institute or defend litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, or to protect our trade secrets. such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our sales, profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights.
the occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in cybersecurity, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of confidential information, or damage to our employee and business relationships, any of which could subject us to loss and harm our brand.
a cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information resources. more specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information about customers, franchisees, suppliers or employees. many retailers and other companies have recently experienced serious cyber incidents and breaches of their information technology systems. as our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our systems, both internal and those we have outsourced, and we may further be negatively impacted to the extent outdated or legacy systems cease to function appropriately. we have in the past been and in the future may also be subject to negative impacts to our business caused by cyber incidents relating to our third-party service providers or the service providers of those third parties or our franchisees.
the primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption, damage to our relationships with customers, franchisees and employees, private data exposure, including payment card or other financial data, public relations impact and regulatory fines. in addition to maintaining insurance coverage to address cyber incidents, we have also implemented processes, procedures and controls to help mitigate these risks. the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by others, including by our service providers and these measures, as well as our increased awareness of the risk of a cyber incident, do not guarantee that our reputation and financial results will not be materially and adversely affected by such an incident. our business continuation or disaster recovery programs may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that could result from such disaster or disruption, and insurance and other safeguards may only partially reimburse us for our losses, if at all. artificial intelligence ("ai") technologies may intensify our cybersecurity risks.
we depend on the performance of suppliers, aggregators and other third parties in our business operations. third-party business processes we utilize include information technology, gift card authorization and processing, other payment processing, benefits, and other accounting and business services. the failure of our suppliers, aggregators and other third parties to maintain adequate controls or comply with our expectations and standards could have a material adverse effect on our business. our and our franchisees' operations depend upon our ability and the ability of franchisees, third-party service providers and the service providers of those third parties (as well as franchisees' third-party service providers and the service providers of those third parties) to protect computer equipment and systems against damage from theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure and other catastrophic or unanticipated events, as well as internal and external security incidents, viruses, denial-of-service attacks, phishing attacks, ransomware attacks and other intentional or unintentional disruptions. the rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies amplifies these concerns.
a significant portion of our retail sales depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems, including dom os, our online and mobile ordering platforms and our credit card processing systems. the failure of these systems to operate effectively, stemming from maintenance problems, upgrading or transitioning to new platforms, a compromise in our security or other unanticipated problems has at times in the past and in the future could result in interruptions to or delays in our and our franchisees' operations, and some of our systems are not fully redundant. the occurrence of a natural disaster, intentional sabotage or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in service. the recent increase in remote working could also exacerbate certain risks to our business, including an increased risk of cyber incidents and improper dissemination of personal or confidential information.
in addition, the implementation of technology changes and upgrades to maintain and upgrade our systems, errors or vulnerabilities in our systems, or damage to or failure of our systems, including because of systems becoming obsolete, could result in interruptions in our services and non-compliance with certain laws or regulations, which could reduce our sales, revenues and profits and damage our business and brand.
because we and our franchisees accept electronic forms of payment from customers including credit cards, our business requires the collection and retention of customer data, including sensitive financial data and other personally identifiable information in various information systems that are maintained by third parties with whom we and our franchisees contract to provide payment processing. a weakness in such third party's systems or software products (or in the systems or software products in the service providers of those third parties) may provide a mechanism for a cyber threat. in recent years, a significant number of companies have experienced data breaches in which customer information was stolen through vendor access channels. cyber-attacks and data breaches at a payment processing contractor could compromise confidential information or adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. there is also a potential heightened risk of cyber security incidents as a result of geopolitical events outside of our control, such as the ongoing russia-ukraine conflict. these problems could negatively affect our results of operations, and remediation could result in significant, unplanned capital investments.
we also maintain important internal company data, such as personally identifiable information about our employees and franchisees and information relating to our operations. in addition, more than 85% of our u.s. retail sales in 2023 were derived from digital channels, primarily through our online ordering website and mobile applications, where customers enter personally identifiable information that we retain. our use and retention of personally identifiable information is regulated by foreign, federal and state laws and regulations, as well as by certain third-party agreements. for example, the state of california has adopted the california privacy rights act of 2020, an amendment to the california consumer privacy act, and several other states have adopted similar comprehensive data protection laws, which may require companies to change their practices for handling of personal data, including allowing consumers to request that we delete certain personal data. in addition, the state of new york promulgated the new york shield act, like laws in several other states, which imposes obligations on businesses to implement physical, administrative and technical security measures to protect personal data. as privacy and information security laws and regulations change, we may incur additional costs to ensure that we remain in compliance with those laws and regulations, and our current and future planned uses of personal and other data may be adversely affected by future adopted privacy and information security laws, regulations and rulings. if our security and information systems are compromised or if we, our employees or franchisees fail to comply with these laws, regulations or contract terms, or to successfully implement processes related to requirements, laws and regulations governing cyber incidents, it could require us to notify customers, employees or other groups. this could result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and cash flows, increased fees payable to third parties and fines, penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect our reputation, business and results of operations. any other material disruption or other adverse event affecting one or more of our digital ordering platforms, including, for instance, power loss, technological or systems failures, user error or cyber-attacks, could similarly result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and cash flows and other costs, which could in turn materially and adversely affect our reputation, business and results of operations.
we cannot predict the impact that new or improved technologies, alternative methods of delivery, including autonomous vehicle delivery, or changes in consumer or employee behavior facilitated by these technologies and alternative methods of delivery will have on our business.
advances in technologies or alternative methods of delivery, including advances in digital ordering technology and autonomous vehicle delivery, or certain changes in consumer behavior driven by these or other technologies and methods of delivery could have a negative effect on our business and market position. moreover, technology and consumer offerings continue to develop, and we expect that new or enhanced technologies and consumer offerings will be available in the future. we may pursue certain of those technologies and consumer offerings if we believe they offer a sustainable customer proposition and can be successfully integrated into our business model. however, we cannot predict consumer acceptance of these delivery channels or their impact on our business. we may incorporate traditional and generative ai solutions into our business, and these solutions may become important in our operations over time. the use of these ai solutions may expose us to additional risks and expenses. in addition, our competitors, some of whom have greater resources than we do, may be able to benefit more from changes in technologies or consumer acceptance of alternative methods of delivery.
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully respond to changing consumer preferences, including with respect to new technologies and alternative methods of delivery, or to effectively adjust our product mix, service offerings, and marketing and merchandising initiatives for products and services that address, and anticipate advances in, technology and market trends. alternative methods of delivery may also impact the potential labor pool from which we recruit our delivery experts and could reduce the available supply of labor. if we are not able to successfully respond to these challenges, our business could be materially and adversely affected.
we are subject to a variety of additional risks associated with our franchisees.
our franchise system subjects us to a number of additional risks, any one of which may impact our ability to collect royalty payments and fees from our franchisees, may harm the goodwill associated with our brand, and/or may materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations. such risks may also apply to us as owners of stores. these risks include, but are not limited to:
•those relating to the application of local, state, federal and foreign bankruptcy laws and other applicable laws governing creditors' rights generally and the impact such laws could have on our ability to collect payments and fees under applicable franchise agreements;
•those relating to franchisees that are operating entities, which generally are not limited-purpose entities, including business, credit, financial and other risks in addition to risks related to unions;

our current insurance coverage may not be adequate, insurance premiums for such coverage may increase and we may not be able to obtain insurance at acceptable rates, or at all.
for certain periods prior to december 1998 and for periods after december 2001, we maintain insurance coverage for workers' compensation, general liability and owned and non-owned automobile liabilities. we are generally responsible for up to $2.0 million per occurrence under these retention programs for workers' compensation and general liability, depending on policy year and line of coverage. we are generally responsible for up to between $500,000 and $5.5 million per occurrence under these retention programs for owned and non-owned automobile liabilities, depending on policy year and line of coverage. total insurance limits under these retention programs vary depending upon the period covered and range up to $110.0 million per occurrence for general liability and owned and non-owned automobile liabilities and up to the applicable statutory limits for workers' compensation. these insurance policies may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities that we incur in our business. in addition, in the future our insurance premiums may increase, and we may not be able to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms, or at all. any such inadequacy of, or inability to obtain insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
environmental, social and governance matters may impact our business and reputation.
increasingly, in addition to the importance of their financial performance, companies are being judged by their performance on a variety of environmental, social and governance ("esg") matters, which are considered to contribute to the long-term sustainability of companies' performance. major institutional investors have publicly emphasized the importance of such esg matters to their investment decisions. further, we set and submitted our science based targets for validation in 2023 and have established a commitment to achieve those science based targets by 2032 and achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. execution of these strategies and achievement of these goals are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control and may prove to be more costly than we anticipate. these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, our ability to execute our strategies and achieve our goals within the currently projected costs and the expected timeframes; unforeseen design, operational and technological difficulties; the outcome of research efforts and future technology developments; the success of our collaboration with franchisees and other third parties; and the actions of competitors and competitive pressures. there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute our strategies and achieve our goals. failure to achieve our goals could damage our reputation and customer, investor and other stakeholder relationships and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as on our stock price. there also has been increased political focus, including by u.s. and foreign governmental authorities, on environmental sustainability matters, such as climate change, the reduction of greenhouse gases and water usage; there has also been pushback to certain esg initiatives in recent years which could also have an adverse effect. the sec has included in its regulatory agenda proposed rulemaking on climate change disclosures that, if adopted, could significantly increase compliance burdens and associated regulatory costs and the complexity of the regulatory framework. legislative, regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other esg concerns could also result in new or more stringent forms of oversight and expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence and disclosure, which could increase costs, bring additional focus and further impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. any failure or perceived failure by us to manage esg issues successfully could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and on our business, results of operations, financial condition or stock price, including the sustainability of our business over time.
risks related to our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business.
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness. as of december 31, 2023, our consolidated total indebtedness was approximately $4.99 billion. we may also incur additional debt, which would not be prohibited under the terms of our current securitized debt agreements. our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for our business and our shareholders. for example, it could:
•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt agreements;
•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes; and
•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our peers that may have less debt.
further, our 2021 variable funding notes and 2022 variable funding notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates that in certain circumstances is based on a forward-looking term rate based on the secured overnight financing rate ("term sofr"). term sofr is a relatively new index that is administered by the federal reserve bank of new york (the "new york fed"). there can be no assurance that the new york fed will not discontinue the publication of term sofr, in which case interest payments on our 2021 variable funding notes and 2022 variable funding notes would need to be calculated using a different index, or alter the manner in which term sofr is calculated. as a result, our interest expense could increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected.
our interest expense could also be increased by rising interest rates. in addition, the financial and other covenants we agreed to with our lenders may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, pay dividends and engage in other transactions, and the leverage may cause potential lenders to be less willing to loan funds to us in the future. our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of repayment of all of our indebtedness.
downgrades in our credit ratings could impact our ability to access capital and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our debt is rated by credit rating agencies. these agencies may downgrade their credit ratings for us based on the performance of our business, our capital strategies or their overall view of our industry. there can be no assurance that any rating assigned to our currently outstanding indebtedness will remain in effect for any given period of time or that any such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that agency's judgment, circumstances so warrant. a downgrade of our credit ratings could, among other things, increase our cost of borrowing, limit our ability to access capital or result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur, and thereby could adversely impact our business and operations.
we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
our ability to make principal and interest payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. this, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, in the amounts projected or at all, or if future borrowings are not available to us under our variable funding notes in amounts sufficient to fund our other liquidity needs, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled principal amortization and interest payments on our debt obligations in the future, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, sell assets, delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity. if we are unable to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all or to affect any other action relating to our indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all, our business may be harmed.
the terms of our securitized debt financing of certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries have restrictive terms and our failure to comply with any of these terms could put us in default, which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects.
unless and until we repay all outstanding borrowings under our securitized debt, we will remain subject to the restrictive terms of these borrowings. the securitized debt, under which certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries issued and guaranteed fixed rate notes and variable funding senior revolving notes, contain a number of covenants, with the most significant financial covenant being a debt service coverage calculation. these covenants limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things:
•sell assets;
•alter the business we conduct and engage in mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations;
•declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock;
•incur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness or guarantees and make loans and investments;
•incur liens; and
•enter into transactions with affiliates.
the securitized debt also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios at the end of each fiscal quarter. these restrictions could affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock. our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not satisfy such a test. a breach of these covenants could result in a rapid amortization event or default under the securitized debt. if amounts owed under the securitized debt are accelerated because of a default under the securitized debt and we are unable to pay such amounts, the investors may have the right to assume control of substantially all of the securitized assets.
during the term following issuance, the outstanding senior notes will accrue interest in accordance with the terms of the debt agreements. additionally, our senior notes have original scheduled principal payments of $51.5 million in 2024, $1.17 billion in 2025, $39.3 million in 2026, $1.31 billion in 2027, $811.5 million in 2028, $625.9 million in 2029, $10.0 million in 2030 and $905.0 million in 2031.
in accordance with our debt agreements, the payment of principal on the outstanding senior notes may be suspended if the leverage ratio for the company is less than or equal to 5.0x total debt, as defined, to adjusted ebitda, as defined in the indenture governing our securitized debt, and no catch-up provisions are applicable.
if we are unable to refinance or repay amounts under the securitized debt prior to the expiration of the term, our cash flow would be directed to the repayment of the securitized debt and, other than a weekly management fee sufficient to cover minimal selling, general and administrative expenses, would not be available for operating our business. no assurance can be given that any refinancing or additional financing will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms. in addition, our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and capital markets and other factors beyond our control. there can be no assurance that market conditions will be favorable at the times that we require new or additional financing. the indenture governing the securitized debt will restrict the cash flow from the entities subject to the securitization to any of our other entities and upon the occurrence of certain events, cash flow would be further restricted. in the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the indenture (including, without limitation, upon an event of default under the indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of its term), the funds available to us would be reduced or eliminated, which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business.
regulatory, legal and compliance risks we face risks of litigation, investigations, enforcement actions and negative publicity from customers, franchisees, suppliers, employees, regulators and others in the ordinary course of business, which could divert our financial and management resources. litigation, investigations, enforcement actions or publicity may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
claims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry, and vehicular accidents and injuries occur in the food delivery business. we are currently subject to these types of claims and have been subject to these types of claims in the past. claims within our industry of improper supplier actions also occasionally arise that, if made against one of our suppliers, could potentially damage our brand image.
in addition, class action lawsuits have been filed, and may continue to be filed, against various qsrs alleging, among other things, that qsrs have failed to disclose the health risks associated with high-fat foods and that qsr marketing practices have encouraged obesity. state attorney general offices or other regulators have initiated and may in the future initiate investigations or enforcement actions against us. in addition to decreasing our sales and profitability and diverting our management resources, adverse publicity resulting from such allegations may materially and adversely affect us and our brand, regardless of whether such allegations are valid or whether we are liable, and could result in a substantial settlement, fine, penalty or judgment against us. further, we may be subject to employee, franchisee and other claims in the future based on, among other things, discrimination, harassment, working and safety conditions, wrongful termination and wage, expense reimbursement, rest break and meal break issues, including claims relating to minimum wage and overtime compensation. we and our international master franchisees have been and continue to be subject to these types of claims. if one or more of these claims were to be successful or if there is a significant increase in the number of these claims or if we receive significant negative publicity, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed. we and our franchisees are subject to extensive laws and government regulation and requirements issued by other groups and our failure to comply with existing or increased laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and operating results.
we are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, as well as requirements issued by other groups, including those relating to:
•the preparation, sale and labeling of food;
•building and zoning requirements and environmental protection;
•labor and employment, including minimum wage, overtime, insurance, discrimination and other labor requirements as well as working and safety conditions;
•franchise arrangements;
•taxation;
•antitrust;
•payment card industry standards and requirements; and
•advertising, social media, information privacy and consumer protection.
we are subject to an ftc rule and to various state and foreign laws that govern the offer and sale of franchises. these laws regulate various aspects of the franchise relationship, including terminations and the refusal to renew franchises. the failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales, fines or other penalties or require us to make offers of rescission or restitution, any of which could adversely affect our business.
we and our franchisees face various regulatory and legislative efforts to enforce employment laws, such as efforts to categorize franchisors as the co-employers or joint employers of their franchisees' employees or to aggregate individual franchised businesses and classify them as large employers for minimum wage or other employment-related purposes. in october 2023, the national labor relations board ("nlrb") adopted a final rule with a new and broader standard grounded in common law agency principles for determining when two or more otherwise unrelated employers may be found to be a joint employer of the same employees under the national labor relations act (the "nlra"). the nlrb's final rule is scheduled to go into effect on february 26, 2024; if it is adopted by other government agencies and/or applied generally to franchise relationships, it could cause us to be liable or held responsible for unfair labor practices and other violations of our franchisees and subject us to other liabilities, and require us to conduct collective bargaining negotiations regarding employees of totally separate, independent employers, most notably our franchisees. in such event, our operating expenses may increase as a result of required modifications to our business practices, increased litigation, governmental investigations or proceedings, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil liability.
additionally, based upon the outcome and application of recent legal proceedings in federal court in california involving the california wage and hour laws in another franchise system, franchisors may be subject to claims that their franchisees should be treated as employees and not as independent contractors under the wage and hour laws of that state and, potentially, certain other states and localities with similar wage and hour laws. the california legislature has enacted a statute known as assembly bill 5 (ab-5), which went into effect on january 1, 2020. ab-5 requires "gig economy" workers to be reclassified as employees instead of independent contractors. however, depending upon the application of ab-5, franchisors in certain industries could be deemed to be covered by the statute, in which event certain franchisees could be deemed employees of the franchisors. while active efforts to narrow the reach of ab-5 continue, a bill (sb 967), which was introduced specifically to exempt the relationship between a franchisor and franchisee from the scope of ab-5, was not successful in the legislature.
on november 3, 2020, the california electorate approved proposition 22, the effect of which is to exempt app-based transportation (ride shares) and delivery drivers from the application of ab-5 by treating these workers as independent contractors, rather than employees, provided certain conditions are met. the ballot measure does not affect how ab-5 applies to other businesses and workers. given that misclassification claims have been successful against or applied to a franchisor under ab-5 and may be successful under similar state laws, a franchisor could be liable to its franchisees (and potentially their employees) based the rights and remedies available to employees under such laws and, thereafter, have to treat its franchisees (and their employees) as the franchisor's employees under these laws.
we and our franchisees are subject to the fair labor standards act of 1938, as amended (the "flsa"), which, along with the family and medical leave act, governs such matters as minimum wage and overtime requirements and other working conditions and various family leave mandates, as well as a variety of other laws enacted, or rules and regulations promulgated, by federal, state and local governmental authorities that govern these and other employment matters. we and our franchisees have experienced and expect further increases in payroll expenses as a result of government-mandated increases in the minimum wage, some specific to employees of national fast food chains, which may be material, including as a result of california's ab 1228. enactment and enforcement of various federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations on immigration and labor organizations may adversely impact the availability and costs of labor for domino's and franchisees' stores in a particular area or across the united states. in addition, third-party suppliers may be affected by higher minimum wage standards, which may increase the price of goods and services they supply to us. such increased expenses may cause our franchisees to exit the business or cause us to reduce the number of company-owned stores, or otherwise adversely affect the amount of royalty payments and license fees we receive. on january 12, 2020, the u.s. department of labor announced a final rule to update and clarify the definition of joint employer under the flsa. under the final rule, the general test for assessing whether a party can be deemed a joint employer would be based upon whether that party (i) hires or fires the employee; (ii) supervises and controls the employee's work schedule or conditions of employment; (iii) determines the employee's rate and method of payment; and (iv) maintains the employee's employment records. in the final rule, the department of labor describes instances in which joint employment would not be more or less likely to be found to exist under the flsa, which, according to the department of labor, includes the relationships that exist under the typical franchise business model. this rule may reduce a franchisor's risk of liability that currently exists under the joint employer standard now in effect under the flsa (though ultimately, the facts specific to the franchisor-franchisee model at issue would be considered when determining liability). on july 29, 2021, the current administration's department of labor issued a final rule rescinding the 2020 rule. the department of labor may revert to the more expansive interpretation of joint employer that existed prior to the adoption of the 2020 rule and/or interpretations that could result in franchisors being held liable or responsible for flsa violations by their franchisees. the rules of the department of labor are separate from the joint employer standard under the nlra or, as described above, potential liability as a joint employer under the nlra.
in october 2023, the ftc proposed a rule targeting misleading and hidden fees and how businesses may advertise and market prices to consumers; a law addressing hidden fees will take effect in california starting july 1, 2024 after senate bill no. 478 was signed into law. the ultimate scope of these rules and laws is currently unknown, but could be determined to apply to restaurants and fees such as delivery fees, service charges or surcharges that could impact the way we advertise to consumers. to the extent our advertising is negatively impacted, our business could be adversely affected.
certain governmental authorities and private litigants have recently asserted claims against franchisors, including us, for provisions in our prior franchise agreements that restrict franchisees from soliciting or hiring the employees of other franchisees or the applicable franchisor. claims against franchisors for such clauses include allegations that these clauses violate state and federal antitrust and unfair practices laws by restricting the free movement of employees of franchisees and/or franchisor (including the employees of company-owned stores), thereby depressing the wages of those employees.
the patient protection and affordable care act (as amended, the "affordable care act") requires employers such as us to provide health insurance for all qualifying employees or pay penalties for not providing coverage. the majority of the increases in these costs began in 2015, and while the incremental costs of this program have not been material to us to date, we cannot predict what effect these costs will have on our results of operations and financial position, or the effects of the affordable care act on some of our larger franchisees. modifications to, or repeal of, all or certain provisions of the affordable care act are also possible. changes in tax laws or tax policy more broadly, increases in the enacted tax rates, adverse outcomes in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could also impact our financial condition and results of operations.
we may also become subject to legislation or regulation seeking to tax and/or regulate high-fat foods, foods with high sugar and salt content, or foods otherwise deemed to be "unhealthy," and our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation and compliance measures related to these laws or regulations.
adverse government regulations and enforcement efforts or non-compliance by us or our franchisees with any of the foregoing laws and regulations could lead to various claims or governmental or judicial fines, sanctions or other enforcement measures, which could negatively impact our business.
market and general risks fluctuations in value of the u.s. dollar in relation to other currencies may lead to lower revenues and earnings.
exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and we have in the past experienced significant adverse changes in foreign currency rates. international franchise royalties and fees represented approximately 6.9%, 6.5% and 6.8% of our total revenues in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies. we also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in canada, which generate revenues denominated in canadian dollars. sales made by franchised stores outside the u.s. are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located, and this currency could become less valuable in u.s. dollars as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. unfavorable currency fluctuations could lead to increased prices to customers outside the u.s. or lower profitability to our franchisees outside the u.s., or could result in lower revenues for us, on a u.s. dollar basis, from such customers and franchisees. a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency rates in our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on international royalty revenues of approximately $27.4 million in 2023.
our annual and quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control, and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price may decline significantly or be subject to significant fluctuations.
our annual and quarterly financial results, including our sales and operating results, can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. these factors include, among other things:
•variations in the timing and volume of our sales and our franchisees' sales, including same store sales;
•the timing of expenditures in anticipation of future sales;
•changes in the cost or availability of our ingredients or labor;
•planned or actual changes to our capital or debt structure;
•strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as sales promotions, acquisitions or restructurings;
•changes in our dividend policy or any share repurchase program;
•significant litigation or legislation or other regulatory developments affecting us or our industry;
•changes in competitive and economic conditions generally as well as general market conditions; and
•foreign currency exposure.
as a result, our operational performance may decline quickly and significantly in response to changes in order patterns or rapid decreases in demand for our products. any such decline may cause us and our franchisees to experience lower sales revenue. we anticipate that fluctuations in operating results will continue in the future, and such fluctuations may result in significant fluctuations or a significant decline in our stock price.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
overview our fiscal year typically includes 52 weeks, comprised of three twelve-week quarters and one sixteen-week quarter.
in this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended january 1, 2023. for a discussion of the fiscal year ended january 1, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended january 2, 2022, please refer to part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended january 1, 2023.
description of the business domino's is the largest pizza company in the world with more than 20,500 locations in over 90 markets around the world as of december 31, 2023, and operates two distinct service models within its stores, with a significant business in both delivery and carryout. we are a highly recognized global brand, and we focus on value while serving neighborhoods locally through our large worldwide network of franchise owners and u.s. company-owned stores through both the delivery and carryout service models. we have been selling quality, affordable food to our customers since 1960. we became "domino's pizza" in 1965 and opened our first franchised store in 1967. over more than 60 years, we have built domino's into one of the most widely-recognized consumer brands in the world. we believe our commitment to value, convenience, quality and new products continues to keep consumers engaged with the brand.
we are primarily a franchisor, with approximately 99% of domino's global stores owned and operated by our independent franchisees as of december 31, 2023. franchising enables an individual to be a business owner and maintain control over all employment-related matters and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the strength of the domino's global brand and operating system with limited capital investment by us.
domino's business model is straightforward: domino's stores handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price, with easy ordering access and efficient service, enhanced by our technological innovations. our hand-tossed dough is made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees.
domino's generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our franchisees. royalties are ongoing percent-of-sales fees for use of the domino's® brand marks. we also generate revenues and earnings by selling food, equipment and supplies to franchisees through our supply chain operations primarily in the u.s. and canada and by operating a number of company-owned stores in the united states. franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers. in our international markets, we generally grant geographical rights to the domino's pizza® brand to master franchisees. these master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area, and they may profit by sub-franchising and selling food and equipment to those sub-franchisees, as well as by running pizza stores. we believe that everyone in the system can benefit from the franchise model, including the end consumer, who can purchase domino's menu items for themselves and their family conveniently and economically.
domino's business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and our company-owned stores. it can also yield significant cash flows to us, through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream, with moderate capital expenditures. we have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. at domino's, we believe we have a proven business model for success that has historically driven strong returns for our shareholders.
domino's financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our franchised and company-owned stores. changes in retail sales are primarily driven by same store sales growth and net store growth. we monitor both of these metrics very closely, as they directly impact our revenues and profits, and we strive to consistently increase both metrics. retail sales drive royalty payments from franchisees, as well as company-owned store and supply chain revenues.
critical accounting estimates the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, our management evaluates its estimates, including those related to long-lived assets, casualty insurance reserves and income taxes. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from those estimates, and changes in estimates could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period.
we believe that our most critical accounting estimates are:
long-lived assets we record long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and capitalized software, at cost. for acquisitions of franchise operations, we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets, historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition. we depreciate and amortize long-lived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us. we evaluate the potential impairment of long-lived assets at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. our periodic evaluation is based on various analyses, including, on an annual basis, the projection of undiscounted cash flows. if we determine that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable, we compare the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group. for company-owned stores, we perform related impairment tests on an operating market basis, which we have determined to be the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other cash flows. if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds the amount of the expected future undiscounted cash flows of that asset, we estimate the fair value of the asset. if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized, and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to project the future market cash flows of company-owned stores during the years presented. same store sales fluctuations and the rates at which operating costs will fluctuate in the future are key factors in determining projected cash flows used to evaluate recoverability of the related assets. if our same store sales significantly decline or if operating costs increase and we are unable to recover these costs, the carrying value of our company-owned stores, by market, may not be recoverable and we may be required to recognize an impairment charge. there were no triggering events in 2023, 2022 or 2021, and accordingly, we did not record any impairment losses on long-lived assets in 2023, 2022 and 2021.
casualty insurance reserves for certain periods prior to december 1998 and for periods after december 2001, we maintain insurance coverage for workers' compensation, general liability and owned and non-owned automobile liabilities. we are generally responsible for up to $2.0 million per occurrence under these retention programs for workers' compensation and general liability, depending on policy year and line of coverage. we are generally responsible for up to between $500,000 and $5.5 million per occurrence under these retention programs for owned and non-owned automobile liabilities, depending on policy year and line of coverage. the related insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates, which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events. there is inherent uncertainty in the ultimate cost for known claims under our insurance coverages, and for incidents that have occurred that will be subject to a claim, but have yet to be reported to us. analyses of historical trends and actuarial valuation methods are utilized to estimate the ultimate claim costs for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date and for claims incurred but not yet reported. when estimating these liabilities, several factors are considered, including the severity, duration and frequency of claims, legal cost associated with claims, healthcare trends and projected inflation.
our methodology for determining our exposure has remained consistent throughout the years presented. management believes that the various assumptions developed, and actuarial methods used to determine our casualty insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks. changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions, as well as changes in actual experience, could cause our estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods. a 10% change in our casualty insurance liability at december 31, 2023 would have affected our income before provision for income taxes by approximately $5.6 million in 2023. we had accruals for casualty insurance reserves of $56.3 million and $57.6 million at december 31, 2023 and january 1, 2023, respectively.
income taxes the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate was 21% in each of 2023, 2022 and 2021. our federal income tax provision calculated based on the federal statutory rate was $137.0 million, $120.3 million and $131.4 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. we measure deferred taxes using current enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid. judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, related reserves and deferred taxes. these include establishing a valuation allowance related to the ability to realize certain deferred tax assets, if necessary. on an ongoing basis, management will assess whether it remains more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. our accounting for deferred taxes represents our best estimate of future events. except with respect to certain foreign tax credits and interest deductibility in separately filed states, our deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions, based on our estimates and assumptions. as of december 31, 2023 and january 1, 2023, we had total foreign tax credits of $16.8 million and $13.5 million, respectively, each of which were fully offset with a corresponding valuation allowance. we also had valuation allowances related to interest deductibility in separately filed states of $1.4 million and $1.5 million as of december 31, 2023 and january 1, 2023, respectively. we believe our remaining deferred tax assets will be realized. changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

russia market on august 21, 2023, our master franchisee that owned and operated domino's pizza® stores in russia announced its intent to file for bankruptcy with respect to the stores in that market. therefore, as of august 21, 2023, we have considered the stores in the russia market to be closed and they are excluded from our ending store count as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. we have presented our statistical measure of global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, for fiscal 2023 excluding the impact of the retail sales from the russia market. the 2023 global retail sales growth measures excluding the russia market are calculated as the growth in retail sales excluding the retail sales from the russia market from both 2023 retail sales and the 2022 retail sales base. we believe the impact of the russia market on our statistical measure of global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, for the fiscal years 2022 and 2021 were immaterial and prior amounts have not been adjusted to conform to the current year presentation. we believe the impact of the russia market on our statistical measure of same store sales growth for the periods presented was immaterial, and we also believe the impact of the russia market on our consolidated statements of income related to international franchise royalties and fee revenues and general and administrative expenses for the periods presented was immaterial. we have not received any royalties and fees from the operations of the russia market subsequent to the russian invasion of ukraine in february 2022.

revenues primarily consist of retail sales from our company-owned stores, royalties and fees and advertising contributions from our u.s. franchised stores, royalties and fees from our international franchised stores and sales of food, equipment and supplies from our supply chain centers to substantially all of our u.s. franchised stores and certain international franchised stores. company-owned store and franchised store revenues may vary from period to period due to changes in store count mix. supply chain revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of fluctuations in food and commodity prices as well as the mix of products we sell.
consolidated revenues decreased $57.8 million, or 1.3%, in 2023 due primarily to lower u.s. company-owned store revenues as a result of the refranchising of 114 u.s. company-owned stores in the fourth quarter of 2022 ("the 2022 store sale") as well as lower supply chain revenues primarily due to a shift in the relative mix of the products we sell. additionally, u.s. franchise advertising revenues decreased as a result of a temporary reduction of 0.25% to the standard 6.0% advertising contribution which was effectuated on march 27, 2023, as well as an increase in advertising incentives related to certain brand promotions. these decreases were partially offset by higher u.s. franchise royalties and fees revenues primarily due to an increase in fees paid by our franchisees for the use of our technology platforms, an increase in the average number of u.s. franchised stores open during the period resulting from net store growth and the 2022 store sale as well as higher same store sales. international franchise royalties and fees revenues also increased as a result of net store growth and higher same store sales. these changes in revenues are described in more detail below.

u.s. company-owned stores revenues from u.s. company-owned store operations decreased $69.6 million, or 15.6%, in 2023 primarily due to a decrease in the average number of u.s. company-owned stores open during the period resulting from the 2022 store sale, but this decrease was partially offset by higher same store sales. u.s. company-owned same store sales increased 5.4% in 2023 and declined 2.6% in 2022.
u.s. franchise royalties and fees revenues from u.s. franchise royalties and fees increased $48.6 million, or 8.7%, in 2023 primarily due to an increase in fees paid by our franchisees for the use of our technology platforms, an increase in the average number of u.s. franchised stores open during the period resulting from net store growth and the 2022 store sale as well as higher same store sales. u.s. franchise same store sales increased 1.4% in 2023 and declined 0.7% in 2022.
u.s. franchise advertising revenues from u.s. franchise advertising decreased $12.1 million, or 2.5%, in 2023 primarily due to a temporary reduction of 0.25% to the standard 6.0% advertising contribution effectuated on march 27, 2023 as well as an increase in advertising incentives related to certain brand promotions. the company recorded approximately $14.5 million more in advertising incentives related to certain brand promotions in 2023 as compared to 2022. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the average number of u.s. franchised stores open during the period as a result of net store growth and the 2022 store sale as well as higher same store sales.
supply chain supply chain revenues decreased $39.7 million, or 1.4%, in 2023 due primarily to a shift in the relative mix of the products we sell. our market basket pricing to stores decreased 0.5% during 2023 which did not have a significant impact on supply chain revenues. the market basket pricing change, a statistical measure utilized by management, is calculated as the percentage change of the market basket purchased by an average u.s. store (based on average weekly unit sales) from our u.s. supply chain centers against the comparable period of the prior year. we believe this measure is important to understanding company performance because as our market basket prices fluctuate, our revenues, cost of sales and gross margin percentages in our supply chain segment also fluctuate.
international franchise royalties and fee revenues revenues from international franchise royalties and fees increased $15.1 million, or 5.1%, in 2023 due primarily to an increase in the average number of international franchised stores open during the period, resulting from net store growth and same store sales growth (excluding foreign currency impact). the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $5.8 million in 2023 partially offset the increases in international franchise royalties and fees. the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on international franchise royalty revenues, a statistical measure utilized by management, is calculated as the difference in international franchise royalty revenues resulting from translating current year local currency results to u.s. dollars at current year exchange rates as compared to prior year exchange rates. we believe this measure is important to understanding company performance given the significant variability in international franchise royalty revenues that can be driven by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, international same store sales increased 1.7% in 2023 and increased 0.1% in 2022.

consolidated cost of sales consists of u.s. company-owned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues. components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food, labor, delivery and occupancy costs. consolidated gross margin (which we define as revenues less cost of sales) increased $78.8 million, or 4.8%, in 2023 due primarily to higher global franchise royalty and fee revenues, as well as improved procurement productivity within supply chain. franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on gross margin. additionally, as our market basket prices fluctuate, our revenues and gross margin percentages in our supply chain segment also fluctuate; however, actual product-level dollar margins remain unchanged.
as a percentage of revenues, the consolidated gross margin increased 2.3 percentage points to 38.6% in 2023 from 36.3% in 2022. company-owned store gross margin increased 1.2 percentage points in 2023 and supply chain gross margin increased 1.3 percentage points in 2023. these changes in gross margin are described in more detail below.

u.s. company-owned store gross margin (which does not include certain store-level costs such as royalties and advertising) decreased $6.3 million, or 9.3%, in 2023 due primarily to the 2022 store sale. as a percentage of store revenues, the u.s. company-owned store gross margin increased 1.2 percentage points in 2023. these changes in store gross margin as a percentage of revenues are discussed in additional detail below.
•food costs decreased 2.3 percentage points to 29.1% in 2023 driven primarily by the decrease in the market basket pricing to stores as well as improved sales leverage resulting from increases in menu and national offer pricing.
•labor costs increased 1.1 percentage points to 31.6% in 2023 due primarily to higher wage rates in our u.s. company-owned stores in 2023.

supply chain gross margin increased $33.5 million, or 13.7%, in 2023. as a percentage of supply chain revenues, the supply chain gross margin increased 1.3 percentage points in 2023, primarily due to lower food cost as a result of procurement productivity. this improvement in supply chain gross margin as a percentage of supply chain revenues was partially offset by higher labor costs as a percentage of supply chain revenues.
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased $18.0 million, or 4.3%, in 2023 primarily due to higher labor costs.
u.s. franchise advertising expenses u.s. franchise advertising expenses decreased $12.1 million, or 2.5%, in 2023, consistent with the decrease in u.s. franchise advertising revenues as discussed above. u.s. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related u.s. franchise advertising revenues are recognized, as our consolidated not-for-profit advertising fund is obligated to expend such revenues on advertising and other activities that promote the domino's brand, and these revenues cannot be used for general corporate purposes.
refranchising loss/gain during 2023, we refranchised one u.s. company-owned store for proceeds of less than $0.1 million. the pre-tax refranchising loss associated with the sale of the related assets and liabilities, including goodwill, was approximately $0.1 million and was recorded in refranchising loss in our consolidated statements of income.
during 2022, we completed the 2022 store sale in which we refranchised 114 u.s. company-owned stores in arizona and utah for proceeds of $41.1 million. in connection with the 2022 store sale, we recorded a $21.2 million pre-tax refranchising gain on the sale of the related assets and liabilities, including a $4.3 million reduction in goodwill.
other income other income was $17.7 million in 2023, representing the unrealized gains recorded on our investment in dpc dash based on the active exchange quoted price for the equity security. we did not record any adjustments to the carrying amount in fiscal 2022. additional information related to our investment in dpc dash is included in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.
interest expense, net interest expense, net, decreased $10.3 million, or 5.3%, in 2023 driven by higher interest income earned on our cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents in 2023. our weighted average borrowing rate was 3.8% in both 2023 and 2022.
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes increased $12.8 million, or 10.6%, in 2023 due to an increase in income before the provision for income taxes, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. the effective tax rate decreased to 20.4% during 2023, as compared to 21.0% in 2022. the lower effective tax rate in 2023 was driven primarily by higher foreign tax credits. this decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the release of certain unrecognized tax benefits related to one of our foreign subsidiaries during 2022 that did not recur in 2023 and a higher proportion of non-deductible expenses associated with covered officer compensation in 2023 as compared to 2022.
segment income we evaluate the performance of our reportable segments and allocate resources to them based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other, referred to as segment income. segment income for each of our reportable segments is summarized in the table below. other segment income primarily includes corporate administrative costs that are not allocable to a reportable segment, including labor, computer expenses, professional fees, travel and entertainment, rent, insurance and other corporate administrative costs.
in the first quarter of 2023, we changed our allocation methodology for certain costs which support certain internally developed software used across our franchise system. the change in allocation methodology of certain software development costs resulted in an estimated increase in u.s. stores segment income of $65.7 million, an estimated increase in international franchise segment income of $8.9 million and an estimated decrease in other segment income of $74.6 million in 2023. the change in allocation methodology of certain software development costs had no impact on revenues, supply chain segment income or total segment income.

u.s. stores u.s. stores segment income increased $82.4 million, or 18.8%, in 2023, primarily due to the change in allocation methodology for certain software development costs, as well as higher u.s. franchise royalties and fees revenues, each as discussed above. these increases were partially offset by the $6.3 million decrease in u.s. company-owned store gross margin, as discussed above. u.s. franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on u.s. stores segment income. u.s. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related u.s. franchise advertising revenues are recognized and had no impact on u.s. stores segment income.
supply chain supply chain segment income increased $36.6 million, or 17.5%, in 2023 due primarily to the $33.5 million increase in supply chain gross margin described above.
international franchise international franchise segment income increased $23.5 million, or 9.9%, in 2023, primarily due to higher international franchise royalties and fees revenues as well as the change in allocation methodology for certain software development costs, each as discussed above. international franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on international franchise segment income.
other other segment income decreased $60.9 million, or 233.9%, in 2023 due primarily to the change in allocation methodology for certain software development costs as discussed above, as well as higher labor costs.
new accounting pronouncements the impact of new accounting pronouncements adopted and the estimated impact of new accounting pronouncements that we will adopt in future years is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
liquidity and capital resources historically, our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities resulting in efficient deployment of working capital. we generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience multiple inventory turns per month. in addition, our sales are not typically seasonal, which further limits variations in our working capital requirements. as of december 31, 2023, we had working capital of $67.0 million, excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of $200.9 million, advertising fund assets, restricted of $106.3 million and advertising fund liabilities of $104.2 million. working capital includes total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $114.1 million.
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our variable funding notes. during 2023, we experienced global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, in both our u.s. and international businesses. these factors contributed to our continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows. in addition to our cash flows from operations, we have two variable funding note facilities. the facilities include our 2022 variable funding notes (defined below), which allows for advances of up to $120.0 million, as well as our 2021 variable funding notes (defined below), which allows for advances of up to $200.0 million and certain other credit instruments, including letters of credit (the 2021 variable funding notes and the 2022 variable funding notes, the "2022 and 2021 variable funding notes"). the letters of credit primarily relate to our casualty insurance programs and certain supply chain center leases. as of december 31, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings and $120.0 million of available borrowing capacity under our 2022 variable funding notes. as of december 31, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings and $157.8 million of available borrowing capacity under our 2021 variable funding notes, net of letters of credit issued of $42.2 million.
we expect to continue to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, any excess cash from our recapitalization transactions and available borrowings under our 2022 and 2021 variable funding notes to, among other things, fund working capital requirements, invest in our business and other strategic opportunities, repay outstanding borrowings under our securitized debt, pay dividends and repurchase and retire shares of our common stock.
our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to service our debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described in item 1a. risk factors. there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our 2022 and 2021 variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness, or to make anticipated capital expenditures. our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our notes (defined below) and to service, extend or refinance our 2022 and 2021 variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
restricted cash as of december 31, 2023, we had $149.1 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents held for future principal and interest payments and other working capital requirements of our asset-backed securitization structure, $51.6 million of restricted cash equivalents held in a three-month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and $0.2 million of other restricted cash for a total of $200.9 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. as of december 31, 2023, we also held $88.2 million of advertising fund restricted cash and cash equivalents which can only be used for activities that promote the domino's brand.
long-term debt
2022 variable funding notes on september 16, 2022, certain of our subsidiaries issued a new variable funding note facility which allows for advances of up to $120.0 million of series 2022-1 variable funding senior secured notes, class a-1 notes (the "2022 variable funding notes"). additional information related to our 2022 variable funding notes is included in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.
2021 recapitalization on april 16, 2021, we completed the 2021 recapitalization in which certain of our subsidiaries issued notes pursuant to an asset-backed securitization. the notes consist of $850.0 million series 2021-1 2.662% fixed rate senior secured notes, class a-2-i with an anticipated term of 7.5 years (the "2021 7.5-year notes") and $1.0 billion series 2021-1 3.151% fixed rate senior secured notes, class a-2-ii with an anticipated term of 10 years (the "2021 ten-year notes", and, collectively with the 2021 7.5-year notes, the "2021 notes"). gross proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 notes were $1.85 billion.

2017 recapitalization on july 24, 2017, we completed the 2017 recapitalization in which certain of our subsidiaries issued notes pursuant to an asset-backed securitization. the notes consisted of $300.0 million series 2017-1 floating rate senior secured notes, class a-2-i with an anticipated term of five years (the "2017 floating rate notes"), $600.0 million series 2017-1 3.082% fixed rate senior secured notes, class a-2-ii with an anticipated term of five years (the "2017 five-year notes"), and $1.0 billion series 2017-1 4.118% fixed rate senior secured notes, class a-2-iii with an anticipated term of 10 years (the "2017 ten-year notes" and, collectively with the 2017 floating rate notes and the 2017 five-year notes, the "2017 notes"). the interest rate on the 2017 floating rate notes was payable at a rate equal to libor plus 125 basis points. gross proceeds from the issuance of the 2017 notes were $1.9 billion. the 2017 floating rate notes and the 2017 five-year notes were repaid in connection with the 2021 recapitalization. additional information related to the 2017 recapitalization is included in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.
2015 recapitalization on october 21, 2015, we completed the 2015 recapitalization in which certain of our subsidiaries issued notes pursuant to an asset-backed securitization. the notes consisted of $500.0 million of series 2015-1 3.484% fixed rate senior secured notes, class a-2-i (the "2015 five-year notes"), $800.0 million series 2015-1 4.474% fixed rate senior secured notes, class a-2-ii (the "2015 ten-year notes" and collectively with the 2015 five-year notes, the "2015 notes"). gross proceeds from the issuance of the 2015 notes were $1.3 billion. the 2015 five-year notes were repaid in connection with the 2018 recapitalization. additional information related to the 2015 recapitalization is included in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.
2021, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2015 notes the 2021 notes, 2019 notes, 2018 notes, 2017 notes and the 2015 notes are collectively referred to as the "notes."
the notes have original scheduled principal payments of $51.5 million in 2024, $1.17 billion in 2025, $39.3 million in 2026, $1.31 billion in 2027, $811.5 million in 2028, $625.9 million in 2029, $10.0 million in 2030 and $905.0 million in 2031. however, in accordance with our debt agreements, the payment of principal on the outstanding senior notes may be suspended if our leverage ratio is less than or equal to 5.0x total debt, as defined, to adjusted ebitda, as defined, and no catch-up provisions are applicable.
as of the fourth quarter of 2020, we had a leverage ratio of less than 5.0x, and accordingly, did not make the previously scheduled debt amortization payment beginning in the first quarter of 2021. subsequent to the closing of the 2021 recapitalization, the company had a leverage ratio of greater than 5.0x and, accordingly, the company resumed making the scheduled amortization payments in the second quarter of 2021.
the notes are subject to certain financial and non-financial covenants, including a debt service coverage ratio calculation. the covenant requires a minimum coverage ratio of 1.75x total debt service to securitized net cash flow, as defined in the related agreements. in the event that certain covenants are not met, the notes may become due and payable on an accelerated schedule.
leases we lease certain retail store and supply chain center locations, supply chain vehicles, various equipment and our world resource center under leases with expiration dates through 2045. refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our leases, including future minimum rental commitments.

operating activities cash provided by operating activities increased $115.5 million in 2023 primarily due to the positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $93.5 million. the positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily related to the timing of payments on accrued liabilities, accounts payable and income taxes, as well as the timing and pricing of inventory in 2023 as compared to 2022. additionally, net income increased $66.9 million and non-cash adjustments decreased $9.7 million, resulting in an overall increase to cash provided by operating activities in 2023 as compared to 2022 of $57.2 million. these increases in cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by a $35.2 million negative impact of changes in advertising fund assets and liabilities, restricted, in 2023 as compared to 2022 due to payments for advertising activities outpacing receipts from advertising contributions.

impact of inflation given the inflation rates in recent years, there have been and may continue to be increases in food costs and labor costs which have and could further impact our profitability and that of our franchisees and which could impact the opening of new u.s. and international franchised stores and adversely affect our operating results. factors such as inflation, increased food costs, increased labor and employee health and benefit costs, increased rent costs and increased energy costs may adversely affect our operating costs and profitability and those of our franchisees and could result in menu price increases. the impact of inflation is described with respect to our market basket pricing to stores and our labor cost, in the discussion of supply chain revenues and u.s. company-owned store and supply chain gross margins, above. severe increases in inflation could affect the global and u.s. economies and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. further discussion on the impact of commodities and other cost pressures is included above, as well as in item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.

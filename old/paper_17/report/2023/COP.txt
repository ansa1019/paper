item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10-k. these risk factors are not the only risks we face. our business could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. if any of these risks or other risks that are yet unknown or currently considered immaterial were to occur, our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as the value of an investment in our common stock, could be materially and adversely affected.
risks related to our industry our operating results, our ability to execute on our strategy and the carrying value of our assets are exposed to the effects of volatile commodity prices or prolonged periods of low commodity prices.
among the most significant factors impacting our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are the sales prices for crude oil, bitumen, lng, natural gas and ngl. these prices are tied to market prices that can fluctuate widely, and many of the factors influencing the prices are beyond our control. for example, over the course of 2023, wti crude oil prices ranged from a low of $67 per barrel in march to a high of $94 per barrel in august. given the volatility in commodity price drivers and the worldwide political and economic environment, including potential economic slowdowns or recessions, unexpected shocks to supply and demand resulting from future global health crises such as those experienced in connection with the covid-19 pandemic or increased uncertainty generated by recent (and potential future) armed hostilities in various oil-producing regions around the globe, prices for crude oil, bitumen, lng, natural gas and ngls may continue to be volatile.
prolonged periods of low commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating income, cash flows and liquidity, and may also affect the amount of dividends we elect to declare and pay on our common stock and the amount of shares we elect to acquire as part of our share repurchase program and the timing of such acquisitions. lower prices may also limit the amount of reserves we can produce economically, thus adversely affecting our proved reserves and reserve replacement ratio and accelerating the reduction in our existing reserve levels as we continue production from upstream fields. prolonged depressed prices may affect strategic decisions related to our operations, including decisions to reduce capital investments or curtail operated production.
significant reductions in crude oil, bitumen, lng, natural gas and ngl prices could also require us to reduce our capital expenditures, impair the carrying value of our assets or discontinue the classification of certain assets as proved reserves. although it is not reasonably practicable to quantify the impact of any future impairments or estimated change to our unit-of-production rates at this time, our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result.
unless we successfully develop resources, the scope of our business will decline, resulting in an adverse impact to our business.
as we produce crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and ngls from our existing portfolio, the amount of our remaining reserves declines. if we do not successfully replace the resources we produce with good prospects for future organic development or through acquisitions, our business will decline. in addition, our ability to successfully develop our reserves depends on our achievement of a number of operational and strategic objectives, some aspects of which are beyond our control, including navigating political and regulatory challenges to obtain and renew rights to develop and produce hydrocarbons; reservoir optimization; bringing long-lead time, capital intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; and efficiently and profitably operating mature properties. if we are not successful in developing the resources in our portfolio, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
the exploration and production of oil and gas is a highly competitive industry.
the exploration and production of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and ngls is a highly competitive business. we compete with private, public and state-owned companies in all facets of the exploration and production business, including to locate, acquire and develop new sources of supply and to produce crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and ngls in an efficient, cost-effective manner. in addition, as the energy transition progresses, we anticipate the oil and gas industry will face additional competition from alternative fuels. we must also compete for the materials, equipment, services, employees and other personnel (including geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other specialists) necessary to conduct our business. if we are not successful in any facet of this competition, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
conocophillips 2023 10-k risk factors our ability to successfully execute on our energy transition plans is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and may be costly to achieve.
in 2020, we announced our paris-aligned climate risk framework, including an ambition to achieve net-zero operational emissions by 2050. in 2022, we published our plan for the net-zero energy transition (the "plan") and continued to set increasingly ambitious targets around operational ghg emissions intensity and reducing methane emissions and flaring. our ability to achieve stated targets, goals and ambitions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties out of our control, government policies and markets, as well as potential regulations that may impair our ability to execute on current or future plans. such achievement also depends on the accelerated pace of development of effective emissions measurement and abatement technologies, and the actual pace of development may be inadequate, or the technologies actually developed may be insufficient. furthermore, we are still in the planning stages, and the plan's execution could be costly, may have unforeseen obstacles, may proceed at varying paces during the timeframe allotted for the plan and may be accomplished in a manner that we cannot predict at this time. we may be required to purchase emission credits in the future, and there may be an insufficient supply of offsets to achieve our goals, or we could incur increasingly greater expenses related to our purchase of such offsets. as advanced technologies are developed to accurately measure emissions, we may be required to revise our emissions estimates and reduction goals or otherwise revise our strategies outlined in the plan. we may be adversely affected and potentially need to reduce economic end-of-field life of certain assets and impair associated net book value due to the emissions intensity of some of our assets. even if we meet our goals, our efforts may be characterized as insufficient.
in 2021, we established our low-carbon technologies organization to identify and evaluate business opportunities that address end-use emissions and early-stage low-carbon technology opportunities that would leverage our existing expertise and adjacencies. our investments in these technologies may expose us to numerous financial, legal, operational, reputational and other risks. while we perform a thorough analysis on these investments, the related technologies and markets are at early stages of development and we do not yet know what rate of return we will achieve, if any. furthermore, we may not be able to deploy such technologies at a commercial scale. the success of our low-carbon strategy will depend in part upon the cooperation of government agencies, the support of stakeholders, our ability to research and forecast potential investments, and our ability to apply our existing strengths and expertise to new technologies, projects and markets.
estimates of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and ngl reserves are imprecise and may be subject to revision, and any material change in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and ngl reserves could impair the quantity and value of those reserves.
our proved reserve information included in this annual report represents management's best estimates based on assumptions, as of a specified date, of the volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and ngls. such volumes cannot be directly measured, and the estimates and underlying assumptions used by management are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. any material changes in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of these items could result in a material negative impact to the volume of reserves reported or could cause us to incur impairment expenses on property associated with the production of those reserves. future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation and commodity prices. for more information on estimates used, see the "critical accounting estimates" section of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
our business may be adversely affected by price controls; government-imposed limitations on production or exports of crude oil, bitumen, lng, natural gas and ngls; or the unavailability of adequate gathering, processing, compression, transportation, and pipeline facilities and equipment for our production of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and ngls.
as discussed herein, our operations are subject to extensive governmental regulations across numerous jurisdictions. from time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and ngl wells below actual production capacity. similarly, in response to increased domestic energy costs, circumstances determined to be in the economic interest of the country, or a declared national emergency, governments could restrict the export or import of our products which would adversely impact our business. because legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, we cannot predict whether future restrictions on our business may be enacted or become applicable to us.
conocophillips 2023 10-k risk factors our ability to sell and deliver the crude oil, bitumen, lng, natural gas and ngls that we produce also depends on the availability, proximity, and capacity of gathering, processing, compression, transportation and pipeline facilities and equipment, as well as any necessary diluents to prepare our crude oil, bitumen, lng, natural gas and ngls for transport. the facilities, equipment and diluents we rely on may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions, extreme weather events, permitting delays and other regulatory matters, mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions, many of which are beyond our control. in addition, in certain newer plays, the capacity of necessary facilities, equipment and diluents may not be sufficient to accommodate production from existing and new wells, and construction and permitting delays, permitting costs and regulatory or other constraints could limit or delay the construction, manufacture or other acquisition of new facilities and equipment. if any facilities, equipment or diluents, or any of the transportation methods and channels that we rely on become unavailable for any period of time, we may incur increased costs to transport our crude oil, bitumen, lng, natural gas and ngls for sale; we may be forced to curtail our production of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas or ngls or we may not be able to meet all the objectives in the plan, such as reducing routine flaring.
our ability to manage risk or influence outcomes in joint ventures may be constrained.
we conduct many of our operations through joint ventures in which another joint venture partner is operator or we may not have majority control. in these cases, the economic, business, or legal interests or goals of the operator or the voting majority may be inconsistent with ours, and we may not be able to influence the decision making or outcomes to align with our interests or goals. failure by an operator or a voting majority, with whom we have a joint venture interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with any operations could have an adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and operations.
our operations are subject to hazards and risks that require significant and continuous oversight.
our operations are subject to a variety of hazards and risks that require significant and continuous oversight, such as the monitoring, prevention or mitigation of or protection from explosions, fires, product spills, severe weather, geological events, global health crises, such as epidemics and pandemics, labor disputes, geopolitical tensions, armed hostilities, terrorist or piracy attacks, sabotage, civil unrest or cyberattacks. our operations are subject to additional hazards concerning exposure to and potential release of pollutants and toxic substances, as well as other environmental hazards and risks. for example, offshore activities may pose incrementally greater risks because of complex subsurface conditions such as higher reservoir pressures, water depths and metocean conditions. all such hazards could result in loss of human life, significant property and equipment damage, environmental pollution, impairment of operations, substantial losses to us and damage to our reputation. our business and operations may be disrupted if we do not respond, or are perceived not to respond, in an appropriate manner to any of these hazards and risks or any other major crisis or if we are unable to efficiently restore or replace affected operational components and capacity. countermeasures to address global health crises, epidemics or pandemics, including future outbreaks of covid-19, may result in reduced demand for our products; disruptions to our supply chain, the global economy or financial or commodity markets; disruptions in our contractual arrangements with our service providers, suppliers and other counterparties; failures by our suppliers, contract manufacturers, contractors, joint venture partners and external business partners, to meet their obligations to us; reduced workforce productivity; and voluntary or involuntary curtailments. further, our insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all resulting losses described above, and the cost to obtain adequate coverage may increase for us in the future or may not be available.
in addition, although we design and operate our business operations to accommodate expected climatic conditions, to the extent there are significant changes in the earth's climate, such as more severe or frequent weather conditions in the markets where we operate or the areas where our assets reside, we could incur increased expenses, our operations and supply chain could be adversely impacted and demand for our products could fall.
any of these factors, or other cascading effects of such factors, could materially increase our costs; negatively impact our revenues or ability to implement and advance the plan; and damage our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity position. the full extent and duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted at this time because of the lack of certainty surrounding their sources, causes and outcomes.
conocophillips 2023 10-k risk factors legal and regulatory risks we expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations.
our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, which are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations. for a description of the most significant of these environmental laws and regulations, see the "contingencies-environmental", "-climate change" and "-company response to climate-related risks" sections of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. these laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to, among other things:
•permits required in connection with exploration, drilling, production and other activities, including those issued by national, subnational, and local authorities;
•the discharge of pollutants into the environment;
•emissions into the atmosphere, such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury and ghg emissions, including methane;
•carbon taxes;
•the handling, use, storage, transportation, disposal and cleanup of hazardous materials and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes;
•the dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of historic properties and facilities at the end of their useful lives; and
•exploration and production activities in certain areas, such as offshore environments, arctic fields, oil sands reservoirs and unconventional plays.
we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations. in addition, to the extent these expenditures are assumed by a buyer as a result of a disposition, it may result in our incurring substantial costs if the buyer is unable to satisfy these obligations. any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with existing or future laws, regulations and other requirements could result in administrative or civil penalties, criminal fines, other enforcement actions or third-party litigation against us. to the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods as well as our ability to implement and advance the plan could be adversely affected.
existing and future laws, regulations and internal initiatives relating to global climate change, such as limitations on ghg emissions, may impact or limit our business plans, result in significant expenditures, promote alternative uses of energy or reduce demand for our products.
continuing political and societal attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit ghg emissions, such as cap and trade regimes, specific emission standards, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased fuel efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable and alternative energy. although we may support the intent of legislative and regulatory measures aimed at addressing climate-related risks, the specifics of how and when they are enacted could result in a material adverse effect to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods as well as our ability to implement and advance the plan.
for example, in december 2023, the epa published a final rule that revises the regulations governing, among other things, the emission of methane and volatile organic compounds from new oil and gas production facilities, and emission guidelines for states to use when revising clean air act implementation plans to limit methane emissions from existing oil and gas facilities. the final rule could result in additional capital expenditures and compliance, operating and maintenance costs, any of which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
additionally, in 2023, the u.s. joined the international community at the 28th conference of the parties (cop28), where the u.s. and nearly 200 other countries, including most of the countries in which we operate, renewed their commitment to deliver on the aims of the 2015 paris agreement. cop28 included a decision on the world's first 'global stocktake' to ratchet up climate action before the end of the decade - including a goal to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030 - and for the first time its final agreement explicitly recommended "transitioning away from fossil fuels in the energy system." the implementation of current agreements and regulatory measures, as well as any future agreements or measures addressing climate change and ghg emissions, may adversely increase our capital and operating expenses, conocophillips 2023 10-k risk factors impact the demand for our products, impose taxes on our products or operations, or require us to purchase emission credits or reduce emissions of ghgs from our operations. for example, in august 2022, the u.s. enacted the inflation reduction act of 2022, which includes a charge on methane emissions from selected facilities in the oil and gas industry, including many of the facilities operated by conocophillips. as a result, we may incur substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs, any of which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
for more information on legislation or precursors for possible regulation relating to global climate change that affect or could affect our operations and a description of the company's response, see the "contingencies-climate change" and "-company response to climate-related risks" sections of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
broader investor and societal attention to and efforts to address global climate change may limit who can do business with us or our access to financial markets and could subject us to litigation.
increasing attention to global climate change has also resulted in pressure from and upon stockholders, financial institutions and other financial market participants to potentially limit or discontinue investments, insurance and funding to oil and gas companies. for example, a significant number of financial institutions are now members of the glasgow financial alliance for net zero (gfanz), thereby pledging to the goal of net zero by 2050, as well as setting interim targets for 2030 or earlier. while they are not prohibited from doing business with oil and gas companies, gfanz members may self-impose limits. conversely, we also face pressure from some in the investment community and certain public interest groups to limit the focus on esg in our decision-making, arguing that esg considerations do not relate to financial outcomes. as public pressure continues to mount on the financial sector, our costs of capital may increase.
furthermore, increasing attention to global climate change has resulted in an increased likelihood of governmental investigations and private litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. beginning in 2017 and continuing through 2023, cities, counties, governments and other entities in several states/territories in the u.s. have filed lawsuits against oil and gas companies, including conocophillips, seeking compensatory damages and equitable relief to abate alleged climate change impacts. additional lawsuits with similar allegations are expected to be filed. the amounts claimed by plaintiffs are unspecified and the legal and factual issues involved in these cases are unprecedented. conocophillips believes these lawsuits are factually and legally meritless, and are an inappropriate vehicle to address the challenges associated with climate change and will vigorously defend against such lawsuits. the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, and we expect to incur substantial legal costs associated with defending these and similar lawsuits in the future. we could also receive lawsuits alleging a failure or lack of diligence to meet our publicly stated esg goals, or alleging misrepresentation related to our esg activity.
political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows.
actions of the u.s., state, local and foreign governments, through sanctions, tax and other legislation, executive orders and commercial restrictions, could reduce our operating profitability both in the u.s. and abroad. in certain locations, restrictions on our operations; leasing restrictions; special taxes or tax assessments; and payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive information or might cause us to violate non-disclosure laws of other countries have been imposed or proposed by governments or certain interest groups. in addition, we may face regulatory changes in the u.s. including, but not limited to, the enactment of tax law changes that adversely affect the fossil fuel industry, new methane emissions standards, requirements restricting or prohibiting flaring and subsurface water disposal, more stringent environmental impact studies and reviews and policies inhibiting or curtailing lng exports. similar regulatory shifts, including attendant higher costs and market access constraints, may also occur in international jurisdictions in which we operate.
hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations, has historically attracted political and regulatory scrutiny. a range of local, state, federal and national laws and regulations currently govern, constrain or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in some jurisdictions. new or more stringent permitting, disclosure or other regulatory requirements on hydraulic fracturing or other oil and natural gas operations, including subsurface water disposal, could result in increased costs, operating restrictions or operational delays or could limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources.
in addition, certain interest groups have also proposed ballot initiatives, contested lease sales and challenged project permits, for example, to restrict oil and natural gas development generally as well as specific projects, including the conocophillips 2023 10-k risk factors willow project in alaska. in the event that ballot initiatives, local, state, or national restrictions or prohibitions are adopted and result in more stringent limitations on the production and development of oil and natural gas in areas where we conduct operations, we may incur significant costs to comply with such requirements or may experience delays or curtailment in the permitting or pursuit of exploration, development or production activities. such compliance costs and delays, curtailments, limitations or prohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and ability to implement and advance the plan.
political and economic factors in international markets could have a material adverse effect on us.
approximately 31 percent of our hydrocarbon production was derived from production outside the u.s. in 2023, and 33 percent of our proved reserves, as of december 31, 2023, were located outside the u.s. we are subject to risks associated with our operations in foreign jurisdictions and international markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to crude oil, bitumen, lng, natural gas or ngl pricing and taxation; other regulatory or economic developments (including the macro effects of international trade policies and disputes); disruptive geopolitical conditions, and international monetary and currency rate fluctuations. for example, in december 2022, in response to higher energy prices resulting from the conflict between russia and ukraine, australia's parliament passed legislation setting a one-year price cap on natural gas. further legislation was introduced in 2023 that extends the price cap through to at least june 2025, subject to further review and certain exemptions. restrictions on production of oil and gas could increase to the extent governments view such measures as a viable approach for pursuing national and global energy security and climate policies. the escalation of geopolitical tension in the middle east in late 2023 and early 2024 underscores the continued relevance of this consideration. in addition, some countries where we operate lack a fully independent judiciary system. this, coupled with changes in foreign law or policy, results in a lack of legal certainty that exposes our operations to increased risks, including increased difficulty in enforcing our agreements in those jurisdictions and increased risks of adverse actions by local government authorities, such as expropriations. actions by host governments, such as the expropriation of our oil assets by the venezuelan government, have affected operations significantly in the past and may continue to do so in the future.
in addition, the u.s. government has the authority to prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign jurisdictions or with certain parties. these restrictions and similar restrictions imposed by foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various jurisdictions. diplomatic relations or policies between the u.s. government and one or more foreign jurisdictions may impair our ability to collect awards in legal actions against such foreign jurisdictions. changes in domestic and international policies and regulations may also restrict our ability to obtain or maintain licenses or permits necessary to operate in foreign jurisdictions, including those necessary for drilling and development of wells. similarly, the declaration of a "climate emergency" could result in actions to limit exports of our products and other restrictions.
any of these actions could adversely affect our business or operating results, including our ability to implement and advance the plan.
other risk factors facing our business or operations we may need additional capital in the future, and it may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.
we have historically relied primarily upon cash generated by our business to fund our operations and strategy; however, we have also relied from time to time on access to the capital markets for funding. there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all. in addition, although we anticipate we will be able to repay our existing indebtedness when it matures or in accordance with our stated plans, there can be no assurance we will be able to do so. our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance our existing indebtedness when it matures or in accordance with our plans, will be subject to a number of factors, including market conditions, our operating performance, investor sentiment, risks impacting financial institutions and the credit markets more broadly and financial institution policies regarding the oil and gas industry. if we are unable to generate sufficient funds from operations or raise additional capital for any reason, our business could be adversely affected.
in addition, we are regularly evaluated by the major rating agencies based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and conditions affecting the oil and gas industry generally. we and other industry companies have had our ratings reduced in the past due to negative commodity price outlooks. these major rating agencies are now considering esg attributes when assessing credit profiles. while these assessments have limited impact today, they have the potential to pressure credit ratings over time. any downgrade in our credit rating or announcement that our credit rating is under review for possible downgrade could increase the cost associated with any additional indebtedness we incur.
conocophillips 2023 10-k risk factors our business may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of, or defaults under our contracts with, third-parties with whom we do business.
the operation of our business requires us to engage in transactions with numerous counterparties operating in a variety of industries, including other companies operating in the oil and gas industry. these counterparties may default on their obligations to us as a result of operational failures or a lack of liquidity, or for other reasons, including bankruptcy. market speculation about the credit quality of these counterparties, or their ability to continue performing on their existing obligations, may also exacerbate any operational difficulties or liquidity issues they are experiencing. any default by any of our counterparties may result in our inability to perform our obligations under agreements we have made with third-parties or may otherwise adversely affect our business or results of operations. in addition, our rights against any of our counterparties as a result of a default may not be adequate to compensate us for the resulting harm caused or may not be enforceable at all in some circumstances. we may also be forced to incur additional costs as we attempt to enforce any rights we have against a defaulting counterparty, which could further adversely impact our results of operations.
our ability to execute our capital return program is subject to certain considerations.
in december 2021, we initiated a three-tier capital return program that consists of our ordinary dividend, share repurchases and a variable return of cash (vroc).
ordinary dividends are authorized and determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion and depend upon a number of factors, including:
•cash available for distribution;
•our results of operations and anticipated future results of operations;
•our financial condition, especially in relation to the anticipated future capital needs of our properties;
•the level of distributions paid by comparable companies;
•our operating expenses; and
•other factors our board of directors deems relevant.
vroc distributions are also authorized and determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion and depend upon a number of factors, including:
•the anticipated level of distributions required to meet our capital returns commitment;
•forward prices;
•the amount of cash we hold;
•total yield; and
•other factors our board of directors deems relevant.
we expect to continue to pay a quarterly ordinary dividend to our stockholders. in addition, based on the current environment, we anticipate also paying a quarterly vroc to our shareholders; however, the amount of dividends and vroc is variable and will depend upon the above factors, and our board of directors may determine not to pay a dividend or vroc in a quarter or may cease declaring a dividend or vroc at any time. since the inception of the three-tier return of capital program, the vroc has both increased and decreased across quarters, and it may continue to fluctuate in the future.
additionally, as of december 31, 2023, $16.2 billion of repurchase authority remained of the $45 billion share repurchase program our board of directors had authorized. our share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire a specific number of shares during any period, and our decision to commence, discontinue or resume repurchases in any period will depend on the same factors that our board of directors may consider when declaring dividends, among other factors. in the past we have suspended our share repurchase program in response to market downturns, including as a result of the oil market downturn that began in early 2020, and we may do so again in the future.
any downward revision in the amount of our ordinary dividend or vroc or the volume of shares we purchase under our share repurchase program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.
conocophillips 2023 10-k risk factors there are substantial risks with any acquisitions or divestitures we have completed or that we may choose to undertake.
we regularly review our portfolio and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest noncore assets or businesses. we may not be able to complete these transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. even if we do complete such transactions, our cash flow from operations may be adversely impacted or otherwise the transactions may not result in the benefits anticipated due to various risks, including, but not limited to (i) the failure of the acquired assets or businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, including risk of impairment; (ii) the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions; and (iii) the discovery of unknown and unforeseen liabilities or other issues related to any acquisition for which contractual protections are inadequate or we lack insurance or indemnities, including environmental liabilities, or with regard to divested assets or businesses, claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification. in addition, we may face difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of any acquired assets or businesses.
our technologies, systems and networks are subject to cybersecurity threats.
our business is faced with growing cybersecurity threats as we increasingly rely on digital technologies across our business. cybersecurity risks to our business, including our suppliers, third-party service providers, contractors, joint venture partners and external business partners, include but are not limited to:
•unauthorized access to, or control of or disclosure of sensitive information about our business and our employees;
•compromise of our data or systems, including corruption, sabotage, encryption or acts that otherwise render our data or systems unusable (or those of third-parties with whom we do business, including third-party cloud and information technology (it) service providers);
•theft or manipulation of our proprietary information;
•ransom;
•extortion;
•threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure; and
•cyber terrorism.
in addition, we have exposure to cybersecurity risks where our data and proprietary information are collected, hosted, and/or processed by third-party cloud and service providers. our risks may be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cybersecurity incident or understand the full extent of such incident notwithstanding our risk management processes and controls. we face risks associated with new and ever-increasing phishing techniques, hidden malware, as well as risks associated with electronic data proliferation and technology digitization. we also face increased risk with the increased sophistication of generative artificial intelligence capabilities, which may improve or expand the existing capabilities of cybercriminals described above in a manner we cannot predict at this time.
our increasing reliance on it in our production, distribution and marketing systems may allow cybersecurity threats to disrupt our oil and gas operations, both domestically and abroad.
if our data, it, operational technology (ot), including industrial control and supervisory control and data acquisition (scada) systems were to be breached, damaged or disrupted due to a cybersecurity incident or cyber-attack (directly, indirectly through third-parties or through the it networks, servers, software, or infrastructure on which they rely), we could be subject to serious negative consequences. these consequences could include physical damage to production, distribution or storage assets; delay or prevention of delivery to markets; disruption or prevention of accurate accounting for production and settlement of transactions; negative impacts on public health, safety, the environment, economic security, or national security; financial impacts; business interruption; reputational damage; loss of employee, supplier, contractor, partner and/or public trust; reimbursement or other costs; increased compliance costs; regulatory investigations; litigation exposure and legal liability or regulatory fines; penalties or other external intervention.
although we have business continuity plans in place, our operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our systems and infrastructure that support our business. further, our ability to insure against cybersecurity risks may be limited by the availability and increasing expense of sufficient coverage.
for additional information regarding our cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance, see item 1c. cybersecurity.

business environment and executive overview conocophillips is one of the world's leading e&p companies based on both production and reserves with operations and activities in 13 countries. our diverse, low cost of supply portfolio includes resource-rich unconventional plays in north america; conventional assets in north america, europe, africa and asia; global lng developments; oil sands in canada; and an inventory of global exploration prospects. headquartered in houston, texas, at december 31, 2023, we employed approximately 9,900 people worldwide and had total assets of $96 billion.
overview at conocophillips, we anticipate that commodity prices will continue to be cyclical and volatile, and our view is that a successful business strategy in the e&p industry must be resilient in lower price environments while also retaining upside during periods of higher prices. as such, we are unhedged, remain committed to our disciplined investment framework and continually monitor market fundamentals, including the impacts associated with geopolitical tensions and conflicts, opec plus supply updates, global demand for our products, oil and gas inventory levels, governmental policies, inflation and supply chain disruptions.
the macro-environment of the global energy industry, including the energy transition, continues to evolve. we believe conocophillips will continue to play an essential role by executing on three objectives: responsibly meeting energy transition pathway demand, delivering competitive returns on and of capital and achieving our net-zero operational emissions ambition. we call this our triple mandate, and it represents our commitment to create long-term value for our stakeholders.
our triple mandate and our foundational principles guide our differential value proposition to deliver competitive returns to stockholders through price cycles. our foundational principles consist of maintaining balance sheet strength, providing peer-leading distributions, making disciplined investments, and demonstrating responsible and reliable esg performance.
total company production in 2023 was 1,826 mboed, yielding cash provided by operating activities of $20 billion. we invested $11.2 billion into the business in the form of capital expenditures and investments and provided returns of capital to shareholders of approximately $11 billion through our ordinary dividend, share repurchases and our vroc. for 2023, we returned $2.6 billion from our ordinary dividend, which included an increase from 51 cents per share to 58 cents per share, effective in december. we also returned $3.0 billion to shareholders from the vroc in 2023. in total for 2023, we returned $5.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases. as of december 31, 2023, we have repurchased $28.8 billion of the $45 billion authorized share repurchase program. in february 2024, we announced our 2024 planned return of capital to shareholders of $9 billion through our three-tier return of capital framework. we also declared a first quarter ordinary dividend of 58 cents per share and a vroc of 20 cents per share.
in march, the department of interior published its rod approving our willow project in alaska, which adopted a plan consisting of three core pads. in december, following a ninth circuit court of appeals denial of a request for an injunction, we reached fid on the willow project and began winter construction.
conocophillips 2023 10-k management's discussion and analysis in october, we completed our acquisition of the remaining 50 percent working interest in surmont, an asset in our canada segment, for $2.7 billion of cash after customary adjustments. the transaction was funded by proceeds received via long-term debt offerings. this transaction includes a contingent payment arrangement of up to an additional $0.4 billion cad (approximately $0.3 billion) over a five-year term. as the 100 percent owner and operator of surmont, we will seek to optimize the asset while remaining on track to achieve our previously announced corporate emissions intensity objectives. see note 3.
in 2023, we took several steps to further our global lng business. in march, we completed our acquisition of 30 percent equity interest in palng phase 1. in june, we completed our acquisition of a 25 percent equity interest in nfs3 in qatar. additionally, in june, we signed a 20-year offtake agreement at the saguaro lng export facility on the west coast of mexico, subject to mexico pacific reaching fid and other certain conditions precedent. furthermore, in september, we signed a 15-year throughput agreement securing regasification capacity at the gate lng terminal in the netherlands. see note 3.
in the second quarter of 2023, we completed a strategic debt refinancing that extends the weighted average maturity of our portfolio from 15 to 17 years and reduces near term debt maturities. see note 9.
in april, we announced that we are accelerating our operations ghg emissions intensity reduction target through 2030. we are now targeting a reduction in gross operated and net equity operational emissions intensity of 50-60 percent from 2016 levels by 2030, an improvement from the previously announced target of 40-50 percent. in december, we achieved the gold standard pathway in the oil and gas methane partnership (ogmp) 2.0 initiative. for more information on our commitment to esg and the plan, see "contingencies-company response to climate-related risks" section of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation.
operationally, we remain focused on safely executing the business. our lower 48 segment achieved record production in 2023. our international projects reached several key operational milestones, including first production ahead of schedule at several subsea projects in norway and china, as well as the startup of the second phase of montney's central processing facility in canada. production for 2023 was 1,826 mboed, representing an increase of 88 mboed or 5 percent compared to 2022. after adjusting for closed acquisitions and dispositions, production increased by 73 mboed or 4 percent.
key operating and financial summary significant items during 2023 and recent announcements included the following:

conocophillips 2023 10-k management's discussion and analysis business environment the energy industry has historically been subject to volatility in commodity prices, which fluctuate with the global economy's supply and demand for energy. for example, wti crude oil prices averaged $78 per barrel in 2023, compared with $94 per barrel in 2022. our profitability, reinvestment of cash flows and distributions to shareholders are influenced by these fluctuations. our triple mandate and foundational principles guide our differential value proposition to deliver competitive returns on and of capital to stockholders through price cycles. our foundational principles consist of maintaining balance sheet strength, providing peer-leading distributions, making disciplined investments and demonstrating responsible and reliable esg performance, all of which support strong financial returns and mitigate uncertainty associated with volatile commodity prices.
•balance sheet strength. a strong balance sheet is a strategic asset that provides flexibility through price cycles. we strive to maintain our 'a'-rating, as we did throughout 2023. in 2023, we initiated and completed a strategic debt refinancing to extend the weighted average maturity of our portfolio and reduced near-term debt maturities. in addition, we also funded the acquisition of the remaining 50 percent working interest in surmont from the proceeds of new long-term debt issuances. we ended the year with cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $5.9 billion and short-term investments of $1.0 billion, maintaining balance sheet strength.
•peer leading distributions. we believe in delivering value to our shareholders via our three-tiered return of capital framework, which consists of a growing, sustainable ordinary dividend, share repurchases and our vroc. this framework is how we plan to return greater than 30 percent of our net cash provided by operating activities to shareholders. in 2023, we returned $5.6 billion to shareholders through our ordinary dividend and vroc and $5.4 billion through share repurchases. our combined dividends and share repurchases of $11 billion represented over 50 percent of our net cash provided by operating activities. in february 2024, we announced our 2024 planned return of capital to shareholders of $9 billion through our three-tier return of capital framework. see "item 1a-risk factors our ability to execute our capital return program is subject to certain considerations."
•disciplined investments. our goal is to achieve strong free cash flow by exercising capital discipline, controlling our costs, and safely and reliably delivering production. we expect to make capital investments sufficient to at least sustain production throughout the price cycles. free cash flow is defined as cash from operations net of capital expenditures and investments and provides funds that are available to return to shareholders, strengthen the balance sheet or reinvest back into the business for future cash flow expansion.
◦exercise capital discipline. we participate in a commodity price-driven and capital-intensive industry, with varying lead times from when an investment decision is made to when an asset is operational and generates cash flow. as a result, we must invest significant capital to develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields and construct pipelines and lng facilities. we allocate capital across a geographically diverse, low cost of supply resource base, which combined with legacy assets results in low overall production decline. cost of supply is the wti equivalent price that generates a 10 percent after-tax return on a point-forward and fully burdened basis. fully burdened basis includes capital infrastructure, foreign currency exchange rates, cost of carbon, price-related inflation and g&a. in setting our capital plans, we exercise a rigorous approach that evaluates projects using these cost of supply criteria, which we believe will lead to value maximization and cash flow expansion using an optimized investment pace, not production growth for growth's sake. our cash allocation priorities call for the investment of sufficient capital to sustain production and provide returns of capital to shareholders.
◦control our costs. controlling our costs, without compromising safety or environmental stewardship, is a high priority. using various methodologies, we monitor costs monthly, on an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis and report to management. managing costs is critical to maintaining a competitive position in our industry, particularly in a low commodity price environment, and positively impacts our ability to deliver strong cash from operations.
◦optimize our portfolio. we continue to evaluate our assets to determine whether they compete for capital within our portfolio and optimize as necessary, directing capital towards the most competitive investments and disposing of assets that do not compete.
in 2023, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 50 percent working interest in surmont and completed our acquisitions of equity interests in both the palng and nfs3 lng projects and signed both lng offtake and regasification agreements. see note 3.
conocophillips 2023 10-k management's discussion and analysis
◦add to our proved reserve base. we primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways:
▪acquire interest in existing or new fields.
▪apply new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields.
▪successfully explore, develop and exploit new and existing fields.
as required by authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will reach the end of its economic life is based on historical 12-month first-of-month average prices and current costs. this date estimates when production will end and affects the amount of estimated reserves. therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise.
reserve replacement represents the net change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by our current year production, as shown in our supplemental reserve table disclosures. our reserve replacement was 123 percent in 2023, reflecting a net increase from development drilling activity, extensions and discoveries and purchases, partially offset by lower prices. our organic reserve replacement, which excludes a net increase of 184 mmboe from sales and purchases, was 96 percent in 2023.
in the three years ended december 31, 2023, our reserve replacement was 219 percent. our organic reserve replacement during the three years ended december 31, 2023, which excludes a net increase of 1,293 mmboe related to sales and purchases, was 152 percent. see "supplementary data - oil and gas operations" for more information.
access to additional resources may become increasingly difficult as lower commodity price cycles can make projects uneconomic or unattractive. in addition, prohibition of direct investment in some nations, national fiscal terms, political instability, competition from national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. as such, the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to fully replace our production over subsequent years.
see "item 1a-risk factors - unless we successfully develop resources, the scope of our business will decline, resulting in an adverse impact to our business."
•environmental, social and governance performance. we seek to fulfill our mission of delivering energy to the world through an integrated management system that assesses sustainability-related business risks and opportunities as part of our decision-making process. recognizing the importance of esg performance to our stakeholders and company success, we have a governance structure that extends from the board of directors through to executive leadership and business unit managers.
in october 2020, we became the first u.s.-based oil and natural gas company to adopt a paris-aligned climate risk framework that includes an ambition to achieve net-zero scope 1 and 2 emissions on a gross operated and net equity basis by 2050. we believe that this framework, combined with our success in meeting the business objectives set by our triple mandate, represents the most effective way for us to sustainably contribute to society's transition to a low-carbon economy. in 2023, we announced an acceleration of our operational ghg emissions intensity reduction target through 2030. in december, we achieved the gold standard pathway in the ogmp 2.0 initiative.
we believe that natural gas and oil will remain essential to the energy mix throughout the energy transition, and we also recognize the need for continuous reduction in the greenhouse gas intensity of production operations. the energy transition will likely be complex, evolving over multiple decades with many possible pathways and uncertainties. by following our triple mandate, we intend to meet this challenge in an economically viable, accountable and actionable way that creates long-term value for our stakeholders. for more information on our commitment to responsible and reliable esg performance through the energy transition, see "contingencies-company response to climate-related risks" section of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation.
conocophillips 2023 10-k management's discussion and analysis commodity prices our earnings and operating cash flows generally correlate with crude oil and natural gas commodity prices. commodity price levels are subject to factors external to the company and over which we have no control, including but not limited to global economic health, supply or demand disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil unrest, global pandemics, military conflicts, actions taken by opec plus and other major oil producing countries, environmental laws, tax regulations, governmental policies and weather-related disruptions. the following graph depicts the average benchmark prices for wti crude oil, brent crude oil and u.s. henry hub natural gas since 2021:
brent crude oil prices averaged $82.62 per barrel in 2023, a decrease of 18 percent compared with $101.19 per barrel in 2022. similarly, average wti crude oil prices decreased 18 percent from $94.23 per barrel in 2022 to $77.62 per barrel in 2023. prices were lower through 2023 as rising non-opec supplies and russia's ability to redirect crude oil to destinations outside the eu more than offset opec plus crude oil supply curbs.
henry hub natural gas prices decreased 59 percent from an average of $6.65 per mmbtu in 2022 to $2.74 per mmbtu in 2023. natural gas prices decreased due to mild winter weather and u.s. domestic supply growth outpacing demand growth.
our realized bitumen price decreased 24 percent from an average of $55.56 per barrel in 2022 to $42.15 per barrel in 2023. the decrease was largely driven by weakness in wti, reflective of global markets adjusting to new trade dynamics and global crude oil demand concerns. we continue to optimize bitumen price realizations through optimizing diluent recovery unit operation, blending and transportation strategies.
our worldwide annual average realized price decreased 27 percent from $79.82 per boe in 2022 to $58.39 per boe in 2023 primarily due to lower commodity prices.

the alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, ngls and natural gas. in 2023, alaska contributed 15 percent of our consolidated liquids production and two percent of our consolidated natural gas production.
net income (loss)
alaska reported earnings of $1,778 million in 2023, compared with earnings of $2,352 million in 2022. earnings were negatively impacted by:
•lower realized crude oil prices.
•higher production and operating expenses due to higher well work and transportation related costs.
•higher dd&a expenses due to higher rates primarily as a result of downward reserve revisions.
earnings were positively impacted by lower taxes other than income taxes associated with lower realized crude oil prices.
production average production decreased 5 mboed in 2023 compared with 2022, primarily due to normal field decline.
the production decrease was partly offset by new wells online at our western north slope and greater kuparuk area assets.
exploration activity in the first quarter of 2023, we drilled the bear-1 exploration well which was determined to be a dry hole, increasing exploration expenses by approximately $31 million before-tax. the well, located south of the kuparuk river unit and east of the colville river on state lands, is in an area that we are continuing to evaluate. see note 6.
willow update in march 2023, the department of interior published its rod approving our willow project in alaska, which adopted a plan consisting of three core pads. in december, following a ninth circuit court of appeals denial of a request for an injunction, we reached fid on the willow project and began winter construction.

net income (loss)
lower 48 reported earnings of $6,461 million in 2023, compared with earnings of $11,015 million in 2022. earnings were negatively impacted by:
•lower realized commodity prices.
•higher dd&a expenses primarily due to higher rates from reserve revisions resulting from higher operating costs as well as higher production volumes.
•higher production and operating expenses primarily due to higher production volumes and increased well work activity.
earnings were positively impacted by:
•higher sales volumes.
•improved commercial performance and timing.
•lower taxes other than income taxes driven by lower realized prices, partially offset by higher production volumes.
production total average production increased 78 mboed in 2023 compared with 2022, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in delaware basin, midland basin, eagle ford and bakken.

net income (loss)
canada operations reported earnings of $402 million in 2023 compared with earnings of $714 million in 2022. earnings were negatively impacted by:
•lower realized commodity prices.
•absence of contingent payments received associated with the prior sale of certain assets to cve. the term of cve contingent payments ended in the second quarter of 2022.
earnings were positively impacted by:
•higher sales volumes primarily related to our surmont acquisition which closed in october 2023. see note 3.
•absence of prior year exploration expenses related to the impairment of certain aged, suspended wells. see note 6.
•a $92 million tax benefit recognized upon the closing of a canada revenue agency audit. see note 17.
production total average production increased 19 mboed in 2023 compared with 2022. the production increase was primarily due to:
•higher volumes due to our surmont acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2023. see note 3.

to meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources, including cash generated from operating activities, proceeds from asset sales, our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our ability to sell securities using our shelf registration statement. in 2023, the primary uses of our available cash were $11.2 billion to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program, $2.7 billion for the acquisition of an additional 50 percent working interest in surmont, $5.4 billion to repurchase common stock, and $5.6 billion to pay the ordinary dividend and vroc. in addition to cash from operating activities, the other primary sources of additional capital were $2.7 billion in proceeds from long-term debt issuances to fund the surmont acquisition and $1.4 billion net sales of short-term investments. in 2023, cash and cash equivalents decreased by $0.8 billion to $5.6 billion. see note 9.
at december 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $5.6 billion, short-term investments of $1.0 billion, and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility of $5.5 billion, totaling approximately $12.1 billion of liquidity. we believe current cash balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the "significant changes in capital" section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near- and long-term, including our capital spending program, dividend payments and required debt payments.
significant changes in capital operating activities cash provided by operating activities in 2023 totaled $20.0 billion, compared with $28.3 billion for 2022, and $17.0 billion for 2021. the decrease in cash provided by operating activities from 2022 is primarily due to lower realized commodity prices across all products, partly offset by higher sales volumes, net of associated production and operating costs.
the increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2022 compared to 2021 is primarily due to higher realized commodity prices, higher sales volumes mostly due to our acquisition of shell permian assets and the absence of the 2021 settlement of oil and gas hedging positions acquired from concho. the increase in cash provided by operating activities was partly offset by foreign tax and royalty payments in libya and foreign tax payments in norway in addition to u.s. tax payments.
our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, lng and ngls. prices and margins in our industry have historically been volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows.
conocophillips 2023 10-k capital resources and liquidity the level of absolute production volumes, as well as product and location mix, is another significant factor impacting our cash flows. full-year production averaged 1,826 mboed in 2023, an increase of 88 mboed or 5 percent compared to 2022. first quarter 2024 production is expected to be 1.88 mmboed to 1.92 mmboed. future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; acquisition and disposition of fields; field production decline rates; new technologies; operating efficiencies; timing of startups and major turnarounds; political instability; weather-related disruptions; and the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost-effective development. while we actively monitor and manage these factors, changes in production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although we generally experience less variability in our cash flows due to changes in production levels than due to changes in commodity prices.
to maintain or grow our production volumes on an ongoing basis, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. our estimates of our proved reserves generally increase as of a specified date as prices rise and decrease as prices decline. reserve replacement represents the net change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by our current year production. for information on proved reserves, including both developed and undeveloped reserves, see the reserve table disclosures contained in "supplementary data - oil and gas operations." see "item 1a-risk factors - unless we successfully develop resources, the scope of our business will decline, resulting in an adverse impact to our business."
as discussed in the "critical accounting estimates" section, engineering estimates of proved reserves are imprecise; therefore, reserves may be revised upward or downward each year due to the impact of changes in commodity prices or as more technical data becomes available on reservoirs. it is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact future reserve quantities.
investing activities in 2023, we invested $11.2 billion in capital expenditures and investments; $1.5 billion of which was primarily payments towards our investments in lng projects, including palng, nfe4 and nfs3. see note 3. the remaining $9.7 billion funded our operating capital program. capital expenditures invested in 2022 and 2021 were $10.2 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively. see the "capital expenditures and investments" section.
in october 2023, we acquired the remaining 50 percent working interest in surmont from totalenergies ep canada ltd. for approximately $2.7 billion of cash after customary adjustments. we funded this transaction by issuing new long-term debt. see note 3 and note 9.
proceeds from asset sales were $0.6 billion in 2023 compared with $3.5 billion in 2022. in 2022, we received proceeds of $1.4 billion for the sale of our remaining 91 million common shares of cve, proceeds of approximately $1.5 billion, primarily from asset divestitures in our asia pacific and lower 48 segments, and $0.5 billion in contingent payments associated with prior divestitures. see note 3 and note 5.
in december 2021, we completed our acquisition of shell's assets in the delaware basin for cash consideration of approximately $8.7 billion after customary adjustments. we funded this transaction with cash on hand. we completed our acquisition of concho on january 15, 2021 in an all-stock transaction. the assets acquired in the transaction included $382 million of cash. the net impact of these items is recognized within "acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired" on our consolidated statement of cash flows. see note 3.
in 2021, total proceeds from asset dispositions were $1.7 billion. we received cash proceeds of $250 million from the sale of noncore assets in our lower 48 segment, $1.1 billion from sales of our investment in cve common shares and $244 million of contingent payments related to dispositions completed before 2021. see note 3 and note 5.
we invest in short-term investments as part of our cash investment strategy, the primary objective of which is to protect principal, maintain liquidity and provide yield and total returns; these investments include time deposits, commercial paper, as well as debt securities classified as available for sale. funds for short-term needs to support our operating plan and provide resiliency to react to short-term price volatility are invested in highly liquid instruments with maturities within the year. funds we consider available to maintain resiliency in longer term price downturns and to capture opportunities outside a given operating plan may be invested in instruments with maturities greater than one year. see note 12 and note 19.
investing activities in 2023 included net sales of $1,373 million of investments. we had net sales of $2,111 million of short-term instruments and net purchases of $738 million of long-term instruments. see note 19.
conocophillips 2023 10-k capital resources and liquidity financing activities our debt balance at december 31, 2023 was $18.9 billion compared with $16.6 billion at december 31, 2022. the current portion of debt, including payments for finance leases, is $1.1 billion. in 2023, we issued $2.7 billion principal amount of new debt to fund our acquisition of the remaining 50 percent working interest in surmont and completed refinancing transactions consisting of $1.1 billion in tender offers to repurchase existing debt with cash and a $1.1 billion new debt issuance to fund the repurchases, extending the weighted average maturity of our portfolio from 15 to 17 years and reducing near-term debt maturities. see note 9.
in 2022, we repurchased notes, retired floating rate debt, and executed a debt refinancing comprised of concurrent transactions including new debt issuances, a cash tender offer and debt exchange offers. in aggregate, these transactions along with naturally maturing debt, reduced the company's total debt by $3.3 billion.
in 2022, we refinanced our revolving credit facility from a total aggregate principal amount of $6.0 billion to $5.5 billion with an expiration date of february 2027. our revolving credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, the issuance of letters of credit totaling up to $500 million, or as support for our commercial paper program. the revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or credit ratings. the facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by conocophillips, or any of its consolidated subsidiaries. the amount of the facility is not subject to redetermination prior to its expiration date.
credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above the secured overnight financing rate (sofr). the agreement calls for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. the agreement also contains early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the board of directors.
the revolving credit facility supports conocophillips company's ability to issue up to $5.5 billion of commercial paper, which is primarily a funding source for short-term working capital needs. commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. with no commercial paper outstanding and no direct borrowings or letters of credit, we had access to $5.5 billion in available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at december 31, 2023.
in december 2023, fitch affirmed our long-term credit ratings. the current credit ratings on our long-term debt are:
•fitch: "a" with a "stable" outlook
•s&p: "a-" with a "stable" outlook
•moody's: "a2" with a "stable" outlook see note 9 for additional information on debt and the revolving credit facility.
we do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our access to liquidity, upon downgrade of our credit ratings. if our credit ratings are downgraded from their current levels, it could increase the cost of corporate debt available to us and restrict our access to the commercial paper markets. if our credit rating were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our revolving credit facility.
certain of our project-related contracts, commercial contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions requiring us to post collateral. many of these contracts and instruments permit us to post either cash or letters of credit as collateral. at december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, we had direct bank letters of credit of $340 million and $368 million, respectively, which secured performance obligations related to various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business. in the event of a credit rating downgrade, we may be required to post additional letters of credit.
shelf registration we have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the sec under which we have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities.

our debt balance at december 31, 2023, was $18.9 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion from the balance at december 31, 2022 of $16.6 billion. in 2023, we issued $2.7 billion principal amount of new debt to fund our acquisition of the remaining 50 percent working interest in surmont and completed refinancing transactions consisting of $1.1 billion in tender offers to repurchase existing debt with cash and a $1.1 billion new debt issuance to fund the repurchases. in 2022, we executed concurrent debt refinancing transactions, repurchased existing notes, and retired floating rate notes upon natural maturity, that in aggregate reduced our total debt by $3.3 billion while also lowering our annual cash interest expense and extending the weighted average maturity of our debt portfolio. see note 9 for information regarding debt and note 19 for information regarding non-cash consideration of the surmont transaction.
in february 2024, we announced our 2024 planned return of capital to shareholders of $9 billion through our three-tier return of capital framework. we plan to deliver a compelling, growing ordinary dividend, through-cycle share repurchases and a vroc payment. the vroc provides a flexible tool for meeting our commitment of returning greater than 30 percent of cash from operating activities during periods where commodity prices are meaningfully higher than our planning price range. our 2023 total capital returned was $11 billion.
consistent with our commitment to deliver value to shareholders, for the full year of 2023, we paid ordinary dividends of $2.11 per common share and vroc payments of $2.50 per common share. this was an increase over 2022 when we paid ordinary dividends of $1.89 and vroc payments of $2.60 per common share and an increase over 2021 when we paid an ordinary dividend of $1.75 per common share. in february 2024, we declared a first quarter ordinary dividend of $0.58 per common share and a vroc payment of $0.20 per common share, both payable march 1, 2024, to shareholders of record on february 19, 2024.
the ordinary dividend and vroc are subject to numerous considerations and are determined and approved each quarter by the board of directors. all vroc payments to date have been declared along with the ordinary dividend, but paid in the following quarter. however, beginning in the first quarter of 2024, we plan to pay any quarterly dividend and vroc payment concurrently and will announce such payments in the same quarter they will be paid.
in late 2016, we initiated our current share repurchase program. in october 2022, our board of directors approved an increase to our authorization from $25 billion to $45 billion of our common stock to support our plan for future share repurchases. share repurchases were $5.4 billion, $9.3 billion, and $3.6 billion in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. as of december 31, 2023, share repurchases since the inception of our current program totaled 383.4 million shares and $28.8 billion. repurchases are made at management's discretion, at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors.
for more information on factors considered when determining the levels of returns of capital see "item 1a-risk factors - our ability to execute our capital return program is subject to certain considerations."
as of december 31, 2023, in addition to the priorities described above, we have contractual obligations to purchase goods and services of approximately $29.7 billion. we expect to fulfill $7.4 billion of these obligations in 2024. these figures exclude purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator. purchase obligations of $9.8 billion are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and lng product terminals, to transport, process, treat and store commodities. purchase obligations of $17.8 billion are related to market-based contracts for commodity product purchases with third parties. the remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator.

conocophillips 2023 10-k capital resources and liquidity contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings, claims and liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business. we accrue for losses associated with legal claims when such losses are considered probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. see "critical accounting estimates" and note 11 for information on contingencies.
legal and tax matters we are subject to various lawsuits and claims, including but not limited to matters involving oil and gas royalty and severance tax payments, gas measurement and valuation methods, contract disputes, environmental damages, climate change, personal injury, and property damage. our primary exposures for such matters relate to alleged royalty and tax underpayments on certain federal, state and privately owned properties, claims of alleged environmental contamination and damages from historic operations, and climate change. we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.
our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience, and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. this process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required. see note 17.
environmental we are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. the most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the:
•u.s. federal clean air act, which governs air emissions;
•u.s. federal clean water act, which governs discharges to water bodies;
•european union regulation for registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals (reach);
•u.s. federal comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act (cercla or superfund), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur;
•u.s. federal resource conservation and recovery act (rcra), which governs the treatment, storage, and disposal of solid waste;
•u.s. federal oil pollution act of 1990 (opa90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the u.s.;
•u.s. federal emergency planning and community right-to-know act (epcra), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and response departments;
•u.s. federal safe drinking water act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells;
•u.s. department of the interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in u.s. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages; and
•european union trading directive resulting in european emissions trading scheme.
these laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. they also establish standards and impose obligations for the remediation of releases of hazardous substances and hazardous wastes. in most cases, these regulations require permits in association with new or modified operations. these permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time-consuming. in addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency's processing of the application. many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.
many states and foreign countries where we operate also have or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. while similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders.
conocophillips 2023 10-k capital resources and liquidity the ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards and water quality standards, continue to evolve. however, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the u.s. and in other countries in which we operate. notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the u.s. and canada.
an example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. a range of local, state, federal, or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations, with hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdictions. although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, potential new laws, regulations and permitting requirements from various state environmental agencies, and others could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments. we have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements. our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change.
we also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. such laws and regulations include cercla and rcra and their state equivalents. longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.
we occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under cercla or an equivalent state statute. on occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. these requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain waste attributable to our past operations. as of december 31, 2023, there were 15 sites around the u.s. in which we were identified as a potentially responsible party under cercla and comparable state laws.
for most superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the state agencies concerned. prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. in some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain epa or equivalent state agency approval. there are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all cercla sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.
expensed environmental costs were $791 million in 2023 and are expected to be approximately $937 million and $946 million in 2024 and 2025, respectively. capitalized environmental costs were $393 million in 2023 and are expected to be about $438 million and $450 million in 2024 and 2025, respectively.
accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis).
many of these liabilities result from cercla, rcra, and similar state or international laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct or once conducted operations or at sites where conocophillips-generated waste was disposed. the accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation but which are not currently the subject of cercla, rcra, or other agency enforcement activities. the laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites. if applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. in the future, we may incur significant costs under both cercla and rcra.
conocophillips 2023 10-k capital resources and liquidity remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.
at december 31, 2023, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $184 million, compared with $182 million at december 31, 2022, for remediation activities in the u.s. and canada. we expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years.
notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. however, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.
see item 1a. risk factors-we expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations and note 11 for information on environmental litigation.
climate change continuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on ghg emissions reduction. these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. laws in this field continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. examples of legislation and precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include:
•european emissions trading scheme (ets), the program through which many of the eu member states are implementing the kyoto protocol. our cost of compliance with the eu ets in 2023 was approximately $28 million (net share before-tax).
•u.k. emissions trading scheme, the program with which the u.k. has replaced the ets. our cost of compliance with the u.k. ets in 2023 was approximately $0.8 million (net share before-tax).
•the alberta technology innovation and emissions reduction (tier) regulation requires any existing facility with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide, or equivalent, per year to meet a facility benchmark intensity. the total cost of compliance related to this regulation in 2023 was approximately $3.5 million (net share before-tax).
•the u.s. government has announced on september 17, 2021 the global methane pledge, a global initiative to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030.
•carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions. our cost of compliance with norwegian carbon legislation in 2023 was approximately $35 million (net share before-tax). we also incur a carbon tax for emissions from fossil fuel combustion in our british columbia and alberta operations in canada, totaling approximately $8.2 million (net share before-tax).
•the agreement reached in paris in december 2015 at the 21st conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change, setting out a process for achieving global emissions reductions. the new administration has recommitted the united states to the paris agreement, and a significant number of u.s. state and local governments and major corporations headquartered in the u.s. have also announced related commitments. accordingly, the u.s. administration set a new target on april 22, 2021 of a 50 to 52 percent reduction in ghg emissions from 2005 levels in 2030.
•the u.s. epa announced the final new source performance standards (oooob) and emissions guidelines (ooooc) rulemaking on december 2, 2023. while industry is awaiting final publication of the rulemaking, we do anticipate that implementing this regulation across our u.s. portfolio will result in additional compliance costs. the proposed sub-part w regulations and the methane emission reduction program (merp), passed as part of the inflation reduction act of 2022 will potentially result in impacts to our business. the implementation of the merp fee, while applicable for 2024 emissions, has not yet been finalized by the epa.

•governments and financial regulators are developing new reporting rules requiring increased disclosure around a range of sustainability topics. in march 2022 the u.s. sec proposed rule changes that would require registrants to include certain climate-related disclosures in their registration statements and periodic reports; in january 2023 the eu finalized the corporate sustainability reporting directive that will require more detailed sustainability reporting; in june 2023 the international sustainability standards board issued inaugural sustainability reporting standards; and in october 2023 in california multiple bills were signed into law requiring climate-related disclosures for companies that conduct business in the state. the patchwork of reporting standards that is developing may require significant increases in disclosures, which may be costly to implement.
•the u.s. council on environmental quality is preparing to finalize revised regulations under the national environmental policy act (nepa phase 2), along with corresponding guidance on the consideration of ghg emissions and climate change, in early 2024. the new regulatory framework's emphasis on avoiding and minimizing climate impacts increases uncertainty associated with the federal environmental review and permitting process for oil and gas activities.
compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a ghg tax, emission trading scheme or ghg reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. the ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:
•whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted;
•the timing of the introduction of such legislation or regulation;
•the nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions) or regulation;
•the price placed on ghg emissions (either by the market or through a tax);
•the ghg reductions required;
•the price and availability of offsets;
•the amount and allocation of allowances;
•technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services;
•any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature); and
•whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.
see item 1a. risk factors-existing and future laws, regulations and internal initiatives relating to global climate changes, such as limitations on ghg emissions may impact or limit our business plans, result in significant expenditures, promote alternative uses of energy or reduce demand for our products and note 11 for information on climate change litigation.
company response to climate-related risks in 2020, we adopted a paris-aligned climate-related risk framework with an ambition to reduce our operational (scope 1 and 2) emissions to net-zero by 2050. the objective of our climate risk strategy is to manage climate-related risk, optimize opportunities and equip the company to respond to changes in key uncertainties, including government policies around the world, technologies for emissions reduction, alternative energy technologies and changes in consumer trends. the strategy sets out our choices around portfolio composition, emissions reductions, targets and incentives, emissions-related technology development, and our climate-related policy and finance sector engagement.
an important component of our climate risk strategy is the plan for the net-zero energy transition (the 'plan'). the plan outlines how we intend to play a valued role in the energy transition by executing on our triple mandate to: reliably and responsibly meet energy transition pathway demand, deliver competitive returns on and of capital and achieve our net-zero operational emissions ambition. the plan also outlines how we intend to apply our strategic capabilities and resources to meet the challenges posed by climate change in an economically viable, accountable and actionable way that balances the interests of our stakeholders.
conocophillips 2023 10-k capital resources and liquidity key elements of the plan include:
•maintaining strategic flexibility
◦building a resilient asset portfolio with a focus on low cost of supply and low ghg intensity to meet transition pathway energy demand.
◦committing to capital discipline through use of a fully burdened cost of supply, including cost of carbon, as the basis for capital allocation.
•reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions
◦setting targets for emissions over which we have ownership and control, with an ambition to become a net-zero company for scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050.
•addressing scope 3 emissions
◦advocating for a well-designed, economy-wide price on carbon and engaging in development of other policy and legislation to address end-use emissions.
◦working with our suppliers for alignment on ghg emissions reductions.
•contributing to an orderly transition
◦building an attractive lng portfolio.
◦evaluating potential investments in emerging energy transition and low-carbon technologies.
our plan does not include a scope 3 (end-use) emissions target. we recognize that end-use emissions must be reduced to meet global climate objectives. however, it is our view that supply-side constraints through scope 3 targets for north american and european upstream oil and gas producers would be counterproductive to climate goals. in the absence of policy measures that address global demand and with the shape and pace of technology and policy yet to be determined, setting and meeting scope 3 targets would require a shift of production to other global operators that have established less ambitious targets or no targets to reduce their own operational emissions or do not have any other ambitions or plans to manage climate-related risks, potentially eroding energy security and affordability as well as undercutting global climate change objectives. this is why we have consistently taken a prominent role in advocating for a well-designed, economy wide price on carbon and engaged in development of other policies or legislation that could address end-use emissions from high-carbon intensity energy use. we have also expanded policy advocacy beyond carbon pricing to include regulatory action, such as support for the direct regulation of methane.
in support of addressing our scope 1 and 2 emissions, in 2023, we made progress in several key areas.
•continued to refine our paris-aligned climate risk strategy.
•accelerated our ghg intensity reduction target to 50-60 percent by 2030 from a 2016 baseline for both gross operated and net equity emissions.
•achieved the gold standard pathway in the ogmp 2.0 initiative.
•implemented our new near-zero 2030 methane emissions intensity target of approximately 1.5 kilogram carbon dioxide equivalent per boe or of 0.15 percent of gas produced.
our emissions reduction efforts and net-zero ambition are supported by our multi-disciplinary low-carbon technologies organization. see item 1a. risk factors-our ability to successfully execute on our energy transition plans is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and may be costly to achieve.
new accounting standards for discussion of new accounting standards, see note 25.
conocophillips 2023 10-k critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. see note 1 for descriptions of our major accounting policies. certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent there is a reasonable likelihood materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. these critical accounting estimates are discussed with the audit and finance committee of the board of directors at least annually. we believe the following discussions of critical accounting estimates address all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.
oil and gas accounting accounting for oil and gas activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to the oil and gas industry. the acquisition of g&g seismic information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research and development costs. however, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been recognized.
property acquisition costs for individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. for insignificant individual leasehold acquisition costs, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves, including estimates of future expirations, and pools that leasehold information with others in similar geographic areas. for prospects in areas with limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. this judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. this judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively.
at year-end 2023, we held $4.4 billion of net capitalized unproved property costs which consisted primarily of individually significant and pooled leaseholds, mineral rights held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently being drilled, suspended exploratory wells and capitalized interest. of this amount, approximately $3.0 billion is concentrated in the delaware and midland basins, where we have an ongoing significant and active development program. outside of the delaware and midland basins, the remaining $1.4 billion is primarily concentrated in canada. management periodically assesses our unproved property for impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for commercialization.
exploratory costs for exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or "suspended," on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify development.
if exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. the accounting notion of "sufficient progress" is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the expectation future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable. often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or coventurer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits and believe they will be obtained. once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves.
at year-end 2023, total suspended well costs were $184 million, compared with $527 million at year-end 2022. for additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see note 6.
conocophillips 2023 10-k proved reserves engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. the reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons.
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of "proved" reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company's operations. there are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as "proved." our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. we have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates. see "supplementary data - oil and gas operations" for additional information.
proved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will reach the end of its economic life is based on historical 12-month first-of-month average prices and current costs. this date estimates when production will end and affects the amount of estimated reserves. therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise.
our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to pscs, reported under the "economic interest" method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices, recoverable operating expenses and capital costs. if costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. we would expect reserves from these contracts to decrease when product prices rise and increase when prices decline.
the estimation of proved reserves is also important to the income statement because the proved reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of the dd&a of the capitalized costs for that asset. at year-end 2023, the net book value of productive pp&e subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $62 billion and the dd&a recorded on these assets in 2023 was approximately $8.1 billion. the estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 3.8 billion boe at the end of 2022 and 3.7 billion boe at the end of 2023. if the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 10 percent across all calculations, before-tax dd&a in 2023 would have increased by an estimated $894 million.
business combination-valuation of oil and gas properties for business combinations, management applies the principles of acquisition accounting under fasb asc topic 805 - "business combinations" and allocates the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. estimating the fair values involves making various assumptions, of which the most significant assumptions relate to the fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and gas properties. for significant business combinations, management generally utilizes a discounted cash flow approach, based on market participant assumptions, and considers engaging third party valuation experts in preparing fair value estimates.
significant inputs incorporated within the valuation include future commodity price assumptions and production profiles of reserve estimates, the pace of drilling plans, future operating and development costs, inflation rates, and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital determined at the time of the acquisition. when estimating the fair value of unproved properties, additional risk-weighting adjustments are applied to probable and possible reserves.
the assumptions and inputs incorporated within the fair value estimates are subject to considerable management judgement and are based on industry, market, and economic conditions prevalent at the time of the acquisition. although we based these estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable, these estimates are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and actual results could differ. see note 3.
conocophillips 2023 10-k impairments long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. if there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, a recoverability test is performed using management's assumptions for prices, volumes and future development plans. if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows before income-taxes is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment in the periods in which the determination is made. individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets-generally on a field-by-field basis for e&p assets. because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible.
the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on estimated future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available evidence at the date of review. differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment in any period. see note 6 and note 7.
investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred. such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment's carrying amount. when such a condition is judgmentally determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment's carrying value and its estimated fair value. when determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee's financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment. since quoted market prices are usually not available, the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate. differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period. see the "aplng" section of note 4.
asset retirement obligations and environmental costs under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. our largest asset removal obligations involve plugging and abandonment of wells, removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in alaska. fair value is estimated using a present value approach, incorporating assumptions about estimated amounts and timing of settlements and impacts of the use of technologies. estimating future asset removal costs requires significant judgement. most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. the carrying value of our asset retirement obligation estimate is sensitive to inputs such as asset removal technologies and costs, regulatory and other compliance considerations, expenditure timing, and other inputs into valuation of the obligation, including discount and inflation rates, which are all subject to change between the time of initial recognition of the liability and future settlement of our obligation.
normally, changes in asset removal obligations are reflected in the income statement as increases or decreases to dd&a over the remaining life of the assets. however, for assets at or nearing the end of their operations, as well as previously sold assets for which we retained the asset removal obligation, an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings, because any increase in pp&e due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment, due to the low fair value of these properties.
in addition to asset removal obligations, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain environmental-related projects. these are primarily related to remediation activities required by canada and various states within the u.s. at exploration and production sites. future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. see note 8.
conocophillips 2023 10-k projected benefit obligations the actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. ultimately, we will be required to fund all vested benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. projected benefit obligations are particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption. a 100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligations by $600 million. benefit expense is sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. a 100 basis-point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $50 million, while a 100 basis-point decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $40 million. in determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans. we are also exposed to the possibility that lump sum retirement benefits taken from pension plans during the year could exceed the total of service and interest components of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of a portion of unrecognized net actuarial losses and gains. these benefit payments are based on decisions by plan participants and are therefore difficult to predict. in the event there is a significant reduction in the expected years of future service of present employees or the elimination of the accrual of defined benefits for some or all of their future services for a significant number of employees, we could recognize a curtailment gain or loss. see note 16.
contingencies a number of claims and lawsuits are made against the company arising in the ordinary course of business. management exercises judgment related to accounting and disclosure of these claims which includes losses, damages, and underpayments associated with environmental remediation, tax, contracts, and other legal disputes. as we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to amounts recognized and disclosed considering changes to the probability of additional losses and potential exposure. however, actual losses can and do vary from estimates for a variety of reasons including legal, arbitration, or other third-party decisions; settlement discussions; evaluation of scope of damages; interpretation of regulatory or contractual terms; expected timing of future actions; and proportion of liability shared with other responsible parties. estimated future costs related to contingencies are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes. for additional information on contingent liabilities, see the "contingencies" section within "capital resources and liquidity" and note 11.
income taxes we are subject to income taxation in numerous jurisdictions worldwide. we record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. we routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. in assessing the need for adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider all available positive and negative evidence. positive evidence includes reversals of temporary differences, forecasts of future taxable income, assessment of future business assumptions and applicable tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible. negative evidence includes losses in recent years as well as the forecasts of future net income (loss) in the realizable period. in making our assessment regarding valuation allowances, we weight the evidence based on objectivity. numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions and the assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our u.s. federal income taxes (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices). see note 17.
we regularly assess and, if required, establish accruals for uncertain tax positions that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where we operate. we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. these accruals for uncertain tax positions are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, court proceedings, changes in applicable tax laws, including tax case rulings and legislative guidance, or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. see note 17.

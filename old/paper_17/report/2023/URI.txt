item 1a.    risk factors our business, results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. in connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the sec. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. should any of these risks materialize, our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted, which in turn could affect the trading value of our securities.
industry and economic risks challenging economic conditions and the occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including public health crises and epidemics, have in the past adversely impacted, and may in the future adversely impact, us, our customers or our suppliers and in turn adversely affect our business, revenues and operating results.
our business has been and may in the future be adversely affected by economic conditions in the united states and globally. a worsening of economic conditions, in particular with respect to north american construction and industrial activities, could cause weakness in our end-markets and adversely affect our revenues and operating results. our general rental equipment and specialty equipment are used in connection with private non-residential construction and industrial activities. in the past, weakness in our end-markets has led to a decrease in the demand for our equipment and in the rates we realized. such decreases have adversely affected our operating results by causing our revenues to decline and, because certain of our costs are fixed, our operating margins to be reduced.
in addition, the following factors, among others, could adversely impact us, our customers or our suppliers and in turn adversely affect our revenues and operating results:
•a decrease in expected levels of infrastructure spending;
•a lack of availability of credit;
•excess fleet in the equipment rental industry;
•a decrease in the level of exploration, development, production activity and capital spending by oil and natural gas companies;
•an increase in costs, including the cost of construction materials, as a result of inflation or other factors;
•an increase in interest rates;
•instability in macroeconomic conditions;
•adverse weather conditions, which may temporarily affect a particular region;
•a prolonged shutdown of the u.s. government;
•public health crises and epidemics (or concerns over the possibility of such a health crisis or epidemic), such as covid-19;
•supply chain disruptions;
•terrorism or hostilities involving the united states, canada, europe, australia or new zealand;
•geopolitical conflicts, such as russia's invasion of ukraine and the conflict in the middle east, and the resultant sanctions and other measures imposed in response; or
•other unforeseen or catastrophic events.
these factors have in the past, and could in the future, among other things, cause weakness in our end-markets and impact customer demand for equipment rentals, reduce the availability and productivity of our employees, increase our costs, result in delayed payments from our customers and uncollectible accounts, impact previously announced strategic plans or impact our ability to access funds from financial institutions and capital markets on terms favorable to us, or at all.
trends in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect the level of exploration, development and production activity of certain of our customers and the demand for our services and products.
demand for our services and products is sensitive to the level of exploration, development and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies, including national oil companies, regional exploration and production providers, and related service providers. the level of exploration, development and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices, which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile.
prices for oil and natural gas are subject to potentially large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control. any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices will depress the immediate levels of exploration, development and production activity, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. even the perception of longer-term lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and natural gas companies and related service providers can similarly reduce or defer major expenditures by these companies and service providers given the long-term nature of many large-scale development projects. additionally, potential climate change regulation, including a potential carbon tax, could adversely affect the level of exploration, development and production activity of certain of our customers and the demand for our services and products. see "operational risks-climate change, climate change regulations and greenhouse effects may materially adversely impact our operations and markets."
our industry is highly competitive, and competitive pressures have in the past led, and could lead again in the future, to a decrease in our market share or in the prices that we can charge.
the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive. our competitors include small, independent businesses with one or two rental locations, regional competitors that operate in one or more states, national and global companies or divisions of national and global companies, and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers. we may in the future encounter increased competition from our existing competitors or from new competitors. competitive pressures have in the past adversely affected, and could again in the future adversely affect, our revenues and operating results by, among other things, decreasing our rental volumes, depressing the prices that we can charge or increasing our costs to retain employees.
increases in fuel costs or reduced supplies of fuel have in the past harmed, and could in the future again harm, our business.
we believe that one of our competitive advantages is the mobility of our fleet. accordingly, our business in the past has been, and in the future could be, adversely affected by limitations on fuel supplies or significant increases in fuel prices that result in higher costs to us for transporting equipment from one branch to another branch. although we have used, and may continue to use, futures contracts to hedge against fluctuations in fuel prices, a significant or protracted price fluctuation or disruption of fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. additionally, potential climate change regulation, including a potential carbon tax, could increase the overall cost of fuel to us and have a material adverse effect on us. see "operational risks-climate change, climate change regulations and greenhouse effects may materially adversely impact our operations and markets."
risks related to our indebtedness and liquidity our significant indebtedness exposes us to various risks.
at december 31, 2023, our total indebtedness was $11.5 billion. our significant indebtedness could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition in a number of ways by, among other things:
•increasing our vulnerability to, and limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;
•making it more difficult to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during periods of adverse economic, financial market or industry conditions;
•requiring us to devote a substantial amount of our cash flow to debt service, reducing the funds available for other purposes, including funding working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, execution of our growth strategy and other general corporate purposes, or otherwise constraining our financial flexibility;
•restricting our ability to move operating cash flows to holdings. urna's payment capacity is restricted under the covenants in our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility ("abl facility"), our senior secured term loan credit facility ("term loan facility") and the indentures governing urna's outstanding senior notes;
•affecting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, acquisitions or other purposes, particularly since substantially all of our assets are subject to security interests relating to existing indebtedness;
•decreasing our profitability or cash flow;
•causing us to be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions;
•causing us to be disadvantaged compared to competitors with less debt and lower debt service requirements;
•resulting in a downgrade in our credit rating or the credit ratings of any of the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, which could increase the cost of further borrowings;
•requiring our debt to become due and payable upon a change in control; and
•limiting our ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.
a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates. as a result, increases in market interest rates increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations. at december 31, 2023, we had $3.6 billion of indebtedness that bore interest at variable rates. as of december 31, 2023, our variable rate indebtedness represented 31 percent of our total indebtedness. see item 7a-quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information related to interest rate risk.
to service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.
we depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments. to a significant extent, our ability to do so is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay our indebtedness when it becomes due and to meet our other cash needs. if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations, we will have to adopt an alternative strategy that may include:
•reducing or delaying capital expenditures;
•limiting our growth;
•seeking additional capital;
•selling assets; or
•restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness.
even if we adopt an alternative strategy, the strategy may not be successful and we may continue to be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations.
we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. our inability to refinance our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ongoing results of operations.
our ability to refinance indebtedness will depend in part on our operating and financial performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. in addition, prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing could increase our interest expense. a refinancing of our indebtedness could also require us to comply with more onerous covenants and further restrict our business operations. our inability to refinance our indebtedness or to do so upon attractive terms could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and make us vulnerable to adverse industry and general economic conditions.
we may be able to incur substantially more debt and take other actions that could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness.
despite our indebtedness level, we may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness in the future and such indebtedness may be secured indebtedness. the indentures and other agreements governing our current indebtedness permit us to recapitalize our debt or take a number of other actions, any of which could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due and further exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness. if new debt is added to our or any of our existing and future subsidiaries' current debt, the related risks that we now face could intensify and we may not be able to meet all of our debt obligations.
if we are unable to satisfy the financial covenant or comply with other covenants in certain of our debt agreements, our lenders could elect to terminate the agreements and require us to repay the outstanding borrowings, or we could face other substantial costs.
we rely on our abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility to provide liquidity for our business, including to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, operating expenses and other liquidity needs. the only financial covenant that currently exists under the abl facility is the fixed charge coverage ratio. subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility, the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the abl facility will only apply in the future if specified availability under the abl facility falls below 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility. when certain conditions are met, cash and cash equivalents and borrowing base collateral in excess of the abl facility size may be included when calculating specified availability under the abl facility. as of december 31, 2023, specified availability under the abl facility exceeded the required threshold and, as a result, this financial covenant was inapplicable. under our accounts receivable securitization facility, we are required, among other things, to maintain certain financial tests relating to: (i) the default ratio, (ii) the delinquency ratio, (iii) the dilution ratio and (iv) days sales outstanding. the accounts receivable securitization facility also requires us to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio under the abl facility, to the extent the ratio is applicable under the abl facility. if we are unable to satisfy the financial covenant under the abl facility or the financial tests under the accounts receivable securitization facility or comply with any of the other relevant covenants under the applicable agreement, the lenders could elect to terminate the abl facility and/or the accounts receivable securitization facility and require us to repay outstanding borrowings. in such event, unless we are able to refinance the indebtedness coming due and replace the abl facility and/or the accounts receivable securitization facility, we would likely not have sufficient liquidity for our business needs and would be forced to adopt an alternative strategy. even if we adopt an alternative strategy, the strategy may not be successful and we may not have sufficient liquidity to service our debt and fund our operations. future debt arrangements we enter into may contain similar financial covenant provisions.
restrictive covenants in certain of the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility.
in addition to the financial covenant and other financial tests, various other covenants in the abl facility, term loan facility, accounts receivable securitization facility and the other agreements governing our debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries. such covenants include, among other things, limitations on: (i) liens; (ii) indebtedness; (iii) mergers, consolidations and acquisitions; (iv) sales, transfers and other dispositions of assets; (v) loans and other investments; (vi) dividends and other distributions, stock repurchases and redemptions and other restricted payments; (vii) dividends, other payments and other matters affecting subsidiaries; (viii) transactions with affiliates; and (ix) issuances of preferred stock of certain subsidiaries. future debt agreements we enter into may include similar provisions.
these restrictions may cause us to suspend or cease the payment of dividends. these restrictions may also make more difficult or discourage a takeover of us, whether favored or opposed by our management and/or our board of directors.
our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and any material deviations from our forecasts could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing, or to reduce expenditures. we cannot guarantee that such waivers, amendments or alternative financing could be obtained or, if obtained, would be on terms acceptable to us.
a breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in these agreements would result in an event of default. such a default could allow our debt holders to accelerate repayment of the related debt, as well as any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, and/or to declare all borrowings outstanding under these agreements to be due and payable. if our debt is accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay such debt.
the amount of borrowings permitted under our abl facility may fluctuate significantly, which may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial position.
the amount of borrowings permitted at any time under our abl facility is limited to a periodic borrowing base valuation of the collateral thereunder. as a result, our access to credit under our abl facility is potentially subject to significant fluctuations depending on the value of the borrowing base of eligible assets as of any measurement date, as well as certain discretionary rights of the agent in respect of the calculation of such borrowing base value. the inability to borrow under our abl facility, or limitations on the amounts we can borrow under our abl facility, may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial position.
we rely on available borrowings under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility for cash to operate our business, which subjects us to market and counterparty risk, some of which is beyond our control.
in addition to cash we generate from our business, our principal existing sources of cash are borrowings available under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility. if our access to such financing was unavailable or reduced, or if such financing were to become significantly more expensive for any reason, we may not be able to fund daily operations, which would cause material harm to our business or could affect our ability to operate our business as a going concern. in addition, if certain of our lenders experience difficulties that render them unable to fund future draws on the facilities, we may not be able to access all or a portion of these funds, which could have similar adverse consequences.
if we are unable to obtain additional capital as required, we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business.
if the cash that we generate from our business, together with cash that we may borrow under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility, is not sufficient to fund our capital requirements, we will require additional debt and/or equity financing. however, we may not succeed in obtaining the requisite additional financing or such financing may include terms that are not satisfactory to us. we may not be able to obtain additional debt financing as a result of prevailing interest rates or other factors, including the presence of covenants or other restrictions under the abl facility and/or other agreements governing our debt. in the event we seek to obtain equity financing, our stockholders may experience dilution as a result of the issuance of additional equity securities. this dilution may be significant depending upon the amount of equity securities that we issue and the prices at which we issue such securities. if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future, we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business, including those relating to purchasing equipment, growth plans and refinancing existing indebtedness.
risks related to our strategic transactions and investments our growth strategies may be unsuccessful if we are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets.
we have historically achieved a significant portion of our growth through acquisitions and we will continue to consider potential acquisitions on a selective basis. from time to time we have also approached, or have been approached by, other public companies or large privately-held companies to explore consolidation opportunities. there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities in the future or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us.
acquisitions entail certain risks, including:
•unrecorded liabilities of acquired companies and unidentified issues with acquired companies or acquired assets that we fail to discover during our due diligence investigations or that are not subject to indemnification or reimbursement by the seller;
•greater than expected expenses, such as the need to obtain additional debt or equity financing for any transaction;
•unfavorable accounting treatment and unexpected increases in taxes;
•adverse effects on our ability to maintain relationships with customers, employees and suppliers;
•inherent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited experience;
•difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of an acquired company, or acquired assets, within our existing operations, including the consolidation of corporate and administrative functions;
•difficulty in integrating marketing, information technology and other systems;
•difficulty in conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures;
•difficulty in identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets;
•loss of key employees of the acquired company;
•operating inefficiencies that have a negative impact on profitability;
•impairment of goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets;
•failure to achieve anticipated synergies or receiving an inadequate return of capital; and
•strains on management and other personnel time and resources to evaluate, negotiate and integrate acquisitions.
our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with any past or future acquisition could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions over the timeframe we expect, or at all, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities or harm our existing operations or our business generally. in addition, if we are unable to successfully integrate our acquisitions with our existing business, we may not obtain the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create, which may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, our ability to introduce new services and products and the market price of our stock.
we would expect to pay for any future acquisitions using cash, capital stock, net proceeds from the issuance of notes, borrowings under our credit facilities and/or assumption of indebtedness. to the extent that our existing sources of cash are not sufficient, we would expect to need additional debt or equity financing, which involves its own risks, such as the dilutive effect on shares held by our stockholders if we financed acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities, or the risks associated with debt incurrence.
if we determine that our goodwill has become impaired, we may incur impairment charges, which would negatively impact our operating results.
at december 31, 2023, we had $5.9 billion of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet. goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. we assess potential impairment of our goodwill at least annually. impairment may result from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets, negative industry or economic trends and/or significant underperformance relative to historic or projected operating results. for a discussion of our goodwill impairment testing, see "critical accounting policies-evaluation of goodwill impairment" in part ii, item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
risks related to our securities our operating results may fluctuate, which could affect the trading value of our securities.
our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term due to a number of factors, which could adversely affect the trading value of our securities. these factors, in addition to general economic conditions and the factors discussed above under "cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements", include, but are not limited to:
•the seasonal rental patterns of our customers, with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter;
•changes in the size of our rental fleet and/or in the rate at which we sell our used equipment;
•excess fleet in the equipment rental industry;
•changes in private non-residential construction spending or government funding for infrastructure and other construction projects;
•changes in demand for, or utilization of, our equipment or in the prices we charge due to changes in economic conditions, including rising inflation, competition or other factors;
•changes in customer, fleet, geographic and segment mix;
•commodity price pressures and the resultant increase in the cost of fuel and steel to our equipment suppliers, which can result in increased equipment costs for us;
•cost increases as a result of inflation;
•other cost fluctuations, such as costs for employee-related compensation and healthcare benefits;
•labor shortages and/or disputes, work stoppages or other labor difficulties;
•potential enactment of new legislation affecting our operations or labor relations;
•supply chain or other disruptions that impact our ability to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business from our key suppliers on acceptable terms or at all;
•completion of acquisitions, divestitures or recapitalizations;
•increases in interest rates and related increases in our interest expense and our debt service obligations;
•the possible need, from time to time, to record goodwill impairment charges or other write-offs or charges due to a variety of occurrences, such as the adoption of new accounting standards, the impairment of assets, rental location divestitures, dislocation in the equity and/or credit markets, consolidations or closings, restructurings, the refinancing of existing indebtedness or the buy-out of equipment leases; and
•currency risks and other risks associated with international operations.
our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future.
our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future for a number of reasons, including:
•fluctuations in the results of our operations and general conditions in the economy, our market, and the markets served by our customers;
•announcements of developments related to our business;
•market perceptions of any proposed merger or acquisition and the likelihood of our involvement in other merger and acquisition activity;
•variations in our revenues, gross margins, earnings or other financial results from investors' expectations;
•departure of key personnel;
•purchases or sales of large blocks of our stock by institutional investors or transactions by insiders;
•investor perceptions of the equipment rental industry in general and our company in particular;
•fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas;
•expectations regarding our share repurchase programs;
•changes in our dividend policy; and
•the operating and stock performance of comparable companies or related industries.
in addition, prices in the stock market have been volatile over the past few years. in certain cases, the fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. as a result, the price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future without regard to our operating performance.
we cannot guarantee that we will repurchase our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase programs or that our share repurchase programs will enhance long-term stockholder value. share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and could diminish our cash reserves.
in october 2022, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program. under the program, we are authorized to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed $1.25 billion, excluding fees, commissions and other ancillary expenses. we have completed $1.0 billion of repurchases under the program as of december 31, 2023, and expect to complete the program in the first quarter of 2024. on january 24, 2024, our board of directors authorized a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program. we plan to begin repurchases under the new program following the planned completion of the existing $1.25 billion share repurchase program in the first quarter of 2024, and intend to purchase $1.25 billion under the new program in 2024 and then complete the program by the end of the first quarter of 2025.
although the board of directors has authorized the share repurchase programs, the share repurchase programs do not obligate the company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. the timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, the trading price of the company's common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities. in august 2022, congress passed the inflation reduction act, which imposes a one percent tax on stock repurchases, subject to certain adjustments, after december 31, 2022 by publicly traded u.s. companies, including us, which may also impact our decision to engage in share repurchases. also, our ability to repurchase shares of stock may be limited by restrictive covenants in our debt agreements. the repurchase programs may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. in addition, repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase programs could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. the existence of a share repurchase program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. additionally, our share repurchase programs could diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth, to continue to pay a dividend and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions. there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock. although our share repurchase programs are intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that they will do so and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program's effectiveness.
our charter provisions, as well as other factors, may affect the likelihood of a takeover or change of control of the company.
we have in place certain charter provisions that may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the company that are not approved by our board, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices. we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which, under certain circumstances, restricts the ability of a publicly held delaware corporation to engage in a business combination, such as a merger or sale of assets, with any stockholder that, together with affiliates, owns 15 percent or more of the corporation's outstanding voting stock, which similarly could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of a change of control transaction. in addition, under each of the abl facility and the term loan facility, a change of control (as defined in the applicable credit agreement) constitutes an event of default, entitling our lenders to terminate the abl facility or the term loan facility, as applicable, and require us to repay outstanding borrowings. a change of control (as defined in the applicable agreement) is also a termination event under our accounts receivable securitization facility and under certain circumstances would require us to offer to repurchase our outstanding senior notes. as a result, the provisions of the agreements governing our debt also may affect the likelihood of a takeover or other change of control.
we cannot make any guarantees with respect to payment of dividends on our common stock.
the board of directors will regularly evaluate our capital allocation strategy and dividend policy, and any future determination to continue to pay dividends, and the amount of such dividends, will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and contractual restrictions, including the requirements of the agreements governing our indebtedness. no assurance can be given that cash dividends will continue to be declared and paid, and, if declared and paid, the amount of such dividends.
operational risks if we are unable to collect on contracts with customers, our operating results would be adversely affected.
one of the reasons some of our customers find it more attractive to rent equipment than own that equipment is the need to deploy their capital elsewhere. however, some of our customers may have liquidity issues and ultimately may not be able to fulfill the terms of their rental agreements with us. if we are unable to manage credit risk issues adequately, or if a large number of customers have financial difficulties at the same time, our credit losses could increase above historical levels and our operating results would be adversely affected. further, a worsening of economic conditions would be expected to result in increased delinquencies and credit losses, which could exacerbate adverse impacts on our business and operating results.
turnover of members of our management and our ability to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our ability to efficiently manage our business and execute our strategy.
our success is dependent, in part, on the experience and skills of our management team, and competition in our industry and the business world for top management talent is generally significant. although we believe we generally have competitive pay packages, we can provide no assurance that our efforts to attract and retain our senior management staff will be successful. moreover, in the past, we have experienced volatility in our stock price, and we may experience such volatility again in the future, which may make it more difficult and expensive to recruit and retain employees, particularly senior management, through grants of stock or stock options. this, in turn, could place greater pressure on the company to increase the cash component of its compensation packages, which may adversely affect our operating results. if we are unable to fill and keep filled all of our senior management positions, or if we lose the services of any key member of our senior management team and are unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely fashion, we may be challenged to effectively manage our business and execute our strategy.
in addition, we must continue to identify, hire, train and retain key personnel who maintain relationships with our customers and who provide technical skills required for our company's growth. there is a shortage of qualified personnel in these fields, and we compete with other companies for the limited pool of talent. the failure to recruit and retain necessary key personnel could cause disruption, harm our business and hamper our ability to grow our company.
our operational and cost reduction strategies may not generate the improvements and efficiencies we expect.
we have been pursuing a general strategy of optimizing our field operations in order to address potential labor shortages, improve servicing capabilities, improve sales force effectiveness, and focus our sales force's efforts on increasing revenues from our national account and other large customers. we also continue to pursue strategies to improve productivity. the extent to which these efforts and strategies will achieve our desired efficiencies and goals in 2024 and beyond is uncertain, as their success depends on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. even if we carry out these strategies in the manner we currently expect, we may not achieve the efficiencies or savings we anticipate, or on the timetable we anticipate, and there may be unforeseen productivity, revenue or other consequences resulting from our strategies that may adversely affect us. therefore, there can be no guarantee that our strategies will prove effective in achieving the desired level of profitability, margins or returns to stockholders.
we are dependent on our relationships with key suppliers to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business on acceptable terms.
our centralization of equipment and non-equipment purchases has resulted in us depending on, and being exposed to, the credit risk of a group of key suppliers. while we make every effort to evaluate our counterparties prior to entering into long-term and other significant procurement contracts, we cannot predict the impact on our suppliers of the economic environment and other developments in their respective businesses. insolvency, financial difficulties or other factors may result in our suppliers not being able to fulfill the terms of their agreements with us. further, such factors may render suppliers unwilling to extend contracts that provide favorable terms to us, or may force them to seek to renegotiate existing contracts with us. the termination of our relationship with any of our key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in the unlikely event that we were unable to obtain adequate equipment or supplies from other sources in a timely manner, at a reasonable cost or at all.
disruptions in our supply chain could result in adverse effects on our results of operations and financial performance.
supply chain disruptions could impact our ability to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business from our key suppliers on acceptable terms or at all. to date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experience more severe supply chain disruptions in the future or supplier inability to manufacture or deliver equipment or parts. any suspension or delay in our suppliers' ability to provide us adequate equipment or supplies, or in our ability to procure equipment or supplies from other sources in a timely manner or at all, could impair our ability to meet customer demand and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
if our rental fleet ages, our operating costs may increase, we may be unable to pass along such costs, and our earnings may decrease. the costs of new equipment we use in our fleet have increased, and may continue to increase, requiring us to spend more for replacement equipment or preventing us from procuring equipment on a timely basis.
if our rental equipment ages, the costs of maintaining such equipment, if not replaced within a certain period of time, will likely increase. the costs of maintenance may materially increase in the future and could lead to material adverse effects on our results of operations.
the cost of new equipment for use in our rental fleet has increased, and could continue to increase in the future, due to increased material costs for our suppliers (including tariffs on raw materials) or other factors beyond our control. such increases could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods. furthermore, changes in customer demand could cause certain of our existing equipment to become obsolete and require us to purchase new equipment at increased costs.
disruptions in our information technology systems or a compromise of security with respect to our systems could adversely affect our operating results by limiting our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations, adjust to changing market conditions, implement strategic initiatives or support our online ordering system.
we rely on our information technology systems to be able to monitor and control our operations, adjust to changing market conditions, implement strategic initiatives and support our online ordering system. any disruptions in these systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected have in the past adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, our ability to access and use certain applications and could, depending on the nature and magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results by limiting our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations, adjust to changing market conditions, implement strategic initiatives and service online orders. although such disruptions and failures have not been material to date, we cannot guarantee that they will not be material in the future. in addition, the security measures we employ to protect our systems have in the past not detected or prevented, and may in the future not detect or prevent, all attempts to hack our systems, denial-of-service attacks, viruses, malicious software (malware), employee error or malfeasance, phishing attacks, security breaches, disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware or integrating systems of acquired businesses or assets or other attacks and similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information stored in or transmitted by the sites, networks and systems that we otherwise maintain, which include cloud-based networks and data center storage.
we have, from time to time, experienced threats to and breaches of our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks. we are continuously developing and enhancing our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. this continued development and enhancement requires us to expend significant resources. however, we may not anticipate or combat all types of future attacks until after they have been launched. if any of these breaches of security occur or are anticipated in the future, we could be required to expend additional capital and other resources, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees and engage third-party experts and consultants. our response to attacks, and our investments in our technology and our controls, processes and practices, may not be sufficient to shield us from significant losses or liability. further, given the increasing sophistication of bad actors and complexity of the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or disable systems, a breach or attack could potentially persist for an extended period of time before being detected. as a result, we may not be able to anticipate the attack or respond adequately or timely, and the extent of a particular incident, and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the incident, may not be immediately clear. it could take a significant amount of time before an investigation can be completed and full, reliable information about the incident becomes known. during an investigation, it is possible we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how to remediate it, which could further adversely impact us, and new regulations could result in us being required to disclose information about a material cybersecurity incident before it has been mitigated or resolved, or even fully investigated. we also face cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and hybrid work arrangements, which could strain our technology resources or create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities.
in addition, because our systems sometimes contain information about individuals and businesses, our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold, whether as a result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others, have led, and could in the future lead, to disruptions in our online ordering system or other data systems, and could lead to unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information or corruption of data. our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold could also violate applicable privacy, data security and other laws and subject us to lawsuits, fines and other means of regulatory enforcement. regulators have been imposing new data privacy and security requirements, including new and greater monetary fines for privacy violations. for example, the european union's ("eu") general data protection regulation (regulation (eu) 2016/679) (the "gdpr") has stringent data protection requirements and provides for significant penalties. non-compliance with the gdpr could lead to lower revenues, increased costs (including fines, which could be significant) and other material adverse effects on our results of operations. in addition, countries such as the united kingdom (the "uk") have implemented the gdpr through their own legislation. other countries, including the u.s., have proposed or adopted their own data protection legislation. these laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations and increasing enforcement, and we have incurred costs to monitor compliance and have altered our practices, and may have to do so again in the future. moreover, certain new and existing data privacy laws and regulations could diverge and conflict with each other in certain respects, which makes compliance increasingly difficult. complying with new regulatory requirements has in the past required, and could in the future require, us to incur substantial expenses or require us to change our business practices, either of which could harm our business. as regulators have become increasingly focused on information security, data collection and use and privacy, we may be required to devote significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security controls and to identify and remediate vulnerabilities, which could adversely impact our results of operations and profitability.
any compromise or breach of our systems could result in adverse publicity, harm our reputation, lead to claims against us and affect our relationships with our customers and employees, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. certain of our software applications are also utilized by third parties who provide outsourced administrative functions, which may increase the risk of a cybersecurity incident. although we maintain insurance coverage for various cybersecurity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.
climate change, climate change regulations and greenhouse effects may materially adversely impact our operations and markets.
climate change and its association with greenhouse gas emissions is receiving increased attention from the scientific and political communities. the u.s. federal government, certain u.s. states and certain other countries and regions have adopted or are considering legislation or regulation imposing overall caps or taxes on greenhouse gas emissions from certain sectors or facility categories. such new laws or regulations, or stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, could increase the costs of operating our businesses, reduce the demand for our products and services and impact the prices we charge our customers, any or all of which could adversely affect our results of operations. failure to comply with any legislation or regulation could potentially result in substantial fines, criminal sanctions or operational changes. moreover, even without such legislation or regulation, the perspectives of our customers, stockholders, employees and other stakeholders regarding climate change are continuing to evolve, and increased awareness of, or any adverse publicity regarding, the effects of greenhouse gases could harm our reputation or reduce customer demand for our products and services.
additionally, as severe weather events become increasingly common, our or our customers' operations may be disrupted, which could result in increased operational costs or reduced demand for our products and services, and climate change may also reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance for weather-related events. in addition, climate change may impact the global economy, including as a result of disruptions to supply chains. while we have invested in the administration of programs and physical loss prevention improvements to mitigate the risk of natural disasters causing disruption to our ability to serve our customers and communities in times of need, extended periods of disruptions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. we anticipate that climate change-related risks will increase over time.
we are subject to risks related to our ability to meet our environmental and social goals, including our greenhouse gas intensity reduction goal.
although we have announced environmental and social goals, including our greenhouse gas intensity reduction goal, our efforts to provide more low- and zero-emissions equipment to our customers and our efforts to provide customers with tools to monitor and manage their environmental impacts, there can be no assurance that our shareholders and other stakeholders will agree with our goals and strategies or be satisfied with our efforts to attain such goals. moreover, any perception, whether or not valid, that we have failed to act responsibly with respect to such matters, failed to achieve our goals or failed to effectively respond to new or additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change, could adversely affect our business and reputation. execution of our environmental and social goals is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, including, but not limited to, our ability to achieve our goals within the expected timeframes and the currently projected cost ranges; the availability and cost of renewable energy; the availability and cost of low- and zero-emissions equipment and vehicles for our rental fleet; the availability and cost of low- and zero-emissions vehicles for our sales, service and delivery non-rental fleet; compliance with global and regional regulations, taxes, charges, mandates or requirements relating to greenhouse gas emissions, carbon costs or climate-related goals; adapting products to customer preferences and customer acceptance of low- and zero-emissions equipment; the accuracy of the assumptions used to estimate customers' emissions in our emissions tracking tool in total control®; and the actions of competitors and competitive pressures. as a result, there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully achieve our environmental and social goals, which could damage our reputation and customer and other stakeholder relationships and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
our growing specialty reportable segment, as well as our tools and onsite services offerings, presents new and expanded risks, which may increase as we engage in new activities and provide new services.
our specialty reportable segment has accounted for an increasing portion of our business and revenues in recent years. specialty segment revenues constituted 25.4 percent of our revenues for the year ended december 31, 2023, as compared to 7.3 percent of our revenues for the year ended december 31, 2013. in connection with the expansion of the specialty segment, we have expanded the scope of services we provide to clients; for example, we advise clients on the compatibility of our equipment with various applications, collaborate and consult with clients on certain aspects of civil construction projects, design and erect scaffolding, and design electrical pump systems. to the extent we engage in those and other similar activities, we have faced, and will continue to face, increased legal, reputational and operational risks. these new or expanded business activities also expose us to new or different types of risks, including risks related to spills, unauthorized use of equipment, system failure, ineffectiveness of the solutions and products we provide, and hazardous material issues and interference. we have been, and may in the future be, subject to various claims in connection with these activities and services, and the associated risks may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude may remain unknown for substantial periods of time, particularly as we engage in new business activities where we do not have historical experience. although we have insurance to protect ourselves against claims in connection with these activities, we cannot guarantee that any insurance coverage will be sufficient or that we will continue to be able to obtain such coverage at reasonable rates or at all. see also "we are exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business, and our insurance may not fully cover them."
our rental fleet is subject to residual value risk upon disposition, and may not sell at the prices or in the quantities we expect.
the market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold. the market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors, including:
•the market price for new equipment of a like kind;
•wear and tear on the equipment relative to its age and the performance of preventive maintenance;
•the time of year that it is sold;
•the supply of used equipment on the market;
•the existence and capacities of different sales outlets;
•the age of the equipment at the time it is sold;
•worldwide and domestic demand for used equipment; and
•general economic conditions.
we include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold. changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense, as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of equipment. sales of our used rental equipment at prices that fall significantly below our projections and/or in lesser quantities than we anticipate will have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.
we have operations outside the united states, in canada, europe, australia and new zealand. as a result, we may incur losses from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and have higher costs than we otherwise would have due to the need to comply with foreign laws.
our operations in canada, europe, australia and new zealand are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations. these include (i) the need to convert currencies, which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates and (ii) the need to comply with foreign laws and regulations, as well as u.s. laws and regulations, applicable to our operations in foreign jurisdictions. changes in such laws or regulations, or any material failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, can increase our costs, affect our reputation, limit our business, drain management time and attention and otherwise impact our operations in adverse ways. in addition, laws or regulations or the interpretations thereof can conflict among jurisdictions, and compliance in one jurisdiction could result in legal or reputational risks in another jurisdiction. see item 7a-quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information related to currency exchange risk.
we have a holding company structure and depend in part on distributions from our subsidiaries to pay amounts due on our indebtedness. certain provisions of law or contractual restrictions could limit distributions from our subsidiaries.
we derive substantially all of our operating income from, and hold substantially all of our assets through, our subsidiaries. the effect of this structure is that we depend in part on the earnings of our subsidiaries, and the payment or other distribution to us of these earnings, to meet our obligations under our outstanding debt. provisions of law, such as those requiring that dividends be paid only from surplus, could limit the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments or other distributions to us. furthermore, these subsidiaries could in certain circumstances agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions. distributions from our subsidiaries may also be limited by restrictive covenants in our debt agreements.
legal and regulatory risks we are exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business, and our insurance may not fully cover them.
in the ordinary course of our business operations, we are exposed to a variety of potential claims. these claims include those relating to personal injuries or property damage arising from: (i) the use and/or operation of our rented or sold equipment, (ii) motor vehicle accidents involving our vehicles and our employees and (iii) employment-related claims. currently, we carry a broad range of insurance for the protection of our assets and operations. however, such insurance may not fully cover these claims for a number of reasons, including:
•our insurance policies, reflecting a program structure that we believe reflects market conditions for companies of our size, are often subject to significant deductibles or self-insured retentions;
•our director and officer liability insurance policy has no deductible for individual non-indemnifiable loss, but is subject to a deductible for company reimbursement coverage;
•we do not currently maintain company-wide stand-alone first party coverage for environmental liability (other than legally required and third party site pollution coverage), since we believe the cost for such coverage is high relative to the benefit it provides; and
•certain types of claims, such as claims for punitive damages or for damages arising from intentional misconduct, which are often alleged in third party lawsuits, might not be covered by our insurance.
we establish and evaluate our loss reserves on a semi-annual basis to address casualty claims, or portions thereof, not covered by our insurance policies. to the extent that we are subject to a higher frequency of claims, are subject to more serious claims or insurance coverage is not available, we could have to significantly increase our reserves, and our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. it is also possible that some or all of the insurance that is currently available to us will not be available in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all.
we are subject to numerous environmental and safety regulations. if we are required to incur compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated, our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.
our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters. these laws regulate issues such as wastewater, storm water, solid and hazardous waste, storage of hazardous materials, and air quality. under these laws, we may be liable for, among other things: (i) the costs of investigating and remediating any contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we send hazardous waste for disposal or treatment, regardless of fault; and (ii) fines and penalties for non-compliance. while our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks, we use hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment, dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing, and store and dispense petroleum products from above-ground storage tanks located at certain of our locations.
we cannot be certain as to the potential financial impact on our business if new adverse environmental conditions are discovered. if we are required to incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated, our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected, depending on the magnitude of such costs. in addition, as environmental and safety regulations have tended to become stricter, we could incur additional costs in complying with requirements that are promulgated in the future. these include climate change regulation, which could materially affect our operating results through increased compliance costs.
we have operations throughout the united states, which exposes us to multiple state and local regulations, in addition to federal law and requirements as a government contractor. changes in applicable law, regulations or requirements, or our material failure to comply with any of them, can increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business.
our 1,357 branch locations in the united states are located in 49 states, and puerto rico, which exposes us to a host of different state and local regulations, in addition to federal law and regulatory and contractual requirements we face as a government contractor. these laws and requirements address multiple aspects of our operations, such as employee safety, consumer rights, privacy, employee benefits and more. in addition, there are often different and potentially conflicting requirements in different jurisdictions. changes in these requirements, or any material failure by our branches to comply with them, can increase our costs, affect our reputation, limit our business, drain management time and attention and otherwise impact our operations in adverse ways.
our collective bargaining agreements and our relationship with our union-represented employees could disrupt our ability to serve our customers, lead to higher labor costs or the payment of withdrawal liability.
we currently have approximately 1,800 employees who are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 24,500 employees who are not represented by unions. various unions occasionally seek to organize certain of our nonunion employees. union organizing efforts or collective bargaining negotiations could potentially lead to work stoppages and/or slowdowns or strikes by certain of our employees, which could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers. further, settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can have unknown effects on our labor costs, productivity and flexibility.
under the collective bargaining agreements that we have signed, we are obligated to contribute to several multiemployer pension plans on behalf of some of our unionized employees. a multiemployer pension plan is a plan that covers the union-represented workers of various unrelated companies. under the employee retirement income security act, a contributing employer to an underfunded multiemployer plan is liable, generally upon withdrawal from a plan, for its proportionate share of the plan's unfunded vested liability. we currently have no intention of withdrawing from any multiemployer plan. however, there can be no assurance that we will not withdraw from one or more multiemployer plans in the future and be required to pay material amounts of withdrawal liability if one or more of those plans are underfunded at the time of withdrawal.
item 7.     management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (dollars in millions, except per share data and unless otherwise indicated)
we have omitted discussions comparing 2022 and 2021 results, as such disclosures were included in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022.
global economic conditions our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. in 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient rental capacity for our customers. to date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experience more severe supply chain disruptions in the future. interest rates on our debt instruments have increased recently. for example, in november 2022, urna issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes at a 6 percent interest rate, while urna's immediately prior issuance in august 2021 of $750 aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes was at a 3 3⁄4 percent interest rate. additionally, the weighted average interest rates on our variable debt instruments were 6.3 percent in 2023 and 3.3 percent in 2022. we have experienced and are continuing to experience inflationary pressures. a portion of inflationary cost increases is passed on to customers. the most significant cost increases that are passed on to customers are for fuel and delivery, and there are other costs for which the pass through to customers is less direct, such as repairs and maintenance, and labor. the impact of inflation and increased interest rates may continue to be significant in the future.
we also continue to monitor any developments relating to the coronavirus ("covid-19"). the health and safety of our employees and customers has been, and remains, our top priority, and we also implemented a detailed covid-19 response plan, which we believe helped mitigate the impact of covid-19 on our results. the covid-19 impact on our business was most pronounced in 2020, and activity across our end-markets began to recover in 2021. our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2020 and our quarterly reports on form 10-q filed in 2021 and 2020 include detailed disclosures addressing the covid-19 impact on our business.
we continue to assess the economic environment in which we operate and any developments relating to covid-19, and take appropriate actions to address the economic and other challenges we face. see "item 1. business-industry overview and economic outlook" for a discussion of our end-markets, and item 1a- risk factors for further discussion of the risks related to us and our business.
executive overview we are the largest equipment rental company in the world, with an integrated network of 1,584 rental locations. we primarily operate in the united states and canada, and have a limited presence in europe, australia and new zealand (see item 2-properties for further detail). although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse, we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because, as a larger company, we have more extensive resources and certain competitive advantages. these include a fleet of rental equipment with a total original equipment cost ("oec") of $20.7 billion, and a north american branch network that operates in 49 u.s. states and every canadian province, and serves 99 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the u.s. our size also gives us greater purchasing power, the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services, the ability to provide customers with equipment that is more consistently well-maintained and therefore more productive and reliable, and the ability to enhance the earning potential of our assets by transferring equipment among branches to satisfy customer needs.
we offer approximately 4,800 classes of equipment for rent to a diverse customer base that includes construction and industrial companies, manufacturers, utilities, municipalities, homeowners and government entities. our revenues are derived from the following sources: equipment rentals, sales of rental equipment, sales of new equipment, contractor supplies sales and service and other revenues. in 2023, equipment rental revenues represented 84 percent of our total revenues.
for the past several years, as we continued to manage the impact of covid-19, we executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth, margin expansion and operational efficiencies. in particular, we have focused on customer segmentation, customer service differentiation, rate management, fleet management and operational efficiency. our general strategy focuses on profitability and return on invested capital, and, in particular, calls for:
•a consistently superior standard of service to customers, often provided through a single lead contact who can coordinate the cross-selling of the various services we offer throughout our network. we utilize a proprietary software application, total control®, which provides our key customers with a single in-house software application that enables them to monitor and manage all their equipment needs. total control® is a unique customer offering that enables us to develop strong, long-term relationships with our larger customers. our digital capabilities, including our total control® platform, allow our sales teams to provide contactless end-to-end customer service;
•the further optimization of our customer mix and fleet mix, with a dual objective: to enhance our performance in serving our current customer base, and to focus on the accounts and customer types that are best suited to our strategy for profitable growth. we believe these efforts will lead to even better service of our target accounts, primarily large construction and industrial customers, as well as select local contractors. our fleet team's analyses are aligned with these objectives to identify trends in equipment categories and define action plans that can generate improved returns;
•a continued focus on "lean" management techniques, including kaizen processes focused on continuous improvement. we have a dedicated team responsible for reducing waste in our operational processes, with the objectives of: condensing the cycle time associated with preparing equipment for rent; optimizing our resources for delivery and pickup of equipment; improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our repair and maintenance operations; and implementing customer service best practices;
•the continued expansion and cross-selling of adjacent specialty and services products, which enables us to provide a "one-stop" shop for our customers. we believe that the expansion of our specialty business, as exhibited by our acquisition of general finance corporation ("general finance") in may 2021, as well as our tools and onsite services offerings, will further position united rentals as a single source provider of total jobsite solutions through our extensive product and service resources and technology offerings; and
•the pursuit of strategic acquisitions to continue to expand our core equipment rental business, as exhibited by our recently completed acquisition of assets of ahern rentals, inc. ("ahern rentals"), which is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. strategic acquisitions allow us to invest our capital to expand our business, further driving our ability to accomplish our strategic goals. .
as discussed below, fleet productivity is a comprehensive metric that reflects the combined impact of changes in rental rates, time utilization, and mix that contribute to the variance in owned equipment rental revenue. for the full year 2023:
•equipment rentals increased 19.3 percent year-over-year, including the impact of the ahern rentals acquisition that was completed in december 2022, which is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. on a pro forma basis including the standalone, pre-acquisition results of ahern rentals, equipment rentals increased 11.3 percent year-over-year;
•average oec increased 21.9 percent year-over-year, including the impact of the ahern rentals acquisitions. on the pro forma basis, average oec increased 10.4 percent year-over-year;
•fleet productivity decreased 0.7 percent. on the pro forma basis, fleet productivity increased 2.8 percent; and
•67 percent of equipment rental revenue was derived from key accounts. key accounts are each managed by a single point of contact to enhance customer service.
financial overview prior to taking actions pertaining to our financial flexibility and liquidity, we assess our available sources and anticipated uses of cash, including, with respect to sources, cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment. in 2023, we took the following actions to improve our financial flexibility and liquidity, and to position us to invest the necessary capital in our business (see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt instruments):
•amended our accounts receivable securitization facility, primarily to increase the size of the facility from $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. the facility expires in june 2024 and may be extended on a 364-day basis by mutual agreement with the purchasers under the facility; and
•amended and extended our uncommitted repurchase facility, pursuant to which we may obtain short-term financing in an amount up to $100. the facility expires in june 2024 and may be further extended by the mutual consent of the parties to the repurchase facility agreement.
as of december 31, 2023, we had available liquidity of $3.330 billion, comprised of cash and cash equivalents, and availability under the abl and accounts receivable securitization facilities.
in october 2022, our board of directors authorized a $1.25 billion share repurchase program. this program was paused through the initial phase of the integration of the ahern rentals acquisition, and repurchases began in the first quarter of 2023. we repurchased $1.00 billion under the program in 2023 and expect to complete the program in the first quarter of 2024. on january 24, 2024, our board of directors authorized a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program. we plan to begin repurchases under the new program following the planned completion of the existing $1.25 billion share repurchase program in the first quarter of 2024, and intend to purchase $1.25 billion under the new program in 2024 and then complete the program by the end of the first quarter of 2025. a 1 percent excise tax is imposed on "net repurchases" (certain purchases minus certain issuances)
of common stock. the repurchases above, as well as the total program sizes, do not include the excise tax, which totaled $8 in 2023.
our board of directors also approved our first-ever quarterly dividend program in january 2023, and the first dividend under the program was paid in february 2023. we did not pay any dividends prior to 2023, and in 2023, we paid dividends totaling $406 ($5.92 per share, which equates to a quarterly dividend per share of $1.48). on january 24, 2024, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $1.63 per share, payable on february 28, 2024 to stockholders of record on february 14, 2024.

(1)this reflects transaction costs associated with the general finance acquisition that was completed in may 2021. merger related costs only include costs associated with major acquisitions completed since 2012 that significantly impact our operations (the "major acquisitions," each of which had annual revenues of over $200 prior to acquisition).
(2)this reflects the amortization of the intangible assets acquired in the major acquisitions. the increase in 2023 primarily reflects the impact of the ahern rentals acquisition.
(3)this reflects the impact of extending the useful lives of equipment acquired in certain major acquisitions, net of the impact of additional depreciation associated with the fair value mark-up of such equipment. the increase in 2023 primarily reflects the impact of the ahern rentals acquisition.
(4)this reflects additional costs recorded in cost of rental equipment sales associated with the fair value mark-up of rental equipment acquired in certain major acquisitions that was subsequently sold. the increase in 2023 primarily reflects the impact of the ahern rentals acquisition.
(5)this primarily reflects severance and branch closure charges associated with our restructuring programs. for additional information on the restructuring charges, which generally involve the closure of a large number of branches over a short period of time, often in periods following a major acquisition, see "results of operations-other costs/(income)-restructuring charges" below. the increase in 2023 reflects charges associated with a restructuring program initiated following the closing of the ahern rentals acquisition. as of december 31, 2023, there were no open restructuring programs.
(6)this reflects write-offs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets.
(7)reflects the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes. for additional information, see "results of operations-other costs/(income)-interest expense, net" below.
ebitda gaap reconciliations. ebitda represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. adjusted ebitda represents ebitda plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. see below for further detail on each adjusting item. these items are excluded from adjusted ebitda internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. the net income and adjusted ebitda margins represent net income or adjusted ebitda divided by total revenue. management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda, when viewed with the company's results under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. additionally, management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. however, ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and, accordingly, should not be considered as alternatives to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity.

(1)this reflects transaction costs associated with the general finance acquisition that was completed in may 2021. merger related costs only include costs associated with major acquisitions completed since 2012 that significantly impact our operations.
(2)this primarily reflects severance and branch closure charges associated with our restructuring programs. for additional information on the restructuring charges, which generally involve the closure of a large number of branches over a short period of time, often in periods following a major acquisition, see "results of operations-other costs/(income)-restructuring charges" below. the increase in 2023 reflects charges associated with a restructuring program initiated following the closing of the ahern rentals acquisition. as of december 31, 2023, there were no open restructuring programs.
(3)represents non-cash, share-based payments associated with the granting of equity instruments.
(4)this reflects additional costs recorded in cost of rental equipment sales associated with the fair value mark-up of rental equipment acquired in certain major acquisitions that was subsequently sold. the increase in 2023 primarily reflects the impact of the ahern rentals acquisition.
(5)this primarily reflects the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes. for additional information, see "results of operations-other costs/(income)-interest expense, net" below.
for the year ended december 31, 2023, net income increased $319, or 15.2 percent, and net income margin decreased 120 basis points to 16.9 percent. for the year ended december 31, 2023, adjusted ebitda increased $1.239 billion, or 22.1 percent, and adjusted ebitda margin decreased 50 basis points to 47.8 percent.
the year-over-year decrease in net income margin primarily reflects the impact of the ahern rentals acquisition on gross margins from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment, increased restructuring charges associated with the ahern rentals acquisition, and increased interest expense, partially offset by reductions in selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") and income tax expenses as a percentage of revenue. depreciation and repairs and maintenance expenses for the rental equipment acquired in the ahern rentals acquisition were higher than for our other rental equipment, which negatively impacted equipment rentals gross margin year-over-year. in addition to the impact of the ahern rentals acquisition, the decreased gross margin from sales of rental equipment reflects the normalization of the used equipment market and the expanded use of wholesale channels. net interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2022 included debt redemption losses of $17. excluding the impact of these losses, interest expense, net for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased by
48.4 percent year-over-year primarily due to increased average debt, including the debt issued to partially fund the ahern rentals acquisition, and higher interest rates (the weighted average interest rates on our variable debt instruments were 6.3 percent in 2023 and 3.3 percent in 2022). the favorable margin impact of sg&a expense reflects better fixed cost absorption on higher revenue. while income tax expense increased $90, or 12.9 percent, year-over-year, the effective income tax rate decreased slightly, from 24.9 percent to 24.5 percent.
the decrease in the adjusted ebitda margin primarily reflects an 80 basis point decrease in equipment rentals gross margin (excluding depreciation and stock compensation expense) and a 470 basis point decrease in gross margin from sales of rental equipment (excluding the adjustment reflected in the table above for the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet), partially offset by reduced sg&a expense as a percentage of revenue. the decreased gross margin from equipment rentals (excluding depreciation and stock compensation expense) primarily reflects the impact of the ahern rentals acquisition (in particular, repairs and maintenance expense for the rental equipment acquired in the ahern rentals acquisition was higher than for our other rental equipment, which negatively impacted equipment rentals gross margin year-over-year). the decreased gross margin from sales of rental equipment (excluding the adjustment for the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet) primarily reflects the normalization of the used equipment market, the expanded use of wholesale channels, and the impact of the ahern rentals acquisition. the favorable margin impact of sg&a expense reflects better fixed cost absorption on higher revenue.

(1)reflects the estimated impact of inflation on the revenue productivity of fleet based on oec, which is recorded at cost.
(2)reflects the combined impact of changes in rental rates, time utilization, and mix that contribute to the variance in owned equipment rental revenue. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the different types of equipment rentals revenue. rental rate changes are calculated based on the year-over-year variance in average contract rates, weighted by the prior period revenue mix. time utilization is calculated by dividing the amount of time an asset is on rent by the amount of time the asset has been owned during the year. mix includes the impact of changes in customer, fleet, geographic and segment mix. the positive fleet productivity for 2022 reflected strong demand across our end-markets. covid-19, which resulted in rental volume declines in response to shelter-in-place orders and other market restrictions, had the most pronounced on our business in 2020. beginning in 2021 and continuing through 2023, we have experienced broad-based strength of demand across our end-markets.
(3)reflects the combined impact of changes in the other types of equipment rentals revenue (see note 3 for further detail), excluding owned equipment rental revenue.
(4)we completed the acquisition of ahern rentals in december 2022. the pro forma information includes the standalone, pre-acquisition results of ahern rentals. the pro forma components are not reflected above for 2022 versus 2021 because of the december 2022 acquisition date (ahern rentals did not materially impact the comparison of 2022 and 2021 equipment rentals). the ahern rentals acquisition is discussed further in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment, as well as revenue related to the fees we charge customers: for equipment delivery and pick-up; to protect the customer against liability for damage to our equipment while on rent; for fuel; and for environmental costs. collectively, these "ancillary fees" represented approximately 16 percent of equipment rental revenue in 2023. delivery and pick-up revenue, which represented approximately eight percent of equipment rental revenue in 2023, is the most significant ancillary revenue component. sales of rental equipment represent our revenues from the sale of used rental equipment. sales of new equipment represent our revenues from the sale of new equipment. contractor supplies sales represent our sales of supplies utilized by contractors, which include construction consumables, tools, small equipment and safety supplies. services and other revenues primarily represent our revenues earned from providing repair and maintenance services on our customers' fleet (including parts sales). see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting.
2023 total revenues of $14.3 billion increased 23.1 percent compared with 2022. equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment are our largest revenue types (together, they accounted for 95 percent of total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2023). equipment rentals increased 19.3 percent, primarily due to a 21.9 percent increase in average oec, partially offset by a 0.7 percent decrease in fleet productivity. the increase in average oec includes the impact of the acquisition of ahern rentals that is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. on a pro forma basis including the pre-acquisition results of ahern rentals, year-over-year, equipment rentals increased 11.3 percent, primarily reflecting an increase in average oec of 10.4 percent and increased fleet productivity of 2.8 percent. beginning in 2021 and continuing through december 31, 2023, we have experienced broad-based strength of demand across our end-markets. sales of rental equipment increased 63.1 percent year-over-year, primarily reflecting the normalization of volumes, after we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment in 2022 to ensure sufficient rental capacity for our customers, as well as the impact of sales of rental equipment acquired in the ahern rentals acquisition. pricing on sales of rental equipment remains strong.
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap. a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. in applying many accounting principles, we make assumptions, estimates and/or judgments. these assumptions, estimates and/or judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis. material changes in these assumptions, estimates and/or judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations. we have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates and/or judgments. although actual results may differ from those estimates, we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate.
allowance for credit losses. we maintain allowances for credit losses. these allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical write-off experience and, as applicable, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectibility. our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances, including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers. accordingly, we may be required to increase or decrease our allowances. trade receivables that have contractual maturities of one year or less are written-off when they are determined to be uncollectible based on the criteria necessary to qualify as a deduction for federal tax purposes. write-offs of such receivables require management approval based on specified dollar thresholds. see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.
useful lives and salvage values of rental equipment and property and equipment. we depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives, after giving effect to an estimated salvage value which ranges from zero percent to 50 percent of cost. the weighted average salvage value of our rental equipment is 12 percent of cost (immaterial salvage values are assigned to our property and equipment). rental equipment is depreciated whether or not it is out on rent.
the useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period over which the asset can generate revenues; such periods are periodically reviewed for reasonableness. in addition, the salvage value, which is also reviewed periodically for reasonableness, is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we will realize from the asset after such period. we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances. if these estimates change in the future, we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets.
to the extent that the useful lives of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one year, we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately $265 or $346, respectively. if the estimated salvage values of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one percentage point, we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would change by approximately $27. any change in depreciation expense as a result of a hypothetical change in either useful lives or salvage values would generally result in a proportional increase or decrease in the gross profit we would recognize upon the ultimate sale of the asset. to the extent that the useful lives of all of our depreciable property and equipment were to increase or decrease by one year, we estimate that our annual non-rental depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately $42 or $64, respectively.
acquisition accounting. we have made a number of acquisitions in the past and may continue to make acquisitions in the future. the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. long-lived assets (principally rental equipment), goodwill and other intangible assets generally represent the largest components of our acquisitions. rental equipment is valued utilizing either a cost, market or income approach, or a combination of certain of these methods, depending on the asset being valued and the availability of market or income data. goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired business over the net of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. the intangible assets that we have acquired are non-compete agreements, customer relationships and trade names and associated trademarks. the estimated fair values of these intangible assets reflect various assumptions about discount rates, revenue growth rates, operating margins, terminal values, useful lives and other prospective financial information. non-compete agreements, customer relationships and trade names and associated trademarks are valued based on an excess earnings or income approach based on projected cash flows.
determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired can be judgmental in nature and can involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions. the significant judgments include estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on forecasts; estimation of the long-term rate of growth; estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur; and determination of a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. when appropriate, our estimates of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired include assistance from independent third-party appraisal firms. the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired, as well as the estimated life of the assets, can materially impact net income in periods subsequent to the acquisition through depreciation and amortization, and in certain instances through impairment charges, if the asset becomes impaired in the future. as discussed below, we regularly review for impairments.
when we make an acquisition, we also acquire other assets and assume liabilities. these other assets and liabilities typically include, but are not limited to, parts inventory, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other working capital items. because of their short-term nature, the fair values of these other assets and liabilities generally approximate the book values on the acquired entities' balance sheets.
evaluation of goodwill impairment. goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred. application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including: the identification of reporting units; assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units; assignment of goodwill to reporting units; determination of the fair value of each reporting unit; and an assumption as to the form of the transaction in which the reporting unit would be acquired by a market participant (either a taxable or nontaxable transaction).
when conducting the goodwill impairment test, we are required to compare the fair value of our reporting units (which are our regions) with the carrying amount. as discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, our divisions are our operating segments. we conduct the goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the operating segment level.
financial accounting standards board ("fasb") guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and a market approach based on market price data of shares of our company and other corporations engaged in similar businesses as well as acquisition multiples paid in recent transactions. we believe this approach, which utilizes multiple valuation techniques, yields the most appropriate evidence of fair value.
inherent in our preparation of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results, business plans, expected growth rates, cost of capital and tax rates. we also make certain forecasts about future economic conditions, interest rates and other market data. many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management, and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods. changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit, and therefore could affect the likelihood and amount of potential impairment. the following assumptions are significant to our income approach:
business projections- we make assumptions about the level of equipment rental activity in the marketplace and cost levels. these assumptions drive our planning assumptions for pricing and utilization and also represent key inputs for developing our cash flow projections. these projections are developed using our internal business plans over a ten-year planning period that are updated at least annually;
long-term growth rates- beyond the planning period, we also utilize an assumed long-term growth rate representing the expected rate at which a reporting unit's cash flow stream is projected to grow. these rates are used to calculate the terminal value of our reporting units, and are added to the cash flows projected during our ten-year planning period; and discount rates- each reporting unit's estimated future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted-average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by market participants. the weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise.
the market approach is one of the other methods used for estimating the fair value of our reporting units' business enterprise. this approach takes two forms: the first is based on the market value (market capitalization plus interest-bearing liabilities) and operating metrics (e.g., revenue and ebitda) of companies engaged in the same or similar line of business. the second form is based on multiples paid in recent acquisitions of companies.
in connection with our goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of october 1, 2023, we bypassed the optional qualitative assessment for each reporting unit and quantitatively compared the fair values of our reporting units with their carrying amounts. our goodwill impairment testing as of this date indicated that all of our reporting units, excluding our mobile storage reporting unit, had estimated fair values which exceeded their respective carrying amounts by at least 54 percent. we completed the acquisition of general finance in may 2021, and all of the assets in the mobile storage reporting unit were acquired in the general finance acquisition. the estimated fair value of our mobile storage reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by eight percent. as all of the assets in the mobile storage reporting unit were recorded at fair value as of the may 2021 acquisition date, we expected the percentage by which the fair value for this reporting unit exceeded the carrying value to be significantly less than the equivalent percentages determined for our other reporting units.
in connection with our goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of october 1, 2022, we bypassed the optional qualitative assessment for each reporting unit and quantitatively compared the fair values of our reporting units with their carrying amounts. our goodwill impairment testing as of this date indicated that all of our reporting units, excluding our mobile storage reporting unit, had estimated fair values which exceeded their respective carrying amounts by at least 37 percent. we completed the acquisition of general finance in may 2021, and all of the assets in the mobile storage reporting unit were acquired in the general finance acquisition. the estimated fair value of our mobile storage reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by eight percent. as all of the assets in the mobile storage reporting unit were recorded at fair value as of the may 2021 acquisition date, we expected the percentage by which the fair value for this reporting unit exceeded the carrying value to be significantly less than the equivalent percentages determined for our other reporting units.
impairment of long-lived assets (excluding goodwill). we review the recoverability of our rental equipment, property and equipment, lease assets and other intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. if there are such indications, we assess our ability to recover the carrying value of the assets from their expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). if the expected cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value. we also conduct impairment reviews in connection with branch consolidations and other changes in our business. there were no asset impairment charges recognized in 2023, and during the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded asset impairment charges of $3 and $14, respectively, primarily in depreciation of rental equipment in our consolidated statements of income. these charges were primarily recognized in our general rentals segment.
in support of our review for indicators of impairment, we perform a review of all assets at the district level relative to district performance and conclude whether indicators of impairment exist associated with our long-lived assets, including rental equipment. we also specifically review the financial performance of our rental equipment. such review includes an estimate of the future rental revenues from our rental assets based on current and expected utilization levels, the age of the assets and their remaining useful lives. additionally, we estimate when the assets are expected to be removed or retired from our rental fleet as well as the expected proceeds to be realized upon disposition. based on our most recently completed quarterly reviews, there were no indications of impairment associated with our rental equipment, property and equipment, lease assets or other intangible assets.
income taxes. we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for certain future deductible or taxable temporary differences expected to be reported in our income tax returns. these deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the related future deductible or taxable temporary difference is expected to be settled or realized. in the case of deferred tax assets, the future realization of the deferred tax benefits and carryforwards are determined with consideration to historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and tax planning strategies. after consideration of all these factors, we recognize deferred tax assets when we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize them. the most significant positive evidence that we consider in the recognition of deferred tax assets is the expected reversal of cumulative deferred tax liabilities resulting from book versus tax depreciation of our rental equipment fleet that is well in excess of the deferred tax assets.
we use a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return regarding uncertainties in income tax positions. the first step is recognition: we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. the second step is measurement: a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
we are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. accordingly, accruals for tax contingencies are established based on the probable outcomes of such matters. our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the examinations and related tax accruals require judgment and could increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results.
we have historically considered the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested, and, accordingly, no taxes were provided on such earnings prior to the fourth quarter of 2020. in 2021, we remitted the cumulative amount of identified cash in our foreign operations in excess of near-term working capital needs. the taxes recorded associated with the remitted cash were immaterial. we continue to expect that the remaining balance of our undistributed foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested. if we determine that all or a portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and u.s. state income taxes.
results of operations as discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, our reportable segments are general rentals and specialty. the general rentals segment includes the rental of construction, aerial, industrial and homeowner equipment and related services and activities. the general rentals segment's customers include construction and industrial companies, manufacturers, utilities, municipalities, homeowners and government entities. this segment operates throughout the united states and canada. the specialty segment rents products (and provides setup and other services on such rented equipment) including i) trench safety equipment, such as trench shields, aluminum hydraulic shoring systems, slide rails, crossing plates, construction lasers and line testing equipment for underground work, ii) power and hvac equipment, such as portable diesel generators, electrical distribution equipment, and temperature control equipment, iii) fluid solutions equipment primarily used for fluid containment, transfer and treatment, and iv) mobile storage equipment and modular office space. the specialty segment's customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects, municipalities and industrial companies. this segment primarily operates in the united states and canada, and has a limited presence in europe, australia and new zealand.
as discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, our general rentals reporting segment reflects the aggregation of four geographic divisions-central, northeast, southeast and west. historically, there have occasionally been variances in the levels of equipment rentals gross margins achieved by these divisions, though such variances have generally been small (close to or less than 10 percent, measured versus the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals' divisions). for the five year period ended december 31, 2023, there was no general rentals' division with an equipment rentals gross margin that differed materially from the equipment rentals gross margin of the aggregated general rentals' divisions. the rental industry is cyclical, and there historically have occasionally been divisions with equipment rentals gross margins that varied by greater than 10 percent from the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals' divisions, though the specific divisions with margin variances of over 10 percent have fluctuated, and such variances have generally not exceeded 10 percent by a significant amount. we monitor the margin variances and confirm margin similarity between divisions on a quarterly basis.
we believe that the divisions that are aggregated into our segments have similar economic characteristics, as each division is capital intensive, offers similar products to similar customers, uses similar methods to distribute its products, and is subject to similar competitive risks. the aggregation of our divisions also reflects the management structure that we use for making operating decisions and assessing performance. although we believe aggregating these divisions into our reporting segments for segment reporting purposes is appropriate, to the extent that there are significant margin variances that do not converge, we may be required to disaggregate the divisions into separate reporting segments. any such disaggregation would have no impact on our consolidated results of operations.
these reporting segments align our external segment reporting with how management evaluates business performance and allocates resources. we evaluate segment performance primarily based on segment equipment rentals gross profit. our revenues, operating results, and financial condition fluctuate from quarter to quarter reflecting the seasonal rental patterns of our customers, with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter.

equipment rentals. 2023 equipment rentals of $12.1 billion increased 19.3 percent, primarily due to a 21.9 percent increase in average oec, partially offset by a 0.7 percent decrease in fleet productivity. the increase in average oec includes the impact of the acquisition of ahern rentals that is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. on a pro forma basis including the pre-acquisition results of ahern rentals, year-over-year, equipment rentals increased 11.3 percent, primarily reflecting an increase in average oec of 10.4 percent and increased fleet productivity of 2.8 percent. beginning in 2021 and continuing through december 31, 2023, we have experienced broad-based strength of demand across our end-markets.
on a segment basis, equipment rentals represented 82 percent and 90 percent of total revenues for general rentals and specialty, respectively. general rentals equipment rentals increased 19.9 percent as compared to 2022, primarily due to strong demand across our end-markets and increased average oec, which includes the impact of the ahern rentals acquisition. on a pro forma basis including the pre-acquisition results of ahern rentals, year-over-year, equipment rentals increased 9.1 percent, primarily reflecting increases in average oec and fleet productivity. specialty rentals increased 17.7 percent as compared to 2022, primarily due to strong demand across our end-markets and increased average oec. as noted above, beginning in 2021 and continuing through december 31, 2023, we have experienced broad-based strength of demand across our end-markets.
sales of rental equipment. for the three years in the period ended december 31, 2023, sales of rental equipment represented approximately 10 percent of our total revenues. 2023 sales of rental equipment of $1.6 billion increased 63.1 percent from 2022, primarily reflecting the normalization of volumes, after we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment in 2022 to ensure sufficient rental capacity for our customers, as well as the impact of sales of rental equipment acquired in the ahern rentals acquisition. pricing on sales of rental equipment remains strong.
sales of new equipment. for the three years in the period ended december 31, 2023, sales of new equipment represented approximately 2 percent of our total revenues. 2023 sales of new equipment of $218 increased 41.6 percent from 2022, primarily reflecting some individually significant sales in 2023 and normal variability.
contractor supplies sales. for the three years in the period ended december 31, 2023, sales of contractor supplies represented approximately 1 percent of our total revenues. 2023 sales of contractor supplies did not change materially from 2022.
service and other revenues. for the three years in the period ended december 31, 2023, service and other revenues represented approximately 2 percent of our total revenues. 2023 service and other revenues increased 17.4 percent from 2022 primarily due to growth initiatives.
fourth quarter items. there were no unusual or infrequently occurring items recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 that had a material impact on our financial statements. in the fourth quarter of 2022, we issued $1.5 billion principal amount of 6 percent senior secured notes due 2029. the issued debt, together with drawings on our abl facility, was used to fund the december 2022 ahern rentals acquisition that is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
segment equipment rentals gross profit segment equipment rentals gross profit and gross margin for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2023 were as follows:
general                  specialty                    total rentals
2023
equipment rentals gross profit            $3,219                    $1,595                     $4,814

2021
equipment rentals gross profit            $2,269                      $998                     $3,267
equipment rentals gross margin              37.4    %                 46.8     %                 39.8   %
general rentals. for the three years in the period ended december 31, 2023, general rentals accounted for 68 percent of our total equipment rentals gross profit. this contribution percentage is consistent with general rentals' equipment rental revenue contribution over the same period. for the year ended december 31, 2023, general rentals' equipment rentals gross profit increased by $314, and equipment rentals gross margin decreased by 300 basis points, from 2022, primarily due to the impact of the ahern rentals acquisition. as a percentage of revenue, depreciation and repairs and maintenance expenses for the rental equipment acquired in the ahern rentals acquisition were higher than for our other rental equipment, which negatively impacted equipment rentals gross margin year-over-year.
specialty. for the year ended december 31, 2023, equipment rentals gross profit increased by $255, and equipment rentals gross margin increased by 50 basis points from 2022.
gross margin. gross margins by revenue classification were as follows:

2023 gross margin of 40.6 percent decreased 230 basis points from 2022. equipment rentals gross margin decreased 210 basis points from 2022, primarily due to the impact of the ahern rentals acquisition. as a percentage of revenue, depreciation and repairs and maintenance expenses for the rental equipment acquired in the ahern rentals acquisition were higher than for our other rental equipment, which negatively impacted equipment rentals gross margin year-over-year. gross margin from sales of rental equipment decreased 880 basis points from 2022, primarily due to the normalization of the used equipment market, the expanded use of wholesale channels, and the impact of the ahern rentals acquisition. the equipment acquired in the ahern rentals acquisition was recorded at fair value as of the december 2022 acquisition date, and the gross margins on the sale of such acquired equipment were less than the gross margins achieved upon the sale of other rental equipment. as reflected in the above gross margin, pricing on sales of rental equipment remains strong. the gross margin fluctuations from sales of new equipment, contractor supplies sales and service and other revenues generally reflect normal variability, and such revenue types did not account for a significant portion of total gross profit (gross profit for these revenue types represented 4 percent of total gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2023).
other costs/(income)
the table below includes the other costs/(income) in our consolidated statements of income, as well as key associated metrics, for the three years in the period ended december 31, 2023:

the merger related costs reflect transaction costs associated with the general finance acquisition that was completed in may 2021. we have made a number of acquisitions in the past and may continue to make acquisitions in the future. merger related costs only include costs associated with major acquisitions, each of which had annual revenues of over $200 prior to acquisition, that significantly impact our operations.
the restructuring charges primarily reflect severance and branch closure charges associated with our restructuring programs. we incur severance costs and branch closure charges in the ordinary course of our business. we only include such costs that are part of a restructuring program as restructuring charges. the designated restructuring programs generally involve the closure of a large number of branches over a short period of time, often in periods following a major acquisition, and result in significant costs that we would not normally incur absent a major acquisition or other triggering event that results in the initiation of a restructuring program. since the first such program was initiated in 2008, we have completed seven restructuring programs and have incurred total restructuring charges of $380.
in the first quarter of 2023, we initiated a restructuring program following the closing of the ahern rentals acquisition discussed above (such program is the reason for the year-over-year restructuring charge increase for the year ended december 31, 2023). this restructuring program was completed in the fourth quarter of 2023, and we currently have no open restructuring programs. as of december 31, 2023, the total liability associated with our restructuring programs was $21.
non-rental depreciation and amortization includes (i) the amortization of other intangible assets and (ii) depreciation expense associated with equipment that is not offered for rent (such as computers and office equipment) and amortization expense associated with leasehold improvements. our other intangible assets consist of customer relationships, non-compete agreements and trade names and associated trademarks. the year-over-year increase in non-rental depreciation and amortization for the year ended december 31, 2023 primarily reflects the impact of the ahern rentals acquisition.
interest expense, net for the year ended 2022 included aggregate debt redemption losses of $17. the debt redemption losses primarily reflected the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes. excluding the impact of these losses, interest expense, net for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased by 48.4 percent year-over-year primarily due to increased average debt, including the debt issued to partially fund the ahern rentals acquisition discussed above, and higher variable debt interest rates (the weighted average interest rates on our variable debt instruments were 6.3 percent in 2023 and 3.3 percent in 2022).
other (income) expense, net primarily includes (i) currency gains and losses, (ii) finance charges, (iii) gains and losses on sales of non-rental equipment and (iv) other miscellaneous items.
a detailed reconciliation of the effective tax rates to the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate is included in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.
balance sheet. accounts receivable, net increased by $226, or 11.3 percent, from december 31, 2022 to december 31, 2023 primarily due to increased revenue. prepaid expenses and other assets decreased by $246, or 64.6 percent, from december 31, 2022 to december 31, 2023, primarily due to the use of a portion of a tax receivable associated with the ahern rentals acquisition to reduce cash paid for income taxes (see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail). operating lease right-of-use assets increased by $280, or 34.2 percent, and operating lease liabilities increased by $253, or 39.4 percent, from december 31, 2022 to december 31, 2023, and both increases primarily reflected the impact of the ahern rentals acquisition, as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. accounts payable decreased by $234, or 20.5 percent, from december 31, 2022 to december 31, 2023, primarily reflecting normal variability in business activity and the timing of payments. see the consolidated statements of cash flows for further information on changes in cash and cash equivalents, the consolidated statements of stockholders' equity for further information on changes in stockholders' equity and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on short-term and long-term debt.
liquidity and capital resources.
we manage our liquidity using internal cash management practices, which are subject to (i) the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services, (ii) the terms and other requirements of the agreements to which we are a party and (iii) the statutes, regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate. see "financial overview" above for a summary of the 2023 capital structure actions taken to improve our financial flexibility and liquidity.
on october 24, 2022, our board of directors authorized a $1.25 billion share repurchase program. this program was paused through the initial phase of the integration of the ahern rentals acquisition, and repurchases began in the first quarter of 2023. we have repurchased $1.00 billion under the program through december 31, 2023 and expect to complete the program in the first quarter of 2024. on january 24, 2024, our board of directors authorized a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program. we plan to begin repurchases under the new program following the planned completion of the existing $1.25 billion share repurchase program in the first quarter of 2024, and intend to purchase $1.25 billion under the new program in 2024 and then complete the program by the end of the first quarter of 2025. a 1 percent excise tax is imposed on "net repurchases" (certain purchases minus certain issuances) of common stock. the repurchases above, as well as the total program sizes, do not include the excise tax, which totaled $8 in 2023. since 2012, we have repurchased a total of $5.965 billion (inclusive of immaterial excise taxes, which were first imposed in 2023) of holdings' common stock under our share repurchase programs (comprised of seven programs that have ended and the current program).
our board of directors also approved our first-ever quarterly dividend program in january 2023, and the first dividend under the program was paid in february 2023. we did not pay any dividends prior to 2023, and during 2023, we paid dividends totaling $406 ($5.92 per share, which equates to a quarterly dividend per share of $1.48). on january 24, 2024, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $1.63 per share, payable on february 28, 2024 to stockholders of record on february 14, 2024.
our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment, and borrowings available under our abl and accounts receivable securitization facilities. as of december 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $363. cash equivalents at december 31, 2023 consist of direct obligations of financial institutions rated a or better. we believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next 12 months. the table below presents financial information associated with our principal sources of cash as of and for the year december 31, 2023:

_________________
(1)    as discussed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the accounts receivable securitization facility expires on june 24, 2024 and may be extended on a 364-day basis by mutual agreement with the purchasers under the facility.
we expect that our principal short-term (over the next 12 months) and long-term needs for cash relating to our operations will be to fund (i) operating activities and working capital, (ii) the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale, (iii) payments due under operating leases, (iv) debt service, (v) share repurchases, (vi) dividends and (vii) acquisitions. we plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of cash. in addition, we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our real estate, the use of additional operating leases or other financing sources as market conditions permit. the table below presents information on payments coming due under the most significant categories of our needs for cash (excluding operating cash flows pertaining to normal business operations, such as human capital costs, which are not accurately estimable) as of december 31, 2023:
2024                                                       2025        2026            2027            2028        thereafter           total debt and finance leases (1)            $1,465          $985         $34          $2,539          $1,677          $4,882           $11,582

_________________
(1)    the payments due with respect to a period represent (i) in the case of debt and finance leases, the scheduled principal payments due in such period, and (ii) in the case of operating leases, the payments due in such period for non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further debt information, and note 13 for further finance lease and operating lease information.
(2)    estimated interest payments have been calculated based on the principal amount of debt and the applicable interest rates as of december 31, 2023.
(3)    as of december 31, 2023, we had outstanding advance purchase orders, which were negotiated in the ordinary course of business, with our equipment and inventory suppliers. these purchase orders can generally be cancelled by us without cancellation penalties. the equipment and inventory receipts from the suppliers pursuant to these purchase orders and the related payments to the suppliers are expected to be completed primarily throughout 2024.
the amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and growth prospects. we expect that we will fund such expenditures from cash generated from operations, proceeds from the sale of rental and non-rental equipment and, if required, borrowings available under the abl and accounts receivable securitization facilities. net payments for rental capital expenditures (defined as payments for purchases of rental equipment less the proceeds from sales of rental equipment) were $2.140 billion, $2.471 billion and $2.030 billion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
to access the capital markets, we rely on credit rating agencies to assign ratings to our securities as an indicator of credit quality. lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to debt capital markets. credit ratings also affect the costs of derivative transactions, including interest rate and foreign currency derivative transactions. as a result, negative changes in our credit ratings could adversely impact our costs of funding. our credit ratings as of january 22, 2024 were as follows:
corporate rating        outlook moody's                       ba1                     stable standard &amp; poor's         bb+                     stable a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. there is no assurance that any rating will remain in effect for a given period of time or that any rating will not be revised or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future.
loan covenants and compliance. as of december 31, 2023, we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the abl, accounts receivable securitization, term loan and repurchase facilities and the senior notes. any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations.
the only financial covenant that currently exists under the abl facility is the fixed charge coverage ratio. subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility, the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the abl facility will only apply in the future if specified availability under the abl facility falls below 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the abl facility. when certain conditions are met, cash and cash equivalents and borrowing base collateral in excess of the abl facility size may be included when calculating specified availability under the abl facility. as of december 31, 2023, specified availability under the abl facility exceeded the required threshold and, as a result, this financial covenant was inapplicable. under our accounts receivable securitization facility, we are required, among other things, to maintain certain financial tests relating to: (i) the default ratio, (ii) the delinquency ratio, (iii) the dilution ratio and (iv) days sales outstanding. the accounts receivable securitization facility also requires us to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio under the abl facility, to the extent the ratio is applicable under the abl facility.
covenants in the agreements governing our abl facility, term loan facility and certain other debt instruments impose limitations on our ability to make share repurchases and dividend payments, subject to important exceptions that would allow us to make such repurchases or payments under certain conditions. based on our current total indebtedness leverage ratio (as defined in the applicable debt agreements) and usage of the abl facility as of december 31, 2023, we met the criteria under the applicable debt agreements for these exceptions, and as a result we were not restricted in our ability to make share repurchases and dividend payments.
sources and uses of cash. during 2023, we (i) generated cash from operating activities of $4.704 billion and (ii) generated cash from the sale of rental and non-rental equipment of $1.634 billion. we used cash during this period principally to (i) make payments for purchases of rental and non-rental equipment and intangible assets of $4.070 billion, (ii) purchase other companies for $574, (iii) purchase shares of our common stock for $1.070 billion and (iv) pay dividends of $406. during 2022, we (i) generated cash from operating activities of $4.433 billion, (ii) generated cash from the sale of rental and non-rental equipment of $989 and (iii) received cash from debt proceeds, net of payments, of $1.644 billion. we used cash during this period principally to (i) make payments for purchases of rental and non-rental equipment and intangible assets of $3.690 billion, (ii) purchase other companies for $2.340 billion and (iii) purchase shares of our common stock for $1.068 billion.
free cash flow gaap reconciliation we define "free cash flow" as net cash provided by operating activities less payments for purchases of, and plus proceeds from, equipment and intangible assets. the equipment and intangible asset items are included in cash flows from investing activities. management believes that free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements. however, free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under gaap. accordingly, free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity. the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow.

free cash flow for the year ended december 31, 2023 was $2.306 billion, an increase of $542 as compared to $1.764 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022. free cash flow increased primarily due to lower payments for net rental capital expenditures (payments for purchases of rental equipment less the proceeds from sales of rental equipment), which decreased $331, or 13 percent, year-over-year, and increased net cash provided by operating activities.
relationship between holdings and urna. holdings is principally a holding company and primarily conducts its operations through its wholly owned subsidiary, urna, and subsidiaries of urna. holdings licenses its tradename and other intangibles and provides certain services to urna in connection with its operations. these services principally include: (i) senior management services; (ii) finance and tax-related services and support; (iii) information technology systems and support; (iv) acquisition-related services; (v) legal services; and (vi) human resource support. in addition, holdings leases certain equipment and real property that are made available for use by urna and its subsidiaries.
information regarding guarantors of urna indebtedness urna is 100 percent owned by holdings and has certain outstanding indebtedness that is guaranteed by both holdings and, with the exception of its u.s. special purpose vehicle which holds receivable assets relating to the company's accounts receivable securitization facility (the "spv") and a foreign subsidiary holding company acquired in connection with the general finance acquisition, all of urna's u.s. subsidiaries (the "guarantor subsidiaries"). other than the guarantee by our canadian subsidiary of urna's indebtedness under the abl facility, none of urna's indebtedness is guaranteed by urna's foreign subsidiaries, the spv, or the foreign subsidiary holding company acquired in connection with the general finance acquisition (together, the "non-guarantor subsidiaries"). the receivable assets owned by the spv have been sold or contributed by urna to the spv and are not available to satisfy the obligations of urna or holdings' other subsidiaries. holdings consolidates each of urna and the guarantor subsidiaries in its consolidated financial statements. urna and the guarantor subsidiaries are all 100 percent-owned and controlled by holdings. holdings' guarantees of urna's indebtedness are full and unconditional, except that the guarantees may be automatically released and relieved upon satisfaction of the requirements for legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the applicable indenture being met. the holdings guarantees are also subject to subordination provisions (to the same extent that the obligations of the issuer under the relevant notes are subordinated to other debt of the issuer) and to a standard limitation which provides that the maximum amount guaranteed by holdings will not exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed without making the guarantee void under fraudulent conveyance laws.
the guarantees of holdings and the guarantor subsidiaries are made on a joint and several basis. the guarantees of the guarantor subsidiaries are not full and unconditional because a guarantor subsidiary can be automatically released and relieved of its obligations under certain circumstances, including sale of the guarantor subsidiary, the sale of all or substantially all of the guarantor subsidiary's assets, the requirements for legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the applicable indenture being met, designating the guarantor subsidiary as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the applicable covenants or the notes being rated investment grade by both standard & poor's ratings services and moody's investors service, inc., or, in certain circumstances, another rating agency selected by urna. like the holdings guarantees, the guarantees of the guarantor subsidiaries are subject to subordination provisions (to the same extent that the obligations of the issuer under the relevant notes are subordinated to other debt of the issuer) and to a standard limitation which provides that the maximum amount guaranteed by each guarantor will not exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed without making the guarantee void under fraudulent conveyance laws.
all of the existing guarantees by holdings and the guarantor subsidiaries rank equally in right of payment with all of the guarantors' existing and future senior indebtedness. the secured indebtedness of holdings and the guarantor subsidiaries (including guarantees of urna's existing and future secured indebtedness) will rank effectively senior to guarantees of any unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. future guarantees of subordinated indebtedness will rank junior to any existing and future senior indebtedness of the guarantors. the guarantees of urna's indebtedness are effectively junior to any indebtedness of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors, including our foreign subsidiaries. as of december 31, 2023, the indebtedness of our non-guarantors was comprised of (i) $1.300 billion of outstanding borrowings by the spv in connection with the company's accounts receivable securitization facility, (ii) $99 of outstanding borrowings under the abl facility by non-guarantor subsidiaries and (iii) $9 of finance leases of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.
covenants in the agreements governing our abl facility, term loan facility and certain other debt instruments impose limitations on our ability to make share repurchases and dividend payments, subject to important exceptions that would allow us to make such repurchases or payments under certain conditions. based on our current total indebtedness leverage ratio (as defined in the applicable debt agreements) and usage of the abl facility as of december 31, 2023, we met the criteria under the applicable debt agreements for these exceptions, and as a result we were not restricted in our ability to make share repurchases and dividend payments.
based on our understanding of rule 3-10 of regulation s-x ("rule 3-10"), we believe that holdings' guarantees of urna indebtedness comply with the conditions set forth in rule 3-10, which enables us to present summarized financial information for holdings, urna and the consolidated guarantor subsidiaries in accordance with rule 13-01 of regulation s-x. the summarized financial information excludes the financial information of the non-guarantor subsidiaries. in accordance with rule 3-10, separate financial statements of the guarantor subsidiaries have not been presented. our presentation below excludes the investment in the non-guarantor subsidiaries and the related income from the non-guarantor subsidiaries.
the summarized financial information of holdings, urna and the guarantor subsidiaries on a combined basis is as follows:

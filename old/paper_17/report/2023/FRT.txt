item 1a.    risk factors this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, section 21e of the exchange act and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. also, documents that we "incorporate by reference" into this annual report on form 10-k, including documents that we subsequently file with the sec will contain forward-looking statements. when we refer to forward-looking statements or information, sometimes we use words such as "may," "will," "could," "should," "plans," "intends," "expects," "believes," "estimates," "anticipates" and "continues." in particular, the below risk factors describe forward-looking information. the risk factors describe risks that may affect these statements but are not all-inclusive, particularly with respect to possible future events. many things can happen that can cause actual results to be different from those we describe. these factors include, but are not limited to the following:
risk factors related to our real estate investments and operations revenue from our properties may be reduced or limited if the retail operations of our tenants are not successful.
revenue from our properties depends primarily on the ability of our tenants to pay the full amount of rent and other charges due under their leases on a timely basis. some of our leases provide for the payment, in addition to base rent, of additional rent above the base amount according to a specified percentage of the gross sales generated by the tenants and generally provide for reimbursement of real estate taxes and expenses of operating the property. economic, legal, and/or competitive conditions, as well as public health concerns, may impact the success of our tenants' retail operations and therefore the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from our tenants. any reduction in our tenants' abilities to pay base rent, percentage rent, or other charges on a timely basis, including the closing of stores prior to the end of the lease term or the filing by any of our tenants for bankruptcy protection, will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. in the event of default by a tenant, we may experience delays and unexpected costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under lease terms, which may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
our net income depends on the success and continued presence of our "anchor" tenants.
our net income could be adversely affected in the event of a downturn in the business, or the bankruptcy or insolvency, of any anchor store or anchor tenant. anchor tenants generally occupy large amounts of square footage, pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant numbers of customers to a property. the closing of one or more anchor stores at a property could adversely affect that property and result in lease terminations by, or reductions in rent from, other tenants whose leases may permit termination or rent reduction in those circumstances or whose own operations may suffer as a result. over the past several years, we have seen higher levels of anchor turnover and closings in some markets, which has caused an oversupply of larger retail spaces. therefore, tenant demand for certain of our anchor spaces may decrease and as a result, we may see an increase in vacancy and/or a decrease in rents for those spaces that could have a negative impact to our net income. as of december 31, 2023, our anchor tenant space is 96.0% leased and 93.9% occupied.
a shift in retail shopping from brick and mortar stores to online shopping may have an adverse impact on our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.
many retailers operating brick and mortar stores have made online sales a vital piece of their business. the shift to online shopping may cause declines in brick and mortar sales generated by certain of our tenants and may cause certain of our tenants to reduce the size or number of their retail locations in the future. this risk is partially mitigated by our strategy of maintaining a diverse portfolio of retail properties. the trend of retailers utilizing brick and mortar locations for 'showroom' and on-line sales distribution purposes (particularly at shopping centers in densely populated areas like ours) may further mitigate this risk. however, there can be no assurance that our shopping centers will not be further impacted by the shift to online shopping. as a result, our cash flow, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
we have properties that are geographically concentrated, and adverse economic or real estate market declines in these areas could have a material adverse effect on us.
as of december 31, 2023, our tenants operated in 12 states and the district of columbia. any adverse situation that disproportionately affects the the markets where our properties are concentrated may have a magnified adverse effect on our portfolio. refer to "properties" (item 2 of this annual report on form 10-k) for additional discussion of the geographic concentration. real estate markets are subject to economic downturns, as they have been in the past, and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact this market in both the short and long term.
declines in the economy or a decline in the real estate market in these states could hurt our financial performance and the value of our properties. factors that may negatively affect economic conditions in these states include:
•business layoffs or downsizing;
•industry slowdowns;
•elevated levels of inflation over an extended period of time;
•increasing interest rates;
•increased business restrictions due to health crises;
•relocations of businesses;
•changing demographics;
•increased telecommuting and use of alternative work places;
•infrastructure quality;
•any oversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate;
•concessions or reduced rental rates under new leases for properties where tenants defaulted; and
•increased operating costs including insurance premiums and real estate taxes.
we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants that file for bankruptcy protection.
if a tenant or lease guarantor files for bankruptcy, we may not be able to collect all pre-petition amounts owed by that party. in addition, a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may terminate our lease in which event we would have a general unsecured claim that would likely be for less than the full amount owed to us for the remainder of the lease term, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or re-leasing space.
we derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants. we are subject to the risks that, upon expiration or termination of leases, whether by their terms, as a result of a tenant bankruptcy, general economic conditions or otherwise, leases for space in our properties may not be renewed, space may not be re-leased, or the terms of renewal or re-lease, including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than current lease terms and may include decreases in rental rates. as a result, our net income could be reduced.
our development activities have inherent risks.
the ground-up development of improvements on real property, as opposed to the renovation and redevelopment of existing improvements, presents substantial risks. we generally do not look to acquire raw land for future development; however, we do intend to complete the development and construction of future phases of projects we already own. we may undertake development of these and other projects on our own or bring in third parties if it is justifiable on a risk-adjusted return basis. we may also choose to delay completion of a project if market conditions do not allow an appropriate return. if conditions arise and we are not able or decide not to complete a project or if the expected cash flows of our project do not exceed the book value, an impairment of the project may be required. if additional phases of any of our existing projects or if any new projects are not successful, it may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
in addition to the risks associated with real estate investment in general, as described elsewhere and the specific risks above, the risks associated with our remaining development activities include:
•contractor changes may delay the completion of development projects and increase overall costs;
•significant time lag between commencement and stabilization subjects us to greater risks due to fluctuations in the general economy;
•delivery of residential product into uncertain residential environments may result in lower rents or longer time periods to reach economic stabilization;
•substantial amount of our investment is related to infrastructure and the overall value of the project may be negatively impacted if we do not complete subsequent phases;
•failure or inability to obtain construction or permanent financing on favorable terms;
•expenditure of money and time on projects that may never be completed;
•difficulty securing key anchor or other tenants may impact occupancy rates and projected revenue;
•inability to achieve projected rental rates or anticipated pace of lease-up;
•higher than estimated construction or operating costs, including labor and material costs; and
•possible delay in completion of a project because of a number of factors, including covid-19, supply chain disruptions and shortages, inflation, weather, labor disruptions, construction delays or delays in receipt of zoning or other regulatory approvals, acts of terror or other acts of violence, or acts of god (such as fires, earthquakes or floods).
redevelopments and acquisitions may fail to perform as expected.
our investment strategy includes the redevelopment and acquisition of high quality, retail focused properties in densely populated areas with high average household incomes and significant barriers to adding competitive retail supply. the redevelopment and acquisition of properties entail risks that include the following, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations:
•our estimate of the costs to improve, reposition or redevelop a property may prove to be too low, or the time we estimate to complete the improvement, repositioning or redevelopment may be too short. as a result, the property may fail to achieve the returns we have projected, either temporarily or for a longer period;
•we may not be able to identify suitable properties to acquire or may be unable to complete the acquisition of the properties we identify;
•we may not be able to integrate an acquisition into our existing operations successfully;
•properties we redevelop or acquire may fail to achieve the occupancy or rental rates we project, within the time frames we project, at the time we make the decision to invest, which may result in the properties' failure to achieve the returns we projected;
•our pre-acquisition evaluation of the physical condition of each new investment may not detect certain defects or identify necessary repairs until after the property is acquired, which could significantly increase our total acquisition costs or decrease cash flow from the property; and
•our investigation of a property or building prior to our acquisition, and any representations we may receive from the seller of such building or property, may fail to reveal various liabilities, which could reduce the cash flow from the property or increase our acquisition cost.
our performance and value are subject to general risks associated with the real estate industry.
our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets, and consequently, the value of our investments, are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected. as a real estate company, we are susceptible to the following real estate industry risks:
•economic downturns in general, or in the areas where our properties are located;
•adverse changes in local real estate market conditions, such as an oversupply or reduction in demand;
•changes in tenant preferences that reduce the attractiveness of our properties to tenants;
•zoning or regulatory restrictions;
•decreases in market rental rates;
•weather conditions that may increase or decrease energy costs and other weather-related expenses;
•costs associated with the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-lease space; and
•increases in the cost of adequate maintenance, insurance and other operating costs, including real estate taxes, associated with one or more properties, which may occur even when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in revenues from one or more properties, although real estate taxes typically do not increase upon a reduction in such revenues.
each of these risks could result in decreases in market rental rates and increases in vacancy rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.
many real estate costs are fixed, even if income from our properties decreases.
our financial results depend primarily on leasing space in our properties to tenants on terms favorable to us. costs associated with real estate investment, such as real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, generally are not reduced even when a property is not fully occupied, rental rates decrease, or other circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property. as a result, cash flow from the operations of our properties may be reduced if a tenant does not pay its rent or we are unable to rent our properties on favorable terms. under those circumstances, we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs. additionally, new properties that we may acquire or redevelop may not produce any significant revenue immediately, and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with such new properties until they are fully occupied.
competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties and generate sufficient income from tenants.
numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition. this competition may:
•reduce properties available for acquisition;
•increase the cost of properties available for acquisition;
•reduce rents payable to us;
•interfere with our ability to attract and retain tenants;
•lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties; and
•adversely affect our ability to minimize expenses of operation.
retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from online retailers, outlet stores, discount shopping clubs and other forms of sales and marketing of goods, such as direct mail. this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants. if we are unable to continue to attract appropriate retail tenants to our properties, or to purchase new properties in our geographic markets, it could materially affect our ability to generate net income, service our debt and make distributions to our shareholders.
we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid.
real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. in addition, there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to real estate and to reits in particular that may limit our ability to sell our assets. we may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions including being unable to sell a property at a return we believe is appropriate due to the economic environment. our inability to respond quickly to adverse changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our shareholders.
we may have limited flexibility in dealing with our jointly owned investments.
our organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in properties and assets owned jointly with other persons or entities. as of december 31, 2023, we held 19 predominantly retail real estate projects jointly with other persons in addition to properties owned in a "downreit" structure. additionally, as of december 31, 2023, we owned an interest in the hotel component of assembly row. we may make additional joint investments in the future. our existing and future joint investments may subject us to special risks, including the possibility that our partners or co-investors might become bankrupt, that those partners or co-investors might have economic or other business interests or goals which are unlike or incompatible with our business interests or goals, that those partners or co-investors might be in a position to take action contrary to our suggestions or instructions, or in opposition to our policies or objectives, and that disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the property or the joint venture, which may result in litigation or arbitration or some other form of dispute resolution. although as of december 31, 2023, we held the controlling interests in all of our existing co-investments (except the hotel investment discussed above, the investment in the la alameda shopping center acquired in 2017, and the investment in the chandler festival and chandler gateway shopping centers acquired in 2022), we generally must obtain the consent of the co-investor or meet defined criteria to sell or to finance these properties. joint ownership gives a third party the opportunity to influence the return we can achieve on some of our investments and may adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders. we may also be liable for the actions of our co-investors.
our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate.
we currently carry comprehensive insurance on all of our properties, including insurance for liability, fire, flood, earthquake, environmental matters, rental loss and acts of terrorism. all of these policies contain coverage limitations. we believe these coverages are of the types and amounts customarily obtained for or by an owner of similar types of real property assets located in the areas where our properties are located. we intend to obtain similar insurance coverage on subsequently acquired properties.
the availability of insurance coverage may decrease and the prices for insurance may increase as a consequence of significant losses incurred by the insurance industry and other factors outside our control. as a result, we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices. in addition, insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses, such as losses due to terrorist acts, pandemics, and toxic mold, or, if offered, the expense of obtaining these types of insurance may not be justified. we therefore may cease to have insurance coverage against certain types of losses and/or there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occurs, we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, but still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property. we cannot guarantee that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future. if any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could seriously disrupt our operations, delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property. also, due to inflation, changes in codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors, it may not be feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building after it has been damaged or destroyed. further, we may be unable to collect insurance proceeds if our insurers are unable to pay or contest a claim. events such as these could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations, including distributions to our shareholders.
natural disasters, climate change and health crises, could have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating results.
climate change may add to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters and severe weather conditions, impact the availability of natural resources, and create additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. certain of our operations are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, earthquakes, droughts, snow storms, floods and fires.  the impact of climate change or the occurrence of natural disasters can delay new development projects, increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties, increase operating costs, create additional investment costs to make improvements to existing properties to comply with climate change regulations, increase future property insurance costs, impact the availability of water and other natural resources, and negatively impact the tenant demand for space.  if insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or if our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption or losses from these events, our earnings, liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected.
in addition, our business is subject to risks related to the effects of public health crises, epidemics, and pandemics. such events could:
•inhibit global, national and local economic activity;
•drive inflation, adversely affect trading activity in securities markets, which could negatively impact the trading prices of our common shares and debt securities and our ability to access the securities markets as a source of liquidity;
•adversely affect our tenants' financial condition by limiting foot traffic and staffing at their businesses, which could affect their ability to pay rent and willingness to make new leasing commitments;
•reduce our cash flow, which could impact our ability to pay dividends at the current rate and in the current format or at all or to service our debt;
•temporarily or permanently reduce the demand for retail or office space;
•interfere with our business operations by requiring our personnel to work remotely;
•increase the frequency of cyber-attacks;
•disrupt supply chains that could be important in our development and redevelopment activities;
•result in labor shortages;
•interfere with potential purchases and sales of properties;
•impact our ability to pay dividends at the current rate and in the current format or at all; and
•have other direct and indirect effects that are difficult to predict.
such risks depend upon the nature and severity of the public health concern, as well as the extent and duration of government-mandated orders and personal decisions to limit travel, economic activity and personal interaction, none of which can be predicted with confidence. in particular, we cannot predict the impact of stay-at-home and other government orders instituted in response to a public health concern, which may vary by jurisdiction, or a public health concerns' short and long term economic effects, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
an increased focus on metrics and reporting related to corporate responsibility, specifically related to environmental, social and governance ("esg") factors, may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.
investors and other stakeholders have become more focused on understanding how companies address a variety of esg factors. many of those investors and shareholders look to esg rating systems, or disclosure frameworks that have been developed by third party groups to allow comparisons between companies on esg factors as they evaluate investment decisions as well as to company disclosures.
although we participate in many of these ratings systems, or disclosure frameworks, and generally score relatively well in those in which we do participate, we do not participate in, and would not necessarily score well in, all of the available ratings systems. further, the criteria used in these ratings systems change frequently, and we cannot guaranty that we will be able to score well as criteria change. we supplement our participation in ratings systems with corporate disclosures of our esg activities but many investors and stakeholders may look for specific disclosures that we do not provide. failure to participate in certain of the third party ratings systems, failure to score well in those ratings systems or failure to provide certain esg disclosures could result in reputational harm when investors or others compare us against similar companies in our industry and could cause certain investors to be unwilling to invest in our stock which could adversely impact our ability to raise capital.
for more information about the trust's corporate responsibility initiatives, see item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - corporate responsibility."
risk factors related to our funding strategies and capital structure the amount of debt we have and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect our business and financial condition.
as of december 31, 2023, we had approximately $4.6 billion of debt outstanding. of that outstanding debt, approximately $519.1 million was secured by all or a portion of 8 of our real estate projects. as of december 31, 2023, approximately 87.0% of our debt is fixed rate or is fixed via interest rate swap agreements, which includes all of our property secured debt and our unsecured senior notes. our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur. the amount of our debt outstanding from time to time could have important consequences to our shareholders. for example, it could:
•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for operations, property acquisitions, redevelopments and other appropriate business opportunities that may arise in the future;
•limit our ability to make distributions on our outstanding common shares and preferred shares;
•make it difficult to satisfy our debt service requirements;
•require us to dedicate increased amounts of our cash flow from operations to payments on debt upon refinancing or on our variable rate, unhedged debt, if interest rates rise;
•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the factors that affect the profitability of our business;
•limit our ability to obtain any additional debt or equity financing we may need in the future for working capital, debt refinancing, capital expenditures, acquisitions, redevelopments or other general corporate purposes or to obtain such financing on favorable terms; and/or
•limit our flexibility in conducting our business, which may place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt or debt with less restrictive terms.
our ability to make scheduled principal payments of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance, which to a certain extent is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or meet our other cash needs. if we are unable to generate this cash flow from our business, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt, sell assets or obtain additional financing to meet our debt obligations and other cash needs, including the payment of dividends required to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust. we cannot assure you that any such refinancing, sale of assets or additional financing would be possible on terms that we would find acceptable.
we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants pursuant to our debt obligations that could restrict our operating activities, and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate payment under our debt agreements.
our revolving credit facility, unsecured term loan, and certain series of notes include financial covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future. we are also required to comply with additional covenants that include, among other things, provisions:
•relating to the maintenance of property securing a mortgage;
•restricting our ability to pledge assets or create liens;
•restricting our ability to incur additional debt;
•restricting our ability to amend or modify existing leases at properties securing a mortgage;
•restricting our ability to enter into transactions with affiliates; and
•restricting our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.
as of december 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all of our default related financial covenants. if we were to breach any of our default related debt covenants, including the covenants listed above, and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period, our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately, and, if the debt is secured, could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan. many of our debt arrangements, including our public notes and our revolving credit facility, are cross-defaulted, which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations. as a result, any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares.
adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms.
our credit worthiness is rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. the credit ratings assigned are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, financial condition and prospects, and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and the economic outlook in general. our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we access, as well as the terms of certain existing and future financing we obtain. since we depend on debt financing to fund the growth of our business, an adverse change in our credit rating, including actual changes in outlook, or even the initiation of review of our credit rating that could result in an adverse change, could have a material adverse effect on us.
our ability to grow will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital.
our growth strategy is focused on the development and redevelopment of properties we already own and the acquisition of additional properties. we believe that it will be difficult to fund our expected growth with cash from operating activities because, in addition to other requirements, we are generally required to distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of our taxable income each year to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes. as a result, we must rely primarily upon the availability of debt or equity capital, which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all. debt could include the sale of debt securities and mortgage loans from third parties. if economic conditions and conditions in the capital markets are not favorable at the time we need to raise capital, we may need to obtain capital on less favorable terms. additionally, we cannot guarantee that additional financing, refinancing or other capital will be available in the amounts we desire or on favorable terms. our access to debt or equity capital depends on a number of factors, including the market's perception of our growth potential and risk profile, our ability to pay dividends, and our current and potential future earnings. depending on the outcome of these factors as well as the impact of the economic environment, we could experience delay or difficulty in implementing our growth strategy on satisfactory terms, or be unable to implement this strategy.
rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our outstanding debt and preferred shares.
of our $4.6 billion of debt outstanding as of december 31, 2023, approximately $853.6 million bears interest at a variable rate, of which, $600.0 million is our unsecured term loan that bears interest at a variable rate of sofr plus 85 basis points plus 0.10%. the remaining $253.6 million is comprised of a $200.0 million mortgage payable that bears interest at a variable rate of sofr plus 95 basis points, which is effectively fixed by three interest rate swap agreements through the initial maturity date, and $53.6 million in mortgages payable that bear interest at a variable rate of sofr plus 195 basis points and are effectively fixed by two interest rate swap agreements. we also have a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility, on which no balance was outstanding at december 31, 2023, that bears interest at sofr plus 77.5 basis points, plus 0.10%. we may borrow additional funds at variable interest rates in the future. increases in interest rates would increase the interest expense on our variable rate debt and reduce our cash flow, which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our shareholders. we may enter into additional hedging arrangements or other transactions for all or a portion of our variable rate debt to limit our exposure to rising interest rates. however, the amounts we are required to pay under variable rate debt to which hedging or similar arrangements relate may increase in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to any such hedging arrangements. in addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our debt securities and preferred shares to demand a higher annual yield, which could adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities and preferred shares and the cost and/or timing of refinancing or issuing additional debt securities or preferred shares.
hedging activity may expose us to risks, including the risks that a counterparty will not perform and that the hedge will not yield the economic benefits we anticipate, which may adversely affect us.
we may use derivative instruments to manage exposure to variable interest rate risk. we generally enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt. these and similar hedging arrangements involve risks, including the risks that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes, that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing reits, and that these arrangements may reduce the benefits to us if interest rates decline. developing and implementing an interest rate risk strategy is complex, and there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will be completely effective at insulating us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.
additionally, in connection with our offering in january 2024 of 3.25% exchangeable senior notes due 2029, we have entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties. the capped call transactions cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of common shares initially underlying the notes. the capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common shares upon any exchange of notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of exchanged notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. the option counterparties are financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that any or all of them might default under the capped call transactions. our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral. global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of certain financial institutions and could adversely impact the option counterparties' performance under the capped call transactions. if an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to the termination amount at that time as determined pursuant to the capped call documentation with such option counterparty. our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of the common shares. in addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to the common shares. we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.
risk factors related to our reit status and other laws and regulations environmental laws and regulations could reduce the value or profitability of our properties.
all real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations relating to hazardous materials, environmental protection and human health and safety. under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we and our tenants may be responsible for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in properties we own or operate, as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property). this liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about, or were responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. further, the presence of contamination on our properties or the failure to properly remediate contamination at any of our properties may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease those properties or to borrow funds by using those properties as collateral. the costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate. we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations taken as a whole.
in addition, changes in government legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also require us to spend more on our development or redevelopment projects without a corresponding increase in revenues, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the americans with disabilities act of 1990 could require us to take remedial steps with respect to existing or newly acquired properties.
our existing properties, as well as properties we may acquire, as commercial facilities, are required to comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act of 1990. investigation of a property may reveal non-compliance with this act. the requirements of this act, or of other federal, state or local laws or regulations, also may change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons. future compliance with this act may require expensive changes to the properties.
the revenues generated by our tenants could be negatively affected by various federal, state and local laws to which they are subject.
we and our tenants are subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations, such as local licensing requirements, consumer protection laws and state and local fire, life-safety and similar requirements that affect the use of the properties. the leases typically require that each tenant comply with all laws and regulations. failure to comply could result in fines by governmental authorities, awards of damages to private litigants, or restrictions on the ability to conduct business on such properties. non-compliance of this sort could reduce our revenues from a tenant, could require us to pay penalties or fines relating to any non-compliance, and could adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a property.
failure to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes would cause the parent company to be taxed as a corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of distributions.
we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes and currently intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit under the code. however, we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as such in the future.
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions and applicable income tax regulations that have been issued under the code. certain facts and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit. for example, in order to qualify as a reit, at least 95% of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying rents and certain other income. satisfying this requirement could be difficult, for example, if defaults by tenants were to reduce the amount of income from qualifying rents. as a reit, we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90% of our taxable income. in addition, new legislation, new regulations, new administrative interpretations or new court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. any modification in the tax treatment of reits could have a significant adverse impact to our net income.
if we fail to qualify as a reit:
•we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing taxable income;
•we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;
•unless we are entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified;
•we could be required to pay significant income taxes, which would substantially reduce the funds available for investment or for distribution to our shareholders for each year in which we failed or were not permitted to qualify; and
•we would no longer be required by law to make any distributions to our shareholders.
to maintain our status as a reit, we limit the amount of shares any one shareholder of the parent company can own.
the code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a reit. for example, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the code) during the last half of any taxable year. to protect our reit status, the parent company's declaration of trust prohibits any one shareholder from owning (actually or constructively) more than 9.8% in value of the outstanding common shares or of any class or series of outstanding preferred shares. the constructive ownership rules are complex. shares of the parent company's capital stock owned, actually or constructively, by a group of related individuals and/or entities may be treated as constructively owned by one of those individuals or entities. as a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% in value of the outstanding common shares and/or a class or series of preferred shares (or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns common shares or preferred shares) by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity (or another) to own constructively more than 9.8% in value of the outstanding capital stock. if that happens, either the transfer of ownership would be void or the shares would be transferred to a charitable trust and then sold to someone who can own those shares without violating the 9.8% ownership limit.
the board of trustees may waive these restrictions on a case-by-case basis. in addition, the board of trustees and two-thirds of our shareholders eligible to vote at a shareholder meeting may remove these restrictions if they determine it is no longer in our best interests for the parent company to attempt to qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a reit. the 9.8% ownership restrictions may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of our control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the shareholders' best interest.
legislative, administrative, regulatory or other actions affecting reits, including positions taken by the irs, could have a material adverse effect on us and our investors.
the rules dealing with u.s. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, and by the internal revenue service ("irs") and the u.s. department of the treasury ("treasury"). changes to the tax laws or interpretations thereof by the irs and the treasury, with or without retroactive application, could materially and adversely affect us and our investors. no prediction can be made as to the likelihood of passage of new tax legislation or other provisions, or the direct or indirect effect on us and our shareholders. accordingly, such new legislation, treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify to be taxed as a reit and/or the u.s. federal income tax consequences to us and our investors of such qualification.
certain tax and anti-takeover provisions of the parent company's declaration of trust and bylaws, and certain restrictions in the partnership's limited partnership agreement, may inhibit a change of our control.
certain provisions contained in the parent company's declaration of trust and bylaws and the maryland general corporation law, as applicable to maryland reits, may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us. if this were to happen, it could delay, deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management. these provisions also may delay or prevent the shareholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over then-prevailing market prices. these provisions include:
•the reit ownership limit described above;
•authorization of the issuance of our preferred shares with powers, preferences or rights to be determined by the board of trustees;
•special meetings of our shareholders may be called only by the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer, the president, by one-third of the trustees or by shareholders possessing no less than 25% of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting;
•the board of trustees, without a shareholder vote, can classify or reclassify unissued shares of beneficial interest, including the reclassification of common shares into preferred shares and vice-versa;
•a two-thirds shareholder vote is required to approve some amendments to the declaration of trust; and
•advance-notice requirements for proposals to be presented at shareholder meetings.
in addition, if we elect to be governed by it in the future, the maryland control share acquisition law could delay or prevent a change in control. under maryland law, unless a reit elects not to be subject to this law, "control shares" acquired in a "control share acquisition" have no voting rights except to the extent approved by shareholders by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding shares owned by the acquirer and by officers or trustees who are employees of the reit. "control shares" are voting shares that would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing trustees within specified ranges of voting power. a "control share acquisition" means the acquisition of control shares, with some exceptions.
the parent company's bylaws state that the maryland control share acquisition law will not apply to any acquisition by any person of our common shares. this bylaw provision may be repealed, in whole or in part, at any time, whether before or after an acquisition of control shares, by a vote of a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote, and, upon such repeal, may, to the extent provided by any successor bylaw, apply to any prior or subsequent control share acquisition.
in addition, certain provisions in the partnership's limited partnership agreement (the "partnership agreement") may delay or make more difficult unsolicited acquisitions of us or changes in our control. these provisions could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an unsolicited acquisition of us or change of our control, although some shareholders might consider such proposals, if made, desirable. these provisions also make it more difficult for third parties to alter the management structure of the partnership without the concurrence of our board of trustees. these provisions include, among others:
•redemption rights of limited partners and certain assignees of units of limited partnership interest ("op units");
•transfer restrictions on op units and restrictions on admissions of partners;
•a requirement that the general partner may not be removed as the general partner of the partnership without its consent;
•the ability of the general partner to issue preferred partnership interests in the partnership with terms that it may determine, without the approval or consent of any limited partner; and
•restrictions on the ability of the general partner, the partnership or the parent company to transfer its interests in the partnership or otherwise engage in certain extraordinary transactions, including, among others, certain mergers, business combinations, sales of all or substantially all of their assets and recapitalizations.
we may be required to incur additional debt to qualify as a reit.
as a reit, we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90% of our taxable income. we are subject to income tax on amounts of undistributed taxable income and net capital gain. in addition, we would be subject to a 4% excise tax if we fail to distribute sufficient income to meet a minimum distribution test based on our ordinary income, capital gain and aggregate undistributed income from prior years. we intend to make distributions to shareholders to comply with the code's distribution provisions and to avoid federal income and excise tax. we may need to borrow funds to meet our distribution requirements because:
•our income may not be matched by our related expenses at the time the income is considered received for purposes of determining taxable income; and
•non-deductible capital expenditures, creation of reserves, or debt service requirements may reduce available cash but not taxable income.
in these circumstances, we might have to borrow funds on terms we might otherwise find unfavorable and we may have to borrow funds even if our management believes the market conditions make borrowing financially unattractive. current tax law also allows us to pay a portion of our distributions in shares instead of cash.
general risk factors the market value of our debt and equity securities is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility.
as with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our debt and equity securities depends on various factors, which may change from time to time and/or may be unrelated to our financial condition, operating performance or prospects that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility in such prices. these factors include, among others:
•general economic and financial market conditions;
•level and trend of interest rates;
•our ability to access the capital markets to raise additional capital;
•the issuance of additional equity or debt securities;
•changes in our funds from operations ("ffo") or earnings estimates;
•changes in our credit or analyst ratings;
•our financial condition and performance;
•market perception of our business compared to other reits; and
•market perception of reits, in general, compared to other investment alternatives.
we cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends in the current composition or at historical rates.
our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at historical rates or to increase our common share dividend rate, and our ability to pay preferred share dividends and service our debt securities, will depend on a number of factors, including, among others, the following:
•our financial condition and results of future operations;
•the performance by our tenants under their contractual lease agreements;
•the terms of our loan covenants; and
•our ability to acquire, finance, develop or redevelop and lease additional properties at attractive rates.
if we do not maintain or increase, or if we change the composition of the dividend on our common shares, it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and other securities. any preferred shares we may offer in the future may have a fixed dividend rate that would not increase with any increases in the dividend rate of our common shares. conversely, payment of dividends on our common shares may be subject to payment in full of the dividends on any preferred shares and payment of interest on any debt securities we may offer.
the parent company is a holding company with no direct operations, and it will rely on funds received from the partnership to pay its obligations and make distributions to its shareholders.
the parent company is a holding company and expects to conduct substantially all of its operations through the partnership. the parent company will not have, apart from an interest in the partnership, any independent operations. as a result, the parent company will rely on distributions from the partnership to make any distributions we declare on our common shares. the parent company will also rely on distributions from the partnership to meet its obligations, including any tax liability on taxable income allocated to the parent company from the partnership. through its ownership and control of the general partner, the parent company exercises exclusive control over the partnership, including the authority to cause the partnership to make distributions, subject to certain limited approval and voting rights of the partnership's limited partners as described in the partnership agreement. in addition, because the parent company is a holding company, your claims as shareholders are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations to preferred equity holders of the partnership and its subsidiaries. therefore, in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or reorganization of the partnership or its subsidiaries, assets of the partnership or the applicable subsidiary will be available to satisfy any claims of our shareholders only after such liabilities and obligations have been satisfied in full.
we currently own 100% of the op units issued by the partnership and are its sole limited partner. however, in connection with our future acquisition activities or otherwise, we may issue additional op units to third parties and admit additional limited partners. such issuances would reduce the parent company's percentage ownership in the partnership.
loss of our key management could adversely affect performance and the value of our common shares.
we are dependent on the efforts of our key management. although we believe qualified replacements could be found for any departures of key executives, the loss of their services could adversely affect our performance and the value of our common shares.
we may adjust our business policies without shareholder approval.
we may modify our approach to investment, financing, borrowing, and other operating strategies without shareholder approval. a change in the approach to any of these items could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, and the market price of our securities.
our current business plan focuses on our investment in high quality retail based properties that are typically neighborhood and community shopping centers or mixed-use properties, principally through redevelopments and acquisitions. if this business plan is not successful, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements that we make, including those in this annual report on form 10-k. except as may be required by law, we make no promise to update any of the forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. you should carefully review the above risks and the risk factors.
we face risks relating to cyber threats that could cause loss of confidential information and other business disruptions.
we rely extensively on information technology systems to process transactions and manage our business, and our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity incidents. these could include attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and computer systems as well as attacks on third party's information technology systems that we rely on to provide important information technology services relating to key business functions, such as payroll. cyber attacks can be both individual and/or highly organized attempts by very sophisticated hacking organizations. a cyber attack could compromise the confidential information of our employees, tenants, and vendors. a successful attack could adversely affect our business operations, results of operations, or financial condition by, among other things, disrupting our collection of revenue, interfering with our ability to satisfy our financial obligations by restricting access to our assets, or causing inaccuracies in our financial reporting. we employ a number of measures to prevent, detect, and mitigate these threats, which include password encryption, multi-factor authentication, frequent password change events, firewall detection systems, anti-virus software in-place, frequent backups, a redundant data system for core applications, and penetration testing; however, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a material cybersecurity incident.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 that are not included in this form 10-k can be found in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in part ii, item 7 of our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2022 filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 8, 2023.
forward-looking statements certain statements in this section or elsewhere in this report may be deemed "forward-looking statements". see "item 1a. risk factors" in this report for important information regarding these forward-looking statements and certain risk and uncertainties that may affect us. the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.
overview federal realty investment trust (the "parent company" or the "trust") is an equity real estate investment trust ("reit"). federal realty op lp (the "operating partnership") is the entity through which the trust conducts substantially all of its operations and owns substantially all of its assets. the trust owns 100% of the limited liability company interest of, is sole member of, and exercises exclusive control over federal realty gp llc (the "general partner"), which in turn, is the sole general partner of the operating partnership. unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, "we," "our," and "us" means the trust and its business and operations conducted through its directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries, including the operating partnership. we specialize in the ownership, management, and redevelopment of high quality retail and mixed-use properties located primarily in communities where we believe demand exceeds supply, in strategically selected metropolitan markets in the northeast and mid-atlantic regions of the united states, california, and south florida. as of december 31, 2023, we owned or had a majority interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixed-use properties which are operated as 102 predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 26.0 million commercial square feet. in total, the real estate projects were 94.2% leased and 92.2% occupied at december 31, 2023. we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our dividends per common share for 56 consecutive years.
general economic conditions the heightened levels of inflation, higher interest rates, and the potentially worsening of economic conditions presents risks for our business and our tenants. we continue to monitor and address risks related to the general state of the economy. we believe that the actions we have taken to improve our financial position and maximize our liquidity will continue to mitigate the impact to our cash flow caused by tenants not timely paying contractual rent.
additional discussion of the impact of current economic conditions on our results and long-term operations can be found throughout item 7 and item 1a. risk factors.
corporate responsibility we actively endeavor to operate and develop our properties in a sustainable, responsible, and effective manner with the objective being to drive long-term growth and aid in value creation for our shareholders, tenants, employees, and local communities. we have aligned our program and efforts with the united nations sustainable development goals, as described in our esg policy and our 2022 environmental social and governance report, which are provided only for informational purposes on our website and not incorporated by reference herein.
we are committed to implementing sustainable business practices at our operating properties that focus on energy efficiency, water conservation and waste minimization and have established greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions reduction targets in accordance with the science-based targets initiative as well as energy reduction targets. to achieve these targets, we are actively addressing energy efficiency projects on site such as upgrading to led lighting, procuring green energy, reducing electric consumption, and increasing our onsite solar generation capacity. we have installed on-site solar systems at 26 of our properties with a capacity of 14 mw with more projects actively in progress. we also installed electric vehicle car charging stations in numerous properties throughout our portfolio. we currently have over 400 charging stations in operation with more under construction.
we also understand that we face risks presented by climate change and are working to evaluate our risk exposure. in our 2022 sustainability report, we provided a disclosure pursuant to the task force on climate related financial disclosure and we intend to provide that disclosure annually.
we are also highly committed to our employees and fostering a work environment that promotes growth, development and personal well-being. our four core values are accountability, excellence, innovation and integrity and we seek to attract and retain talented professionals who embrace those values. all of our efforts with respect to corporate responsibility are overseen by our board of trustees.
our development activities have been heavily focused on owning, developing and operating properties that are certified under the u.s. green building council's® ("usgbc") leadership in energy and environmental designtm (leed®) rating system which serves as a third-party verification that a building or community was designed and built to mitigate its environmental footprint. we currently have 21 leed certified buildings and our pike & rose project has achieved leed for neighborhood development stage 3 gold certification.
cyber security our chief information officer, who has over 30 years of experience in managing information systems for real estate companies, heads our internal team of technology professionals who are responsible for managing our cybersecurity risks, which includes identifying our primary areas of risk, establishing processes, procedures, and systems to mitigate those risks and identifying and remediating any breaches that may occur. cybersecurity risk management falls under our general counsel as part of our overall risk management program, which is ultimately overseen by the audit committee of the board of trustees. our team is supported by a third party company that we have retained to act as our chief information security officer based on the third party company's experience in preventing cybersecurity incidents, advising clients about appropriate cybersecurity procedures and processes, and assessing the integrity of those procedures and processes. the assessment and management of our cybersecurity risks covers all of our internal systems as well as the systems of third parties who maintain our data.
we rely on our management team's experience in risk management, in consultation with our third party advisor, to appropriately address cybersecurity threats. as part of our processes to manage risks from cybersecurity threats, we have developed and enforce company-wide policies related to password encryption, strength and expiration, we require multi-factor authentication where appropriate, and we conduct regular employee training about our policies and cybersecurity threats. we make use of firewalls, anti-virus software, backups, redundancies, regular penetration testing, and our systems monitor and flag irregularities in how our information systems are accessed or used. any known cybersecurity incidents would be reported by our chief information officer to our general counsel and disclosure committee for evaluation and remediation, and for a determination of how we might develop further security systems and procedures to address evolving cybersecurity threats. management provides written and verbal updates to the audit committee at least quarterly identifying our primary areas of risk, actions taken or planned to be taken to mitigate those risks, and specific activities undertaken during the quarter, including employee training and the results of that training. management would also provide updates to seek oversight from the audit committee on an ad hoc basis in connection with any material cybersecurity incident, should one occur.
we have not experienced any cybersecurity incident that has had a material impact on our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. for more information, see item 1a. risk factors ("we face risks relating to cybersecurity threats that could cause loss of confidential information and other business distributions").
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, referred to as "gaap", requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses. these estimates are prepared using management's best judgment, after considering past and current events and economic conditions. in addition, information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information, external market information, when available, and when necessary, information obtained from consultations with third party experts. actual results could differ from these estimates. a discussion of possible risks which may affect these estimates is included in "item 1a. risk factors" of this report. management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements; however, the most critical accounting policies, which are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and involve the use of complex estimates and significant assumptions as to future uncertainties and, therefore, may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates, are as follows:
collectibility of lease income our leases with our tenants are classified as operating leases. when collection of substantially all lease payments during the lease term is considered probable, the lease qualifies for accrual accounting. when collection of substantially all lease payments during the lease term is not considered probable, total lease revenue is limited to the lesser of revenue recognized under accrual accounting or cash received. determining the probability of collection of substantially all lease payments during a lease term requires significant judgment. this determination is impacted by numerous factors including our assessment of the tenant's credit worthiness, economic conditions, tenant sales productivity in that location, historical experience with the tenant and tenants operating in the same industry, future prospects for the tenant and the industry in which it operates, and the length of the lease term. if leases currently classified as probable are subsequently reclassified as not probable, any outstanding lease receivables (including straight-line rent receivables) would be written-off with a corresponding decrease in rental income. for example, in the event that our collectibility determinations were not accurate and we were required to write off additional receivables equaling 1% of rental income, our rental income and net income would decrease by $11.3 million. if leases currently classified as not probable are subsequently changed to probable, any lease receivables (including straight-line rent receivables) are re-instated with a corresponding increase to rental income.
our collectibility related adjustments for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 resulted in a decrease to rental income of $0.4 million and an increase to rental income of $4.1 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, the revenue from approximately 28% and 31% of our tenants (based on total commercial leases), respectively, is being recognized on a cash basis. as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, our straight-line rent receivables balance was $138.4 million and $126.6 million, respectively, and is included in "accounts and notes receivable, net" on our consolidated balance sheet.
real estate acquisitions upon acquisition of operating real estate properties, we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired including land, building, improvements, leasing costs, intangibles such as acquired leases, assumed debt, and current assets and liabilities, if any. based on these estimates, we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities. we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. the value allocated to acquired leases is amortized over the related lease term and reflected as rental income in the statement of operations. we consider qualitative and quantitative factors in evaluating the likelihood of a tenant exercising a below market renewal option and include such renewal options in the calculation of in-place lease value when we consider these to be bargain renewal options. if the value of below market lease intangibles includes renewal option periods, we include such renewal periods in the amortization period utilized. if a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease, the unamortized balance of any acquired lease value is written off to rental income.
during 2022 and 2023, we acquired properties included in our consolidated financial statements with a total purchase price of $509.1 million. $3.4 million, or 1% of the total purchase price was allocated to above market lease assets and $39.9 million, or 8% was allocated to below market lease liabilities. if the amounts allocated in 2022 and 2023 to below market lease liabilities and building assets were each reduced by 5% of the total purchase price, annual below market lease liability amortization increasing rental income would decrease by approximately $2.2 million (using the weighted average life of below market liabilities at each respective acquired property) and annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately $0.7 million (using a depreciable life of 35 years).
long-lived assets and impairment there are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which the actual results will be determined over long periods of time. this includes the recoverability of long-lived assets, including our properties that have been acquired or redeveloped and our investment in certain joint ventures. management's evaluation of impairment includes review for possible indicators of impairment as well as, in certain circumstances, undiscounted and discounted cash flow analysis. since most of our investments in real estate are wholly-owned or controlled assets which are held for use, a property with impairment indicators is first tested for impairment by comparing the undiscounted cash flows, taking into account the anticipated hold period, including residual value, to the current net book value of the property. if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the net book value, the property is written down to expected fair value.
the calculation of both discounted and undiscounted cash flows requires management to make estimates of future cash flows including revenues, operating expenses, required maintenance and development expenditures, market conditions, demand for space by tenants and rental rates over long periods. because our properties typically have a long life, the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management judgment. we are also required to estimate the anticipated hold period. a change in the expected holding period from a long term hold to a short term would cause a significant change in the undiscounted cash flows and could result in an impairment charge. actual results could be significantly different from the estimates. these estimates have a direct impact on net income, because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income.
recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
2023 acquisitions and dispositions on january 31, 2023, we acquired the 168,000 square foot portion of huntington square shopping center that was not previously owned, as well as the fee interest in the land underneath the portion of the shopping center which we controlled under a long-term ground lease for $35.5 million. as a result of this transaction, we now own the entire fee interest in this 243,000 square foot property and the "operating lease right of use assets, net" on our consolidated balance sheet decreased by $5.3 million. approximately $4.1 million and $1.3 million of net assets acquired were allocated to other assets for "acquired lease costs" and "above market leases," respectively.
on may 26, 2023, we exercised our option and acquired the 22.3% tenancy in common ("tic") interest from our co-owner at escondido promenade for $30.5 million, bringing our ownership interest to 100%. as a result of the transaction, we gained control of this property, and effective may 26, 2023, we have consolidated this property. approximately $1.8 million and $0.2 million of net assets associated with the 22.3% interest acquired were allocated to other assets for "acquired lease costs" and "above market leases," respectively, and $1.1 million of net assets associated with the 22.3% interest acquired were allocated to other liabilities for "below market leases."
on october 12, 2023, we acquired the fee interest under a portion of our mercer on one (formerly mercer mall) shopping center for $55.0 million pursuant to the purchase option included in the master lease. as a result of this transaction, "finance lease right of use assets, net" of $37.8 million were allocated to "operating real estate" and "finance lease liabilities" decreased by $55.0 million.
during the year ended december 31, 2023, we sold one retail property and one portion of a property for sales prices totaling $30.4 million, resulting in net gains totaling approximately $9.7 million.
2023 significant debt and equity transactions for the three months ended december 31, 2023, we sold 1,220,842 common shares (of which, 62,895 settled on january 2, 2024) at a weighted average price per share of $101.30 for net cash proceeds of $122.4 million including paying $1.2 million in commissions and $0.1 million in additional operating expenses related to the sales of these common shares. for the year ended december 31, 2023, we sold 1,372,889 common shares (of which, 62,895 settled on january 2, 2024) at a weighted average price per share of $101.89 for net cash proceeds of $138.3 million including paying $1.4 million in commissions and $0.2 million in additional offering expenses related to the sales of these common shares. as of december 31, 2023, we had the capacity to issue up to $312.1 million in common shares under our atm equity program.
on april 12, 2023, we issued $350.0 million of fixed rate senior unsecured notes that mature on may 1, 2028 and bear interest at 5.375%. the notes were offered at 99.590% of the principal amount with a yield to maturity of 5.468%. the net proceeds, after issuance discount, underwriting fees, and other costs were $345.7 million. the net proceeds of these notes, or "green bonds," will be allocated to the financing and refinancing of recently completed and future eligible green projects, which includes (i) investments in acquisitions of buildings; (ii) building developments or redevelopments; (iii) renovations in existing buildings; and (iv) tenant improvement projects, in each case that have received, or are expected to receive, in the three years prior to the issuance of the notes or during the term of the notes, a leed gold or platinum certification (or environmentally equivalent successor standards). net proceeds will be available for repayment of indebtedness, or may be invested in short-term income-producing investments or may be used to temporarily repay current and/or future amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility.
effective may 4, 2023, our declaration of trust was amended to increase the number of authorized common shares of beneficial interest to 200,000,000.
on june 1, 2023, we repaid our $275.0 million 2.75% senior unsecured notes at maturity.
on december 28, 2023, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into a $200.0 million mortgage loan, which bears interest at sofr, plus a 95 basis point spread, matures on december 28, 2025, plus two one-year extensions, at our option, and is secured by our bethesda row property. the interest rate is effectively fixed at 5.03% through the initial maturity date, as a result of three interest rate swap agreements. our net proceeds were $199.1 million, after debt issuance costs. our subsidiary's obligations under the mortgage loan are guaranteed by the operating partnership.
2024 significant debt transactions on january 11, 2024, our operating partnership issued $485.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% exchangeable senior notes (the "notes") that mature on january 15, 2029, unless earlier exchanged, purchased or redeemed. on or after july 15, 2028, the notes will be exchangeable for cash up to the principal amount of the notes and, if applicable, cash, common shares of the trust, or a combination thereof at our option, in respect of the remainder, if any, of the exchange obligation in excess of the principal amount. the exchange rate initially equals 8.1436 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of the notes (equivalent to an exchange price of approximately $122.80 per common share). net proceeds after the initial purchaser's discount and estimated offering costs were approximately $471 million.
in connection with the notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain of the initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates or other financial institutions. the capped call transactions cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of our common shares that initially underlie the notes. the capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common shares upon exchange of any notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of the notes, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. the cap price of the capped call transaction initially is approximately $143.26 per share, which represents a premium of approximately 40% over the last reported sale price of our common shares of $102.33 on the new york stock exchange on january 8, 2024, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions. a portion of the proceeds from the notes were used to pay the capped call premium of $19.4 million, which will be recorded in shareholders' equity for the trust and capital for the operating partnership.
on january 16, 2024, we repaid the $600.0 million 3.95% senior unsecured notes at maturity.
capitalized costs certain external and internal costs directly related to the development, redevelopment and leasing of real estate, including pre-construction costs, real estate taxes, insurance, and construction costs and salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved, are capitalized. we capitalized external and internal costs related to both development and redevelopment activities of $183 million and $10 million, respectively, for 2023 and $278 million and $11 million, respectively, for 2022. we capitalized external and internal costs related to other property improvements of $91 million and $4 million, respectively, for 2023 and $111 million and $4 million, respectively, for 2022. we capitalized external and internal costs related to leasing activities of $20 million and $3 million, respectively, for 2023 and $18 million and $4 million, respectively, for 2022. the amount of capitalized internal costs for salaries and related benefits for development and redevelopment activities, other property improvements, and leasing activities were $9 million, $4 million, and $3 million, respectively, for 2023 and $10 million, $3 million, and $4 million, respectively, for 2022. total capitalized costs were $312 million for 2023 and $425 million for 2022, respectively.
outlook our long-term growth strategy is focused on growth in earnings, funds from operations, and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following:
•growth in our comparable property portfolio,
•growth in our portfolio from property redevelopments and expansions, and
•expansion of our portfolio through property acquisitions.
although general economic impacts of elevated levels of inflation and rising interest rates are impacting us in the short-term, our long-term focus has not changed.
our comparable property growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals, changes in portfolio occupancy, and the redevelopment of those assets. over the long-term, the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide a strategic advantage allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and generally increase rental rates. we continue to experience strong demand for our commercial space as evidenced by the 2.0 million square feet of comparable space leasing we've completed in 2023, and the 2.0% spread between our leased rate of 94.2% and our occupied rate of 92.2%. during 2023, we have seen an uptick in tenants filing for bankruptcy compared to the prior two years. as a result, approximately 290,000 square feet of anchor space became vacant during the second half of 2023, of which, approximately 38,000 is leased to a replacement tenant. this will negatively impact our occupancy and net income in the short term, however, we expect to be able to re-lease the space at similar or better aggregate rents over the next several quarters, and we are actively in negotiations with replacement tenants. additionally, the effects of high levels of inflation and rising interest rates continue to negatively impact our business with the largest impacts being higher interest costs, increased material costs, and higher operating costs. we continue to see impacts of increased costs for certain construction and other materials that support our development and redevelopment activities. worsening supply chain disruptions could also result in extended time frames and/or increased costs for completion of our projects and tenant build-outs, which could delay the commencement of rent payments under new leases. similarly, if our tenants experience significant disruptions in supply chains supporting their own products, staffing issues due to labor shortages, or are otherwise impacted by worsening economic conditions, their ability to pay rent may be adversely affected. we continue to monitor these macroeconomic developments and are working with our tenants and our vendors to limit the overall impact to our business.
we believe the locations and nature of our centers and diverse tenant base partially mitigates any potential negative changes in the economic environment. however, any significant reduction in our tenants' abilities to pay base rent, percentage rent or other charges, will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. we seek to maintain a mix of strong national, regional, and local retailers. at december 31, 2023, no single tenant accounted for more than 2.7% of annualized base rent.
we continue to have several development projects in process being delivered as follows:
•phase iv at pike & rose is a 276,000 square foot office building (which includes 10,000 square feet of ground floor retail space). approximately 172,000 square feet of the office space is leased to two tenants, and approximately 8,000 square feet of retail is leased. the building is expected to cost between $185 million and $200 million, and began delivering in late september 2023. as of december 31, 2023, approximately 109,000 square feet of office space is open.
•construction on santana west includes an eight story 376,000 square foot office building, which is expected to cost between $315 million and $330 million. approximately 29,000 square feet of space is leased as of december 31, 2023.
•throughout the portfolio, we currently have redevelopment projects underway with a projected total cost of approximately $321 million that we expect to stabilize over the next several years.
the above includes our best estimates based on information currently known, however, the completion of construction, final costs, and the timing of leasing and openings may be further impacted by the current environment including the duration and severity of the economic impacts of broader, as well as local, economic conditions, inflation, higher interest rates, and higher operating costs.
the development of future phases of assembly row, pike & rose, santana row, and other properties will be pursued opportunistically based on, among other things, market conditions, tenant demand, and our evaluation of whether those phases will generate an appropriate financial return.
we continue to review acquisition opportunities that complement our portfolio and provide long-term growth opportunities. initially, some of our acquisitions do not contribute significantly to earnings growth; however, we believe they provide long-term re-leasing growth, redevelopment opportunities, and other strategic opportunities. any growth from acquisitions is contingent on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles. changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property, as well as our ability to economically finance the property acquisition. generally, our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash and/or borrowings under our revolving credit facility which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new long-term debt. we may also finance our acquisitions through the issuance of common shares, preferred shares, or units in the operating partnership, as well as through assumed mortgages and property sales.
at december 31, 2023, the leasable commercial square feet in our properties was 94.2% leased and 92.2% occupied. the leased rate is higher than the occupied rate due to leased spaces that are being redeveloped or improved or that are awaiting permits and, therefore, are not yet ready to be occupied. our occupancy and leased rates are subject to variability over time due to factors including acquisitions, the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment projects, lease expirations and tenant closings and bankruptcies.
comparable properties throughout this section, we have provided certain information on a "comparable property" basis. information provided on a comparable property basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties that are currently under development or are being repositioned for significant redevelopment and investment. for the year ended december 31, 2023 and the comparison of 2023 and 2022, all or a portion of 94 properties, were considered comparable properties and eight were considered non-comparable properties. for the year ended december 31, 2023, one property was moved from comparable properties to non-comparable properties, four properties and one portion of a property were moved from acquisitions to comparable properties, and one property and one portion of a property were removed from comparable properties, as they were sold, compared to the designations as of december 31, 2022. while there is judgment surrounding changes in designations, we typically move non-comparable properties to comparable properties once they have stabilized, which is typically considered 90% physical occupancy or when the growth expected from the redevelopment has been included in the comparable periods. we typically remove properties from comparable properties when the repositioning of the asset has commenced and has or is expected to have a significant impact to property operating income within the calendar year. acquisitions are moved to comparable properties once we have owned the property for the entirety of comparable periods and the property is not under development or being repositioned for significant redevelopment and investment.

(1) property operating income is a non-gaap measure that consists of rental income and mortgage interest income, less rental expenses and real estate taxes. this measure is used internally to evaluate the performance of property operations to the previous period and we consider it be a significant measure. we believe that property operating income is useful to investors in measuring the operating performance of our property portfolio because the definition excludes various items included in operating income that do not relate to, or are not indicative of, the operating performance of our properties, such as general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization, and allows us to isolate disparities in operating income caused by acquisitions, dispositions, and stabilization of properties. property operating income may, therefore, provide a more consistent metric for comparing the operating performance of our real estate between periods. property operating income should not be considered an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with gaap. the reconciliation of operating income to property operating income for 2023 and 2022 is as follows:

property revenues total property revenue increased $57.8 million, or 5.4%, to $1.13 billion in 2023 compared to $1.07 billion in 2022. the percentage occupied at our shopping centers was 92.2% at december 31, 2023 compared to 92.8% at december 31, 2022. changes in the components of property revenue are discussed below.
rental income rental income consists primarily of minimum rent, cost reimbursements from tenants and percentage rent, and is net of collectibility related adjustments. rental income increased $57.7 million, or 5.4%, to $1.13 billion in 2023 compared to $1.07 billion in 2022 due primarily to the following:
•an increase of $25.4 million from 2022 and 2023 acquisitions,
•an increase of $23.3 million from comparable properties primarily related to higher rental rates of approximately $16.4 million, higher average occupancy of approximately $5.5 million, and a $5.1 million increase in recoveries from tenants, partially offset by a $2.9 million increase in collectibility related adjustments and a $2.7 million decrease in lease termination fee income,
•an increase of $19.2 million from non-comparable properties primarily driven by occupancy increases at assembly row phase iii, darien commons, pike & rose phases iii & iv, and cocowalk, partially offset by redevelopment related occupancy decreases at friendship center, and
•an increase of $2.8 million from higher demand at our pike & rose hotel, partially offset by
•a decrease of $13.0 million from property sales.
property expenses total property expenses increased $6.3 million, or 1.8%, to $363.1 million in 2023 compared to $356.8 million in 2022. changes in the components of property expenses are discussed below.
rental expenses rental expenses increased $2.7 million, or 1.2%, to $231.7 million in 2023 compared to $229.0 million in 2022. this increase is primarily due to the following:
•an increase of $4.4 million from 2022 and 2023 acquisitions,
•an increase of $1.6 million from comparable properties due primarily to higher repairs and maintenance costs and other operating costs driven by inflationary impacts, higher insurance costs and utilities, and an increase in management fees on higher revenues, partially offset by lower snow removal costs,
•an increase of $0.9 million from non-comparable properties driven by openings at darien commons, cocowalk, and assembly row phase iii, partially offset by lower costs associated with the redevelopment of huntington shopping center, and
•an increase of $0.7 million in operating expenses at our pike & rose hotel as a result of higher occupancy, partially offset by
•a decrease of $5.1 million from property sales.
as a result of the changes in rental income and rental expenses as discussed above, rental expenses as a percentage of rental income decreased to 20.5% for the year ended december 31, 2023 from 21.3% for the year ended december 31, 2022.
real estate taxes real estate tax expense increased $3.6 million, or 2.8% to $131.4 million in 2023 compared to $127.8 million in 2022 due primarily to the following:
•an increase of $4.1 million from 2022 and 2023 acquisitions, and
•an increase of $0.8 million from comparable properties due to higher assessments partially offset by successful tax appeals, partially offset by
•a decrease of $1.5 million from our property sales.
property operating income property operating income increased $51.5 million, or 7.2%, to $769.1 million in 2023 compared to $717.6 million in 2022. this increase is primarily driven by higher rental rates and occupancy, the 2022 and 2023 openings at our non-comparable properties, and 2022 and 2023 acquisitions, partially offset by property sales.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased $19.4 million, or 6.4%, to $321.8 million in 2023 from $302.4 million in 2022. this increase is due primarily to property acquisitions, our investment in comparable properties, placing redevelopment properties into service, and the reconsolidation of escondido promenade during the second quarter of 2023, partially offset by 2022 property sales.
gain on deconsolidation of vie the $70.4 million gain on deconsolidation of vie for the year ended december 31, 2022 is the result of the deconsolidation of escondido promenade during the third quarter of 2022 (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information).
gain on sale of real estate the $9.9 million gain on sale of real estate for the year ended december 31, 2023 is due primarily to the sale of one retail property and one portion of a property (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information).
the $93.5 million gain on sale of real estate for the year ended december 31, 2022 is due primarily to a net gain of $84.1 million from the sale of two residential properties (including an adjacent retail pad), one retail property, and one parcel of land (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information), and a $9.3 million gain related to the reduction of our liability for estimated condemnation and transaction costs associated with the sale under threat of condemnation in december 2019 at san antonio center.
operating income operating income decreased $119.9 million, or 22.8%, to $406.5 million in 2023 compared to $526.4 million in 2022. this decrease is primarily driven by lower gains on sale of real estate, the prior year gain on the deconsolidation of a vie, and property sales, partially offset by higher rental rates and occupancy, 2022 and 2023 acquisitions, and the 2022 and 2023 openings at our non-comparable properties.
other other interest income other interest income increased $3.6 million, or 337.2%, to $4.7 million in 2023 compared to $1.1 million in 2022. this increase is primarily driven by interest earned on the proceeds of our april 2023 senior unsecured note issuance until the june 1, 2023 payoff of our 2.75% senior unsecured notes and higher interest earned on cash balances.
interest expense interest expense increased $30.8 million, or 22.5%, to $167.8 million in 2023 compared to $137.0 million in 2022. this increase is due primarily to the following:
•an increase of $25.4 million due to a higher overall weighted average borrowing rate, and
•an increase of $9.3 million due to higher weighted average borrowings, partially offset by
•an increase of $3.9 million in capitalized interest.
gross interest costs were $190.4 million and $155.7 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. capitalized interest was $22.6 million and $18.7 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
income from partnerships income from partnerships decreased $1.3 million or 25.2% to $3.9 million in 2023 compared to $5.2 million in 2022. this decrease is primarily driven by lower income at our restaurant joint ventures largely attributable to higher forgiveness of certain loans in the prior year.

liquidity and capital resources due to the nature of our business and strategy, we typically generate significant amounts of cash from operations which is largely paid to our common and preferred shareholders in the form of dividends because as a reit, the trust is generally required to make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90% of our taxable income (cash dividends paid in 2023 were approximately $360.9 million). remaining cash flow from operations after regular debt service requirements (including debt service relating to additional or replacement debt, as well as scheduled debt maturities) and dividend payments is used to fund recurring and non-recurring capital projects (such as tenant improvements and redevelopments). we maintain an unsecured $1.25 billion revolving credit facility to fund short term cash flow needs and also look to the public and private debt and equity markets, joint venture relationships, and property dispositions to fund capital expenditures on a long-term basis.
on april 12, 2023, we issued $350.0 million of 5.375% senior unsecured notes, on december 28, 2023, we entered into a $200.0 million secured loan that bears interest at 5.03% through the initial maturity date, and on january 11, 2024, we issued $485.0 million of 3.25% exchangeable senior unsecured notes. we also raised $138.3 million from sales of common shares under our atm equity program. we repaid $275.0 million of 2.75% senior unsecured notes at maturity on june 1, 2023, repaid $600.0 million of 3.95% unsecured notes at maturity on january 16, 2024, and extended the maturity of our $600.0 million term loan to april 2025 (with an additional one year extension at our option still available to further extend the loan to april 2026). for the remainder of 2024, we have no additional debt maturing.
as of december 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $250.8 million and no balance outstanding on our $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. for the year ended 2023, the weighted average amount of borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility was $44.7 million, and the weighted average interest rate, before amortization of debt fees, was 5.9%. we also have the capacity to issue up to $312.1 million in common shares under the atm program.
our overall capital requirements during 2024 will be impacted by the overall economic environment including impacts of inflation, higher interest rates, and a potential recession, as well as acquisition opportunities and the level and general timing of our redevelopment and development activities. we currently have development and redevelopment projects in various stages of construction with remaining costs of $250 million. we expect to incur the majority of those costs in the next two years. we expect overall capital costs to be at levels slightly reduced from 2023 as we complete current redevelopment projects, prepare vacant space for new tenants, and complete the current phase and prepare for the next phase of our larger mixed use development projects.
we believe cash flow from operations, the cash on our balance sheet, and our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility will allow us to continue to operate our business in the short-term. given our ability to access the capital markets, we also expect debt or equity to be available to us, although newly issued debt would likely be at higher interest rates than we currently have outstanding. we also have the ability to delay the timing of certain development and redevelopment projects as well as limit future acquisitions, reduce our operating expenditures, or re-evaluate our dividend policy. we expect these sources of liquidity and opportunities for operating flexibility to allow us to meet our financial obligations over the long term. we intend to operate with and to maintain our long term commitment to a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixed-charge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investment-grade debt ratings.

net cash provided by operating activities increased $39.1 million to $555.8 million during 2023 from $516.8 million during 2022. the increase was primarily attributable to higher net income after adjusting for non-cash items and gains on sale of real estate, as well as higher collections related to year end recovery billings.
net cash used in investing activities decreased $427.7 million to $358.3 million during 2023 from $786.0 million during 2022. the decrease was primarily attributable to:
•a $377.9 million decrease in acquisition of real estate primarily due to the january 2023 huntington square acquisition and the acquisition of our partner's 22.3% tic interest in escondido promenade (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information), as compared to 2022 property acquisitions,
•a $105.6 million decrease in net capital expenditures,
•a $23.2 million decrease in investment in partnerships, resulting from the 2022 acquisition of a 47.5% net interest in an unconsolidated joint venture that owns two shopping centers (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information), and
•$16.7 million decrease in costs paid relating to the partial sale under threat of condemnation at san antonio center in 2019, partially offset by,
•a $105.3 million decrease in net proceeds from the sale of real estate primarily due to $28.5 million of net proceeds from the sale of one retail property and one portion of a property during 2023, as compared to $133.7 million of net proceeds from the sale of two residential properties (one included an adjacent retail pad), one retail property, one parcel of land, and one portion of a property during 2022.
net cash provided by financing activities decreased $224.3 million to $33.8 million used during 2023 from $190.4 million provided during 2022. the decrease was primarily attributable to:
•$298.6 million in net proceeds from our unsecured term loan in october 2022,
•$275.0 million from the june 2023 repayment of our $275.0 million 2.75% senior unsecured notes,
•a $175.4 million decrease in net proceeds from the issuance of common shares primarily related to issuances under our atm program for net proceeds of $131.7 million and $306.8 million, respectively, during 2023 and 2022,
•a $39.0 million increase in repayment of mortgages, finance leases, and notes payable primarily due to the october 2023 finance lease buyout for $55.0 million (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information), as compared to the $16.1 million mortgage loan repayment on one of the buildings at our hoboken property in june 2022, and
•an $11.9 million increase in dividends paid to common and preferred shareholders due to an increase in the number of outstanding shares, as well as an increase to the common share dividend rate, partially offset by,
•$345.7 million in net proceeds from the issuance of $350.0 million of 5.375% senior unsecured notes in april 2023,
•$199.2 million in net proceeds from the mortgage loan secured by our bethesda row property, which was entered into in december 2023, and
•a $23.3 million decrease in distributions to and redemptions of noncontrolling interests primarily related to the july 2022 acquisition of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in the partnership that owns the plaza el segundo shopping center for $23.6 million.

(1)on december 29, 2023, we entered into three interest rate swap agreements that fix the interest rate on the mortgage loan at a weighted average interest rate of 5.03% through the initial maturity date.
(2)on november 26, 2019, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements that fix the interest rate on the mortgage loan at 3.67%. the reference rate for the mortgage loan and related swaps was amended from libor to sofr in may 2023. the amendment was effective for interest payments subsequent to july 1, 2023.
(3)the interest rates on these mortgages range from 3.91% to 5.00%.
(4)on february 6, 2024, we extended the maturity date to april 16, 2025, with an additional one year extension at our option still available to further extend the loan to april 16, 2026.
(5)our revolving credit facility sofr loans bear interest at daily simple sofr or term sofr and our term loan bears interest at term sofr as defined in the respective credit agreements, plus 0.10%, plus a spread, based on our current credit rating.
(6)the maximum amount drawn under our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility during 2023 was $115.5 million and the weighted average effective interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility, before amortization of debt fees, was 5.9%.
(7)the operating partnership is the obligor under our revolving credit facility, term loan, and senior notes and debentures.
our revolving credit facility, unsecured term loan, and other debt agreements include financial and other covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future. as of december 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants related to our revolving credit facility, term loan, and senior notes. additionally, we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants that could trigger a loan default on our mortgage loans. if we were to breach any of these financial and other covenants and did not cure the breach within an applicable cure period, our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and, if the debt is secured, could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan. many of our debt arrangements, including our public notes and our revolving credit facility, are cross-defaulted, which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations. as a result, any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares. our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur.
the following is a summary of our scheduled principal repayments as of december 31, 2023:

(1)our $600.0 million term loan had an original maturity date of april 16, 2024. on february 6, 2024, we extended the term loan to april 16, 2025 with an additional one year extension at our option still available to further extend the loan to april 16, 2026.
(2)our $200.0 million mortgage loan secured by bethesda row matures on december 28, 2025 plus two one-year extensions, at our option to december 28, 2027.
(3)our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility matures on april 5, 2027, plus two six-month extensions at our option to april 5, 2028. as of december 31, 2023, there was no outstanding balance under this credit facility.
(4)the total debt maturities differ from the total reported on the consolidated balance sheet due to the unamortized net debt issuance costs and premium/discount on mortgage loans, notes payable, and senior notes as of december 31, 2023.
interest rate hedging we may use derivative instruments to manage exposure to variable interest rate risk. we generally enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt. we enter into derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges and do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
interest rate swaps associated with cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. effectiveness of cash flow hedges is assessed both at inception and on an ongoing basis. the effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income which is included in "accumulated other comprehensive income" on the balance sheets, statement of shareholders' equity, and statement of capital. cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not perfectly match such as notional amounts, settlement dates, reset dates, calculation period and sofr rate. in addition, the default risk of the counterparty is evaluated by monitoring the credit worthiness of the counterparty which includes reviewing debt ratings and financial performance. if a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective, the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected.
as of december 31, 2023, we have two interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest rate on a mortgage payable associated with our hoboken portfolio at 3.67% and we have three interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest rate on a mortgage payable associated with bethesda row at 5.03% through the initial maturity date. our assembly row hotel joint venture is also a party to two interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix 100% of its outstanding $39.0 million of debt through may 2025 at 6.39% and 50% of its outstanding debt from june 2025 through may 2028 at 6.03%. all swaps were designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. hedge ineffectiveness has not impacted our earnings in 2023, 2022 and 2021.
reit qualification we intend to maintain our qualification as a reit under section 856(c) of the code. as a reit, we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes on income we distribute to our shareholders as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the code, including the requirement to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our shareholders.
funds from operations funds from operations ("ffo") is a supplemental non-gaap financial measure of real estate companies' operating performance. the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") defines ffo as follows: net income, computed in accordance with u.s. gaap, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and excluding gains and losses on the sale of real estate or changes in control, net of tax, and impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. we compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition, and we have historically reported our ffo available for common shareholders in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities. it should be noted that ffo:
•does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap (which, unlike ffo, generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income);
•should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance; and
•is not necessarily indicative of cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to fund cash needs, including the payment of dividends.
we consider ffo available for common shareholders a meaningful, additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as implied by the historical cost convention of gaap and the recording of depreciation. we use ffo primarily as one of several means of assessing our operating performance in comparison with other reits. comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits.
an increase or decrease in ffo available for common shareholders does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in aggregate distributions because our board of trustees is not required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis. however, we must distribute at least 90% of our annual taxable income to remain qualified as a reit. therefore, a significant increase in ffo will generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis.
the reconciliation of net income to ffo available for common shareholders is as follows:

(1)for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, dividends on our series 1 preferred stock were not deducted in the calculation of ffo available to common shareholders, as the related shares were dilutive and included in "weighted average number of common shares, diluted."
(2)the weighted average common shares used to compute ffo per diluted common share includes downreit operating partnership units that were excluded from the computation of diluted eps. conversion of these operating partnership units is dilutive in the computation of ffo per diluted common share but is anti-dilutive for the computation of diluted eps for 2023 and 2021.

item 1a. risk factors in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10-k, you should carefully consider the following factors which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or stock price. the risks below are not the only risks we face. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price.
risks relating to our business and operations we face strong competition. our failure to successfully develop and market new products could adversely affect our business.
the medical device industry is highly competitive. we compete with many domestic and foreign medical device companies ranging from small start-up enterprises that might sell only a single or limited number of competitive products or compete only in a specific market segment, to companies that are larger and more established than us, have a broad range of competitive products, participate in numerous markets and have access to significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do. we also face competition from providers of alternative medical therapies, such as pharmaceutical companies.
in addition, the medical device industry is characterized by extensive product research and development and rapid technological advances. the future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to design and manufacture new products and enhance existing products. our product development efforts may require us to make substantial investments. there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop new products, enhance existing products or achieve market acceptance of our products, due to, among other things, our inability to:
•identify viable new products;
•maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our investments in research and development and product acquisitions;
•obtain adequate intellectual property protection;
•gain market acceptance of new products; or
•successfully obtain regulatory approvals.
in addition, our competitors currently may be developing, or may develop in the future, products that provide better features, clinical outcomes or economic value than those that we currently offer or subsequently develop. our failure to successfully develop and market new products or enhance existing products, and to compete successfully with others in the medical device industry, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our customers depend on third party coverage and reimbursements, and the failure of healthcare programs to provide sufficient coverage and reimbursement for our medical products could adversely affect us.
the ability of our customers to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our products is important to our business. demand for many of our existing and new medical products is, and will continue to be, affected by the extent to which government healthcare programs and private health insurers reimburse our customers for patients' medical expenses in the countries where we do business. even when we develop or acquire a promising new product, demand for the product may be limited unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and government third party payors. internationally, healthcare reimbursement systems vary significantly. in some countries, medical centers are constrained by fixed budgets, regardless of the volume and nature of patient treatment. other countries require application for, and approval of, government or third party reimbursement. without both favorable coverage determinations by, and the financial support of, government and third party insurers, the market for many of our medical products would be adversely affected. in this regard, we cannot be sure that third party payors will maintain the current level of coverage and reimbursement to our customers for use of our existing products. adverse coverage determinations, including reductions in the amount of reimbursement, could harm our business by discouraging customers' selection of, and reducing the prices they are willing to pay for, our products.
in addition, as a result of their purchasing power, third party payors have implemented and are continuing to implement cost cutting measures such as seeking discounts, price reductions or other incentives from medical products suppliers and imposing limitations on coverage and reimbursement for medical technologies and procedures. these trends could compel us to reduce prices for our products and could cause a decrease in the size of the market or a potential increase in competition that could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we are subject to extensive government regulation, which may require us to incur significant expenses to ensure compliance. our failure to comply with those regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
our products are medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the u.s. by the fda and by comparable government agencies in other countries. the regulations govern, among other things, the development, design, clinical testing, premarket clearance and approval, manufacturing, labeling, importing and exporting and sale and marketing of many of our products. moreover, these regulations are subject to future change.
in the u.s., before we can market a new medical device, or a new use of, or claim for, or significant modification to, an existing product, we generally must first receive either 510(k) clearance or de novo authorization or approval of a premarket approval application, or pma, from the fda. similarly, most major markets for medical devices outside the u.s. also require clearance, approval, authorization or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed. in the eu, the eu mdr went into effect in may 2021 and includes significant additional pre- and post-market requirements. the process of obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device, particularly from the fda and certain foreign government authorities, can be costly and time consuming, and clearances and approvals might not be granted for new products on a timely basis, if at all. in addition, once a device has been cleared or approved, a new clearance or approval may be required before the device may be modified or its labeling changed. furthermore, the fda or a foreign government authority may make its review and clearance or approval process more rigorous, which could require us to generate additional clinical or other data, and expend more time and effort, in obtaining future product clearances or approvals. the regulatory clearance and approval process may result in, among other things, delayed realization of product revenues, substantial additional costs or limitations on indicated uses of products, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. even after a product has received marketing approval or clearance, such product approval or clearance can be withdrawn or limited due to unforeseen problems with the device or issues relating to its application, or the fda or a foreign government authority may change the classification of a product, which could require additional clinical studies and new marketing submissions.
failure to comply with applicable regulations could lead to adverse effects on our business, which could include:
•partial suspension or total shutdown of manufacturing;
•product shortages;
•delays in product manufacturing;
•warning or untitled letters;
•fines or civil penalties;
•delays in or restrictions on obtaining new regulatory clearances or approvals;
•withdrawal or suspension of required clearances, approvals or licenses;
•product seizures or recalls;
•injunctions;
•criminal prosecution;
•advisories or other field actions;
•operating restrictions; and
•prohibitions against exporting of products to, or importing products from, countries outside the u.s.
we could be required to expend significant financial and human resources to remediate failures to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines. in addition, civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion under medicaid or medicare, could result from certain regulatory violations. any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
medical devices are cleared or approved for one or more specific intended uses and performance claims must be adequately substantiated. promoting a device for a use outside of the cleared or approved intended use or population, that is, an off-label use, or making false, misleading or unsubstantiated claims could result in government enforcement action.
furthermore, our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and other federal, state and foreign government authorities, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including the fda's qsr, which requires, among other things, periodic audits, design controls, quality control testing and documentation procedures, as well as complaint evaluations and investigation. in addition, any facilities assembling kits that include drug components and are registered as drug repackaging establishments are also subject to current good manufacturing practices requirements for drugs. the fda also requires the reporting of certain adverse events and product malfunctions and requires the reporting of certain recalls or other field safety corrective actions for medical devices. issues identified through such inspections and reports may result in fda enforcement action through any of the actions discussed above. moreover, issues identified through such inspections and reports may require significant resources to resolve.
we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws, regulation and enforcement; our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the governments of those states and foreign countries in which we conduct our business. the laws that may affect our ability to operate include:
•the federal healthcare anti-kickback statute, which, among other things, prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully offering or paying remuneration, one purpose of which is to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid, or soliciting payment for such referrals, purchases, orders and recommendations;
•federal false claims laws which, among other things, prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment from the federal government, including medicare, medicaid or other third-party payors;
•the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ("hipaa"), which prohibits schemes to defraud any healthcare benefit program and false statements relating to healthcare matters; and
•state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
if our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other government regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment of personnel, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. the risk of our being found to have violated these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations.
further, the affordable care act, through the physician payments sunshine act, imposes annual reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any "transfer of value" made or distributed to physicians or teaching hospitals, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists (including anesthesiology assistants) and certified nurse-midwives. the reported information is made publicly available in a searchable format. in addition, device manufacturers are required to report and disclose any ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for each payment, transfer of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission, up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for "knowing failures").
there are also certain states, including connecticut, massachusetts, and vermont, that require device manufacturers to track and report payments or transfers of value provided to certain health care providers and health care entities. in addition, some states, such as california, connecticut, nevada and massachusetts, mandate implementation of compliance programs that include restrictions on certain interactions and items of value that may be provided to health care providers, as well as the tracking and reporting of certain items of value, compensation for consulting and other services, and other remuneration to healthcare providers. further, we are subject to a law in vermont that imposes a ban on providing certain items of value and payments to health care providers. the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with the different compliance and/or reporting requirements among a number of jurisdictions increases the possibility that we may inadvertently violate one or more of the requirements, resulting in increased compliance costs that could adversely impact our results of operations.
we may not be successful in achieving expected operating efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense reductions, and may experience business disruptions associated with restructuring, facility consolidations, realignment, cost reduction and other strategic initiatives.
over the past several years we have implemented a number of restructuring, realignment and cost reduction initiatives, including facility consolidations, organizational realignments and reductions in our workforce, and we may engage in similar efforts in the future. while we have realized some efficiencies from these initiatives, we may not realize the benefits of these or future initiatives to the extent we anticipated. further, such benefits may be realized later than expected, and the ongoing difficulties in implementing these measures may be greater than anticipated, which could cause us to incur additional costs or result in business disruptions. in addition, if these measures are not successful or sustainable, we may be compelled to undertake additional restructuring, realignment and cost reduction efforts, which could result in significant additional charges. moreover, if our restructuring, realignment and cost reduction efforts prove ineffective, our ability to achieve our strategic and business plan goals may be adversely affected.
as part of our efforts to increase operating efficiencies, we have implemented a number of initiatives over the past several years to consolidate our enterprise resource planning, or erp, systems. in addition, we currently are in the early stages of a multi-year phased conversion to upgrade our global erp system to mitigate the risks associated with our vendor's planned end of support for the current version of our existing erp system. this conversion will represent a substantial undertaking and require the investment of significant personnel and financial resources. to date, we have not experienced any significant disruptions to our business or operations in connection with these initiatives. however, as we continue our efforts to upgrade and further consolidate our erp systems, we could experience business disruptions, which could adversely affect customer relationships and divert the attention of management away from daily operations. in addition, any delays in the implementation of these initiatives could cause us to incur additional unexpected costs. should we experience such difficulties, our business, cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected.
disruptions in sterilization of our products or regulatory initiatives further restricting the use of ethylene oxide in sterilization facilities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
many of our products require sterilization prior to sale. a common method for sterilizing medical products involves the use of ethylene oxide, which is listed as a hazardous air pollutant under the clean air act, as amended, and emissions of which are regulated by the u.s. environmental protection agency ("epa") and other regulatory authorities. companies in the sterilization industry may face private litigation that could result in financial difficulties that could ultimately make it difficult or undesirable for such companies to continue in the sterilization business. in addition, sterilization activities are subject to substantial governmental oversight and attention that could disrupt their operations. one of our contract sterilizers, sterigenics u.s., llc, uses ethylene oxide in its sterilization process, including at its facilities in smyrna, cobb county, georgia and santa teresa, new mexico, which have sterilized some of our vascular, surgical, intermittent catheter and oem products. in recent years, sterigenics' operations at both its smyrna and santa teresa facilities have been subject to legal proceedings related to the facilities' use of ethylene oxide in their sterilization operations. while both plants are currently operating normally, should their operations be suspended or adversely affected, our ability to provide affected products to our customers could be impaired if we are unable to utilize alternate facilities and sources for sterilization services.
in addition, in 2019, the attorneys general of 15 states and the district of columbia sent a letter to the epa urging that the epa promptly propose and finalize stricter standards for ethylene oxide emissions. subsequently, the epa solicited information and comments from the public on proposed revisions to regulations regarding ethylene oxide emissions and collected information from commercial sterilizers about ethylene oxide sterilization processes and emissions. in april 2023, the epa released a proposed rule under the clean air act that would require commercial sterilizers to install pollution control equipment to reduce ethylene oxide emissions and implement methods to continuously monitor emissions and report results to the epa. according to the terms of an august 2023 consent decree entered by the u.s. district court for the district of columbia, the epa must issue the final rule by march 1, 2024, and contract sterilizers are anticipated to have 18 months to come into compliance. failure of our contract sterilizers to achieve compliance with the final rule by the deadline would significantly impair our ability to provide sufficient quantities of sterilized products to our customers and compel us to seek sterilization alternatives that do not entail the use of ethylene oxide. we cannot assure that we would be able to identify such alternatives. in the event we were to experience any disruptions in our ability to sterilize our products, whether due to capacity constraints or regulatory or other impediments (including, among other things, regulatory initiatives directed generally to sterilization facilities that utilize ethylene oxide), or we are unable to transition to alternative facilities in a timely or cost effective manner in the event one or more of the facilities we use is affected, we could experience a material adverse impact with respect to our results of operations and financial condition.
a significant portion of our u.s. revenues is derived from sales to distributors, and "destocking" activity by these distributors can adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.
a significant portion of our revenues in the u.s. is derived from sales to distributors, which, in turn, sell our products to hospitals and other health care institutions. from time to time, these distributors may decide to reduce their levels of inventory with regard to certain of our products, a practice we refer to as "destocking." a distributor's decision to reduce inventory levels with respect to our products may be based on a number of factors, such as distributor expectations regarding demand for a particular product, distributor buying decisions (including decisions to purchase competing products), changes in distributor policies regarding the maintenance of inventory levels, economic conditions and other factors. following such instances of reduced purchases, distributors may revert to previous purchasing levels; nevertheless, we cannot assure that distributors will, in fact, increase purchases of our products in this manner. a decline in the level of product purchases by our u.s. distributors in the future could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations during a reporting period, and an extended decline in such product purchases could have a longer term material adverse effect.
we may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty claims, as well as product recalls, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. furthermore, our reputation as a medical device company may be damaged if one or more of our products are, or are alleged to be, defective.
our businesses expose us to potential product liability risks related to the design, manufacture, labeling and marketing of our products. in particular, our medical device products are often used in surgical and intensive care settings for procedures involving seriously ill patients. in addition, many of our products are designed to be implanted in the human body for varying periods of time. product defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks with respect to products we manufacture or sell could result in patient injury or death. product liability and warranty claims often involve very large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive damages. the magnitude of potential losses from product liability lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time, and the related legal defense costs may be significant. we could experience material warranty or product liability losses in the future and incur significant costs to defend these claims.
in addition, if any of our products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may voluntarily conduct, or be required by regulatory authorities to conduct, a recall of that product. in the event of a recall, we may lose sales and be exposed to individual or class-action litigation claims. moreover, negative publicity regarding a quality or safety issue, whether accurate or inaccurate, could harm our reputation, decrease demand for our products, lead to product withdrawals or impair our ability to successfully launch and market our products in the future. product liability, warranty and recall costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
volatility in domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
we are subject to risks arising from adverse changes in general domestic and global economic conditions. the economic slowdown and disruption of credit markets that occurred several years ago led to recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending, resulting in reductions, delays or cancellations of purchases of our products and services. we cannot predict the duration or extent of any economic recovery or the extent to which our customers will return to more typical spending behaviors. the continuation in a number of markets of weak economic growth, constricted credit, public sector austerity measures in response to public budget deficits and foreign currency volatility, particularly with respect to the euro, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments, we cannot assure that the loss rate will not increase in the future given the volatility in the worldwide economy. if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible, we would be required to incur additional charges, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. moreover, our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations.
in addition, adverse economic and financial market conditions may result in future impairment charges with respect to our goodwill and other intangible assets, which would not directly affect our liquidity but could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.
our strategic initiatives, including acquisitions, may not produce the intended growth in revenue and operating income, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
our strategic initiatives include making significant investments designed to achieve revenue growth and to enable us to meet or exceed margin improvement targets. if we do not achieve the expected benefits from these investments or otherwise fail to execute on our strategic initiatives, we may not achieve the growth improvement we are targeting, and our results of operations may be adversely affected.
in addition, as part of our strategy for growth, we have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions and divestitures and enter into strategic alliances such as joint ventures and joint development agreements. however, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully, and our joint ventures or strategic alliances may not prove to be successful. in this regard, acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the integration of acquired operations, technologies, services and products and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. moreover, the products and technologies that we acquire may not be successful or may require us to devote significantly greater development, marketing and other resources, as well as significantly greater investments, than we anticipated. we could also experience negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition from acquisition-related charges, amortization of intangible assets, asset impairment charges and other matters that could arise in connection with the acquisition of a company or business, including matters related to internal control over financial reporting and regulatory compliance, as well as the short-term effects of increased costs on results of operations. although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there can be no assurance that we will identify all such risks or the magnitude of the risks. in addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and expenditures. future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. there can be no assurance that difficulties encountered in connection with acquisitions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in connection with certain of our completed acquisitions, we have agreed to pay consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified objectives, such as receipt of regulatory approval, commercialization of a product or achievement of sales targets. as of the acquisition date, we record a contingent liability representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay. on a quarterly basis, we reassess these obligations and, in the event our estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration changes, we record increases or decreases in the fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings, which could have a material impact on our results of operations. as of december 31, 2023, we accrued $39.5 million of contingent consideration related to completed business combinations, most of which related to standard bariatrics inc. and palette. in addition, actual payments may differ materially from the amount of the contingent liability, which could have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. for information regarding assumptions related to our contingent consideration liabilities, see "critical accounting policies and estimates" under item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10-k. for additional information regarding our acquisitions, see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by public health epidemics or pandemics, as occurred with respect to the recent covid-19 epidemic and pandemic.
we are subject to risks associated with public health threats, such as the recent covid-19 epidemic and pandemic. as with covid-19, such events could significantly impact economic activity and markets around the world and, as a result, have negative effects on our operations, financial performance and cash flows. such effects would depend on various factors, including, but not limited, to: the occurrence, spread, duration and severity of any outbreaks; governmental, business and individuals' actions that may be taken in response to an epidemic or pandemic (including restrictions on travel, transport and workforce pressures, and deferrals or postponements of elective procedures); the impact of such a crisis, and actions taken in response thereto, on global and regional economies, travel and economic activity; the availability of federal, state, local or non-u.s. funding programs; general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; and the timing and pace of recovery as such a crisis subsides, which could be impacted by a number of factors, including limited provider capacity to perform procedures using our products that were deferred as a result of the epidemic or pandemic.
these and other impacts of epidemics or pandemics could have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein. we might not be able to predict or respond to all impacts on a timely basis to prevent near- or long-term adverse impacts to our results. however, these effects could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, capital resources, operations and business and those of the third parties on which we rely, and such impact could be material.
health care reform may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our business.
political, economic and regulatory developments have effected fundamental changes in the healthcare industry. the affordable care act substantially changed the way health care is financed by both government and private insurers. it also encourages improvements in the quality of health care products and services and significantly impacts the u.s. pharmaceutical and medical device industries. among other things, the affordable care act:
•established a new patient-centered outcomes research institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research;
•implemented payment system reforms, including a national pilot program to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain health care services through bundled payment models; and
•created an independent payment advisory board that will submit recommendations to reduce medicare spending if projected medicare spending exceeds a specified growth rate.
we cannot predict at this time the full impact of the affordable care act or other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. in this regard, several legislative initiatives to repeal and replace the affordable care act were proposed, but not adopted in 2017. however, u.s. tax legislation adopted in december 2017 and commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act ("tcja") eliminated the individual mandate under the affordable care act, which has resulted in increased uncertainty regarding insurance premium prices for participants in insurance exchanges under the act, and may have other effects. while several recent legal challenges to the affordable care act have been unsuccessful, further challenges may be mounted in the future. the nature and effect of any modification or repeal of, or legislative substitution for, the affordable care act, or any court decision regarding the act's validity, is uncertain, and we cannot predict the effect that any of these events would have on the longer-term viability of the act, or on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
we are subject to risks associated with our non-u.s. operations.
we have significant manufacturing and distribution facilities, research and development facilities, sales personnel and customer support operations in a number of countries outside the u.s., including belgium, the czech republic, ireland, malaysia and mexico. in addition, a significant portion of our non-u.s. revenues are derived from sales to third party distributors. as of december 31, 2023, 72% of our full-time employees were employed in countries outside of the u.s., and 58% of our net property, plant and equipment was located outside the u.s. in addition, for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, 37%, 36% and 37%, respectively, of our net revenues (based on the teleflex entity generating the sale) were derived from operations outside the u.s.
our international operations are subject to risks inherent in doing business outside the u.s., including:
•exchange controls, currency restrictions and fluctuations in currency values;
•trade protection measures, tariffs and other duties, especially in light of trade disputes between the u.s. and several foreign countries, including china;
•potentially costly and burdensome import or export requirements;
•laws and business practices that favor local companies;
•changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and procedures;
•subsidies or increased access to capital for firms that currently are or may emerge as competitors in countries in which we have operations;
•substantial non-u.s. tax liabilities, including potentially negative consequences resulting from changes in tax laws;
•restrictions and taxes related to the repatriation of non-u.s. earnings;
•differing labor regulations;
•additional u.s. and foreign government controls or regulations;
•the impact of the united kingdom's departure from the european union, commonly referred to as "brexit";
•public health epidemics;
•difficulties in the protection of intellectual property; and
•unsettled political and economic conditions and possible terrorist attacks against american interests.
in addition, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (the "fcpa") prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-u.s. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. similar anti-bribery laws are in effect in several foreign jurisdictions. the fcpa also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded u.s. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which, among other things, are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments to government officials, and to prevent the establishment of "off the books" slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. because of the predominance of government-sponsored health care systems around the world, many of our customer relationships outside of the u.s. are with government entities and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws. our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. however, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree. despite meaningful measures that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct, which include training and compliance programs and internal control policies and procedures, we may not always prevent reckless or criminal acts by our employees, distributors or other agents. in addition, we may be exposed to liability due to pre-acquisition conduct of employees, distributors or other agents of businesses or operations we acquire. violations of anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we also could be subject to severe penalties and other adverse consequences, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, substantial expenditures related to further enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, personnel changes and other remedial actions, as well as harm to our reputation.
furthermore, we are subject to the export controls and economic embargo rules and regulations of the u.s., including the export administration regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries, which are administered by the office of foreign assets control within the department of the treasury, as well as other laws and regulations administered by the department of commerce. these regulations limit our ability to market, sell, distribute or otherwise transfer our products or technology to prohibited countries or persons. while we train our employees and contractually obligate our distributors to comply with these regulations, we cannot assure that a violation will not occur, whether knowingly or inadvertently. failure to comply with these rules and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines and the disgorgement of profits, the imposition of a court-appointed monitor, the denial of export privileges and debarment from participation in u.s. government contracts, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
additionally, in connection with the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine, the u.s. government has imposed enhanced export controls on certain products and sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in russia. although our sales into russia did not constitute a material portion of our total revenue in 2023, further escalation of geopolitical tensions, including as a result of the imposition of additional economic sanctions, could have a broader impact that expands into other markets where we do business, which could adversely affect our business and/or our supply chain, business partners or customers in the broader region.
foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results.
we are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. products manufactured in, and sold into, foreign markets represent a significant portion of our operations. our consolidated financial statements reflect translation of financial statements denominated in non-u.s. currencies to u.s. dollars, our reporting currency, as well as the foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities and from transactions denominated in currencies other than the primary currency of the country in which the entity operates, which we refer to as "non-functional currencies." a strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which we sell or manufacture our products, such as the euro, will affect our u.s. dollar-reported revenue and income. although we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of our monetary assets and liabilities and projected cash flows denominated in non-functional currencies in order to reduce the effects of currency rate fluctuations, changes in the relative values of currencies may, in some instances, have a significant effect on our results of operations.
many of our products have significant plastic resin content. we also use quantities of other commodities, such as aluminum and steel. increases in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services. we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers, particularly with respect to those products we sell under group purchase agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.
increases in interest rates may adversely affect the financial health of our customers and suppliers, thereby adversely affecting their ability to buy our products and supply the components or raw materials we need. in addition, our borrowing costs have been adversely affected by recent interest rate increases and could be further affected if interest rates continue to increase. any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
fluctuations in our effective tax rate and changes to tax laws may adversely affect us.
as a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate. in preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of these jurisdictions. our effective tax rate may, however, differ from the estimated amount due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country. further, many countries continue to consider changes in their tax laws by implementing new initiatives such as the organization for economic co-operation and development's pillar two global minimum tax, which will likely impact the amount of taxes that multinational companies such as teleflex pay in the future. various countries have already enacted or are in the process of incorporating the pillar two framework within their tax laws. while we continue to monitor these changes and their potential implications, the aggressive nature of the timeline set by the oecd for adoption of this framework, the lack of detailed guidance provided to date and the complexities surrounding its implementation may mean that all implications for business may not have been fully analyzed or understood before rules are finalized. any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
an interruption in our manufacturing or distribution operations or our supply of raw materials may adversely affect our business.
many of our key products are manufactured at or distributed from single locations, and the availability of alternate facilities is limited. if operations at one or more of our facilities is suspended due to natural disasters or other events, including, without limitation, those due to climate change, we may not be able to timely manufacture or distribute one or more of our products at previous levels or at all. furthermore, our ability to establish replacement facilities or to substitute suppliers may be delayed due to regulations and requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products. in addition, in the event of delays or cancellations in shipments of raw materials by our suppliers, we may not be able to timely manufacture or supply the affected products at previous levels or at all. the manufacture of our products is highly exacting and complex, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. problems in the manufacturing process, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, defective raw materials and environmental factors, could lead to delays in product releases, product shortages, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation. a failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in quality or safety issues. a reduction or interruption in manufacturing or distribution, or our inability to secure suitable alternative sources of raw materials or components or finished goods used in our kits, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
our ability to attract, train, develop and retain key employees is important to our success.
our success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to retain key personnel, including our executive officers and other members of our senior management team. our success also depends, in part, on our ability to attract, train, develop and retain other key employees, including research and development, sales, marketing and operations personnel. we may experience difficulties in retaining executives and other employees due to many factors, including:
•the intense competition for skilled personnel in our industry;
•fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions;
•changes in our organizational structure;
•our restructuring initiatives;
•competitors' hiring practices; and
•the effectiveness of our compensation programs.
our inability to attract, train, develop and retain such personnel could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
our failure to maintain strong relationships with physicians and other health care professionals could adversely affect us.
we depend on our ability to maintain strong working relationships with physicians and other healthcare professionals in connection with research and development for some of our products. we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and advice regarding the development and use of these products. physicians assist us as researchers, product consultants, inventors and public speakers. if we fail to maintain our working relationships with physicians and, as a result, no longer have the benefit of their knowledge and advice, our products may not be developed in a manner that is responsive to the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our technology is important to our success, and our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could put us at a competitive disadvantage.
we rely on the patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the u.s. and other countries to protect our proprietary rights. although we own numerous u.s. and foreign patents and have submitted numerous patent applications, we cannot be assured that any pending patent applications will issue, or that any patents, issued or pending, will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by third parties. in addition, we rely on confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with employees and take other measures to protect our know-how and trade secrets. the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology by competitors or other persons who may copy or otherwise obtain and use these products or technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as in the u.s. we cannot assure that current and former employees, contractors and other parties will not breach their confidentiality agreements with us, misappropriate proprietary information, copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. our inability to protect our proprietary technology could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. moreover, there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop know-how and trade secrets comparable to ours or develop better technology than our own, which could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed.
our products or processes may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to pay unexpected litigation costs or damages or prevent us from selling our products.
we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties. any such claims, whether or not meritorious, could result in litigation and divert the efforts of our personnel. if we are found liable for infringement, we may be compelled to enter into licensing agreements (which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all) or to pay damages or cease making or selling certain products. we may need to redesign some of our products or processes to avoid future infringement liability. any of the foregoing events could be detrimental to our business.
other pending and future litigation may involve significant costs and adversely affect our business.
we are party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business involving, among other things, contracts, intellectual property, import and export regulations, and employment and environmental matters. the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management's attention and may involve significant legal expenses. in addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. while we do not believe that any litigation in which we are currently engaged would have such an adverse effect, the outcome of litigation, including regulatory matters, is often difficult to predict, and we cannot assure that the outcome of pending or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
disruption of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of our systems may adversely affect our business and customer relationships.
we rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. we also rely on our technology infrastructure, among other functions, to enable us to interact with customers and suppliers, fulfill orders, generate invoices, collect and make payments, ship products, provide support to customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise perform business functions. our internal information technology systems, as well as those systems maintained by third-party providers, may be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, and cyber-attacks, any of which could result in data leaks or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, and in some cases have caused significant harm. although we have taken numerous measures to protect our information systems and enhance data security, we cannot assure that these measures will prevent security breaches that could have a significant impact on our business, reputation and financial results. if we fail to monitor, maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity effectively or fail to anticipate, plan for or manage significant disruptions to these systems, we could, among other things, lose customers, have difficulty preventing fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals, be subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties, incur expenses, lose revenues or suffer other adverse consequences. any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental and health and safety liabilities.
we are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing, among other things:
•the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials;
•emissions or discharges of substances into the environment;
•the impacts of industrial operations on climate change; and
•the health and safety of our employees.
these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws, or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances, which may include claims for personal injury or cleanup, will not exceed our estimates or will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
the effects of climate change or legal, regulatory or market measures intended to address climate change could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
risks associated with climate change are subject to increasing societal, regulatory and political focus in the u.s. and globally. while the effects of climate change in the near- and long-term are difficult to predict, shifts in weather patterns caused by climate change are expected to increase the frequency, severity and duration of certain adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires, droughts, extreme temperatures or flooding, which could cause more significant business and supply chain interruptions, damage to our products and facilities as well as the infrastructure of hospitals, medical care facilities and other customers, reduced workforce availability, increased costs of raw materials and components, increased liabilities, and decreased revenues than what we have experienced in the past from such events. in addition, increased public concern over climate change could result in new legal or regulatory requirements designed to mitigate the effects of climate change, which could include the adoption of more stringent environmental laws and regulations or stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, which could result in increased compliance burdens and costs to meet the regulatory obligations as well as adverse impacts on raw material sourcing, manufacturing operations and the distribution of our products. any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
our workforce covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements could cause interruptions in our provision of products and services.
as of december 31, 2023, 6% of our employees in the u.s. and in other countries were covered by union contracts or collective bargaining arrangements. it is likely that a portion of our workforce will remain covered by collective bargaining and similar agreements for the foreseeable future. strikes or work stoppages could occur that would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and our ability to conduct our business.
risks relating to our financing arrangements our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
as of december 31, 2023, we had total consolidated indebtedness of $1.8 billion.
our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to satisfy our debt obligations. it could also have significant effects on our business. for example, it could:
•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate expenditures;
•limit our ability to borrow additional funds for general corporate purposes;
•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;
•restrict us from pursuing business opportunities; and
•place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness.
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness when due or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be forced to:
•refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness;
•sell assets;
•reduce or delay capital expenditures; or
•seek to raise additional capital.
we may not be able to effect any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our financial condition at the time, the restrictions in the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness and other factors, including market conditions.
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our debt agreements impose restrictions on our business, which could prevent us from pursuing business opportunities and taking other desirable corporate actions, and may adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations.
our senior credit agreement and the indentures governing our 4.625% senior notes due 2027 (the "2027 notes") and our 4.25% senior notes due 2028 (the "2028 notes" and, together with the 2027 notes, the "senior notes") contain covenants that, among other things, impose significant restrictions on our business. the restrictions that these covenants place on us and our restricted subsidiaries collectively include limitations on our and their ability to, among other things:
•incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock or otherwise disqualified stock;
•create liens;
•pay dividends, make investments or make other restricted payments;
•sell assets;
•merge, consolidate, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and
•enter into transactions with our affiliates.
in addition, our senior credit agreement also contains financial covenants, including covenants requiring maintenance of a consolidated leverage ratio, a secured leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio, calculated in accordance with the terms of the senior credit agreement. a breach of any covenants under any one or more of our debt agreements could result in a default, which if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt. in addition, any debt agreements we enter into in the future may further limit our ability to enter into certain types of transactions.
under our cross-currency swap agreements, a meaningful decline in the u.s. dollar to euro exchange rate could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows.
in 2019 and 2023, we entered into cross-currency swap agreements with several financial institutions to hedge against the effect of variability in the u.s. dollar to euro exchange rate; the 2023 swap agreements were entered into following the maturation in october 2023 of cross-currency swap agreements we entered into in 2018. the swap agreements require an exchange of the notional amounts between us and the counterparties upon expiration or earlier termination of the agreements. if, at the expiration or earlier termination of the swap agreements, the u.s. dollar to euro exchange rate has declined from the rate in effect on the execution date, we are required to pay the counterparties an amount equal to the excess of the u.s. dollar value over the euro principal amount (we and the counterparties have agreed to a net settlement with regard to the exchange of the notional amounts at the date of expiration or earlier termination of the agreements). in the event of a significant decline in the u.s. dollar to euro exchange rate, our payment obligations to the counterparties could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows. in this regard, if, at the expiration or earlier termination of our swap agreements, the u.s. dollar to euro exchange rate has declined by 10% from the rate in effect at the inception of our agreements, we would be required to pay approximately $75 million to the counterparties in respect of the notional settlement. to the extent we enter into additional cross-currency swap agreements, a decline in the relevant exchange rates could further adversely affect our cash flows.
risks relating to ownership of our common stock we may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.
we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible into our common stock. as of december 31, 2023, we had outstanding approximately 47.0 million shares of our common stock, options to purchase 1.3 million shares of our common stock (of which approximately 1.0 million were vested as of that date), restricted stock units covering 0.2 million shares of our common stock (which are expected to vest over the next three years), performance stock units covering a maximum of 85,772 shares of our common stock (which are expected to vest over the next three years and depend on our performance with regard to specified financial measures and market performance of our common stock compared to designated public companies) and 120 shares of our common stock to be distributed from our deferred compensation plan. as of december 31, 2023, 3.9 million shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options. we cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock.
if we issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into our common stock, such issuances may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock. furthermore, our issuance of shares upon the exercise of some or all of the outstanding stock options, as well as the vesting of restricted stock units and some or all of the performance stock units will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders, and the subsequent sale in the public market of such shares of our common stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.
we may not pay dividends on our common stock in the future.
holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, requirements under covenants in our debt instruments, legal requirements and other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. we cannot assure that our cash dividend will not be reduced, or eliminated, in the future.
certain provisions of our corporate governing documents, delaware law and our senior notes could discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition.
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock. for example, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the number of shares in a series, the consideration, dividend rights, liquidation preferences, terms of redemption, conversion or exchange rights and voting rights, if any, of unissued series of preferred stock, without any vote or action by our stockholders. thus, our board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock. we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, which imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our common stock. these provisions could have the effect of delaying or deterring a third party from acquiring us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders, and accordingly could reduce the market price of our common stock.
certain provisions in the indentures governing the senior notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. upon an acquisition event that constitutes a "change of control," as defined in the indentures governing the senior notes, coupled with a downgrade in the ratings of the senior notes, holders of such notes will have the right to require us to purchase their notes in cash. our obligations under the senior notes could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, and accordingly could cause a reduction in the market price of our common stock.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global provider of medical technology products focused on enhancing clinical benefits, improving patient and provider safety and reducing total procedural costs. we primarily design, develop, manufacture and supply medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications. approximately 94% of our net revenues come from single-use medical devices. we market and sell our products worldwide through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors. because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures, we are not dependent upon any one end-market or procedure. we are focused on achieving consistent, sustainable and profitable growth by increasing our market share and improving our operating efficiencies.
we evaluate our portfolio of products and businesses on an ongoing basis to ensure alignment with our overall objectives. based on our evaluation, we may seek to optimize utilization of our facilities through restructuring initiatives designed to further reduce our cost base and enhance our competitive position. in addition, we may continue to explore opportunities to expand the size of our business and improve our margins through a combination of acquisitions and distributor to direct sales conversions, which generally involve our elimination of a distributor from the sales channel, either by acquiring the distributor or terminating the distributor relationship (in some instances, the conversions involve our acquisition or termination of a master distributor and the continued sale of our products through sub-distributors). our distributor to direct sales conversions are designed to facilitate improved product pricing and more direct access to the end users of our products within the sales channel. further, we may identify opportunities to expand our margins through strategic divestitures of existing businesses and product lines that no longer meet our objectives.
acquisition on october 10, 2023, we completed the acquisition of palette, a privately held medical device company that sells a portfolio of hyaluronic acid gel-based products primarily utilized in the treatment of urology diseases including a rectal spacing product used in connection with radiation therapy treatment of prostate cancer. the fair value of consideration transferred was $621.9 million, consisting of net cash payments of $594.9 million and $27.0 million in estimated fair value of contingent consideration. the contingent consideration liability represents the estimated fair value of our obligations, under the acquisition agreement, to make two milestone payments up to $50 million, in aggregate, if certain commercial milestones are met. the acquisition was financed using borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
divestiture on may 15, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell certain product lines within our global respiratory product portfolio to medline for consideration of $286.0 million, reduced by $12 million in working capital not transferring to medline (the "respiratory business divestiture"). in connection with the respiratory business divestiture, we also entered into several ancillary agreements with medline to help facilitate the transfer of the business, which provide for transition support, quality, supply and manufacturing services, including a manufacturing and supply transition agreement (the "msta").
on june 28, 2021, we completed the initial phase of the respiratory business divestiture, pursuant to which we received cash proceeds of $259.0 million. on december 4, 2023, we completed the second and final phase of the respiratory business divestiture with the transfer of certain additional manufacturing assets to medline resulting in $15.0 million in additional cash proceeds and the recognition of a gain on sale of $4.4 million.
pension termination in may 2023, our board of directors approved the termination of the teleflex incorporated retirement income plan (the "trip"), a u.s. defined benefit plan, effective as of august 1, 2023. the trip is subject to the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended ("erisa"), and is intended to be tax-qualified under section 401(a) of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended ("code"). participation in and accrual of benefits under the trip have been frozen since 2012, and, as of december 31, 2023, the trip assets exceeded the liabilities. in june 2023, we notified participants of our intent to terminate the trip and requested a determination letter from the internal revenue services ("irs") stating that the trip satisfies the requirements, in form, to be tax-qualified under code section 401(a) upon termination. in september 2023, a notice of benefits was sent to participants, beneficiaries and alternate payees in connection with the proposed termination. participants, beneficiaries and alternate payees who had not started their trip benefits were offered the opportunity to elect to receive their benefits in the form of a lump sum distribution in connection with the termination of the trip or to commence their benefits in the form of monthly annuity payments in accordance with trip terms. because the trip is an erisa plan, the termination is subject to approval by the pension benefit guaranty corporation ("pbgc"). in september 2023, we filed a termination notice with the pbgc for approval. after the termination has been approved by the pbgc, one or more annuity contracts with a qualifying insurer(s) will be purchased to provide trip benefits that have not already been distributed. while we expect to proceed with the termination, we may decide not to proceed for certain reasons including, for example, if the cost to terminate the trip exceeds our current expectations. should the company proceed with the termination, participants, beneficiaries, and alternate payees will each receive the full value of their benefit under the trip, paid either from trip assets or from an annuity contract purchase as described under this paragraph.
upon settlement of the trip, we are required to remeasure the plan assets and obligation and will recognize a settlement loss for the recognition of the unrecognized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income including the effects of the remeasurement. in december 2023, we recognized a settlement charge of $45.2 million resulting from payments to eligible participants who elected the lump sum distribution option. as of december 31, 2023, the pre-tax accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the trip was approximately $150.5 million. we expect to recognize a settlement charge upon annuitization of the trip benefits, which we expect to occur during 2024. we also continue to evaluate our options with respect to trip plan assets in excess of liabilities ("surplus plan assets") remaining upon settlement of the trip. we may contribute any surplus plan assets to a qualified defined contribution savings plan, which would result in a charge equal to the surplus plan assets at the contribution date. as of december 31, 2023, the surplus plan assets were $26.3 million.
economic and other factors impacting our business our operations, supply chain, contractors, suppliers, customers and other business partners are impacted by various global macroeconomic factors. during 2023, we continued to experience elevated levels of overall cost inflation, specifically within materials and services, and we continue to monitor the impacts stemming from increases in interest rates and volatile exchange rates driven by monetary policy decisions of central banks as well as ongoing geopolitical conflicts. moreover, the healthcare industry has been impacted by a transition in the delivery, or site of service, where healthcare services are being performed and staffing shortages at healthcare facilities that could impact the demand for our products in the future.
in the latter part of 2023, we began to experience stabilization with respect to some of the macroeconomic and other factors discussed above, including but not limited to lower logistics and distribution cost inflation and a decrease in staffing shortages at healthcare facilities. in addition, we have implemented various measures designed to mitigate the future impacts of these factors impacting our business. due to the dynamic nature of the macroeconomic and other factors discussed above, we cannot accurately predict the extent, duration, or our ability to offset the impact of these factors or the related effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
results of operations as used in this discussion, "new products" are products for which commercial sales have commenced within the past 36 months, and "existing products" are products for which commercial sales commenced more than 36 months ago. discussion of results of operations items that reference the effect of one or more acquired businesses (except as noted below with respect to acquired distributors) generally reflects the impact of the acquisitions within the first 12 months following the date of the acquisition. in addition to increases and decreases in the per unit selling prices of our products to our customers, our discussion of the impact of product price increases and decreases also reflects the impact on the pricing of our products resulting from any elimination of distributors, either through acquisition or termination of the distributor, from the sales channel. all dollar amounts in tables are presented in millions unless otherwise noted.
for a discussion of our results of operations comparison for 2022 and 2021, refer to our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2022 filed on february 23, 2023.
comparison of 2023 and 2022
revenues
2023                                  2022
net revenues            $2,974.5                  $2,791.0
net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased by $183.5 million, or 6.6%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $149.2 million increase in sales of new products, price increases and net revenues generated by the acquired palette and standard bariatrics businesses, partially offset by a $61.0 million decrease in sales volume of existing products. the increase in sales of new products and the decrease in sales of volumes of existing products primarily reflect the conversion to the next generation of an existing product.
gross profit
2023                                                                2022
gross profit                     $1,646.9                   $1,531.1
percentage of revenues               55.4   %                   54.9   %
for the year ended december 31, 2023, gross margin increased 50 basis points, or 0.9%, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to price increases, benefits from cost improvement initiatives and lower logistics and distribution related costs, partially offset by continued cost inflation from macro-economic factors, specifically with respect to raw materials, and an unfavorable impact on manufacturing productivity due to constraints in raw material supply.
on april 4, 2023, one of our mexican subsidiaries received a notification from the mexican federal tax administration service ("sat") setting forth its preliminary findings with respect to a foreign trade operations audit carried out by sat for the period from july 1, 2017 to june 6, 2019. the preliminary findings stated that our mexican subsidiary did not evidence the export of goods temporarily imported under mexico's manufacturing, maquila and export services industries program ("immex program"), therefore triggering the potential obligation for payment of import duties, value added tax, customs processing fees and other fines and penalties, which may cause an adverse impact on our gross profit in the future. in response to the notification, our mexican subsidiary has requested that the matter be referred to the procuraduría de la defensa del contribuyente, or "prodecon," (local tax ombudsperson) to help facilitate the process. in june 2023, sat was provided with the appropriate documentation evidencing the export of the goods in accordance with the requirements of the immex program.
while we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of this audit, based on currently known information, we do not believe a loss is either probable or estimable. accordingly, no loss contingency has been recorded in our financial statements as of december 31, 2023 related to this matter. however, if the final resolution of the matter is not favorable to us, our mexican subsidiary may be required to make payment of certain import duties, fines and surcharges, which could be material.
selling, general and administrative
2023                                                                        2022
selling, general and administrative          $929.9                   $863.7
percentage of revenues                         31.3   %                 30.9   %
selling, general and administrative expenses increased $66.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to higher sales expenses across certain of our product portfolios, higher operating expenses incurred by the acquired palette and standard bariatrics businesses, higher performance related employee benefit costs, higher transaction costs stemming from our acquisition of palette and higher it related costs. the increases in selling, general and administrative expenses were partially offset by a decrease in contingent consideration expense resulting from changes in the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities.
research and development
2023                                                               2022
research and development            $154.4                   $153.8
percentage of revenues                 5.2   %                  5.5   %
research and development expenses increased $0.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to the prior year, which was primarily attributable to higher project spend within certain of our product portfolios and expenses incurred by standard bariatrics, partially offset by lower expenses related to the european union medical device regulation related costs.
pension settlement charge
2023                                                       2022
pension settlement charge          $45.2               $-
during the year ended december 31, 2023, we recognized a settlement charge of $45.2 million related to our plan to terminate the trip resulting from payments to eligible participants who elected a lump sum distribution.
restructuring and impairment charges
2023 restructuring plan during the fourth quarter of 2023, we initiated a new restructuring plan, which primarily involves the integration of palette into teleflex and workforce reductions designed to improve operating performance across the organization by creating efficiencies that align with evolving market demands and our strategy to enhance long-term value creation (the "2023 restructuring plan"). we estimate that we will incur $15 million to $19 million in aggregate pre-tax restructuring and restructuring related charges in connection with the 2023 restructuring plan. we expect this plan will be substantially completed by the end of 2024.
we expect to begin realizing plan-related savings in 2024 and expect to achieve annual pre-tax savings of $29 million to $35 million once the plan is fully implemented.
2023 footprint realignment plan in september 2023, we initiated a restructuring plan primarily involving the relocation of certain manufacturing operations to existing lower-cost locations, the outsourcing of certain manufacturing processes and related workforce reductions (the "2023 footprint realignment plan"). we estimate that we will incur $11 million to $15 million in aggregate pre-tax restructuring and restructuring related charges in connection with the 2023 footprint realignment plan. we expect this plan will be substantially completed by the end of 2027.
we expect to begin realizing plan-related savings in 2024 and expect to achieve annual pre-tax savings of $2 million to $4 million once the plan is fully implemented.
2022 restructuring plan in november 2022, we initiated a strategic restructuring plan designed to improve operating performance and position the organization to deliver long-term durable growth by creating efficiencies that align with our high growth strategic objectives (the "2022 restructuring plan"). the plan is substantially complete and as a result, we expect future restructuring expenses associated with the plan, if any, to be immaterial.
respiratory divestiture plan in 2021, in connection with the respiratory business divestiture, we committed to a restructuring plan designed to separate the manufacturing operations that will be transferred to medline from those that will remain with teleflex, which includes related workforce reductions (the "respiratory divestiture plan"). the plan is substantially complete and as a result, we expect future restructuring expenses associated with the plan, if any, to be immaterial.
the following table provides information regarding restructuring charges we have incurred with respect to each of our restructuring programs, as well as impairment charges, for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022. the restructuring charges listed in the table primarily consist of termination benefits.

the increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior year was primarily due to a higher average interest rate resulting from increases in interest rates associated with our variable interest rate debt instruments and an increase in average debt outstanding.
interest income for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to higher investments in time deposits and money market mutual funds.
gain on sale of assets and business

during the year ended december 31, 2023, we recognized a gain related to the second phase of the respiratory divestiture. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we recognized a gain related to a sale of a building.
loss on extinguishment of debt
2023                                              2022
loss on extinguishment of debt         $-                     $0.5
during the year ended december 31, 2022 we recognized a $0.5 million loss on extinguishment of debt due to the write off of unamortized deferring financing costs related to the amendment of our senior credit facility.
taxes on income from continuing operations
2023                                                       2022
effective income tax rate           17.6   %           18.6   %
the effective income tax rate for 2023 was 17.6% compared to 18.6% for 2022. the effective income tax rate for 2023 reflects the impact of deferred charges resulting from a legal entity rationalization and the impact of a non-taxable contingent consideration adjustment recognized in connection with a decrease in the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities. additionally, the effective income tax rate for 2023 reflects a tax benefit associated with the trip pension settlement charge. the effective income tax rate for 2022 reflects tax expense resulting from a deferred charge relating to the 2022 restructuring plan. the effective income tax rates for both 2023 and 2022 reflect tax expense resulting from a u.s. law effective in 2022 requiring capitalization of certain research and development expenditures. additionally, the effective income tax rates for both 2023 and 2022 reflect a net excess tax benefit related to share-based compensation and a tax benefit from research and development tax credits.
during 2023, a significant number of individual member states of the eu enacted legislation to establish a 15% global minimum tax in accordance with the pillar two eu directive. we continue to evaluate the impact the laws will have on our consolidated results of operations, but based on legislation currently enacted, we do not expect the laws to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

americas americas net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased $61.7 million, or 3.7%, compared to the prior year, which was primarily attributable to a $125.1 million increase in sales of new products, price increases and net revenues generated by the acquired palette and standard bariatrics businesses, partially offset by a $114.5 million decrease in sales volume of existing products. the increase in sales of new products and the decrease in sales of volumes of existing products primarily reflect the conversion to the next generation of an existing product.
americas operating profit for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased $1.1 million, or 0.2%, compared to the prior year, which was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit resulting from higher sales and price increases and a decrease in contingent consideration expense resulting from changes in the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities, partially offset by an increase in sales expenses to support higher sales and an increase in operating expenses incurred by the acquired palette and standard bariatrics businesses.

liquidity and capital resources we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. our principal source of liquidity is our cash flows provided by operating activities. our cash flows provided by operating activities are reduced by cash used to, among other things, fulfill contractual obligations for minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases, which often extend beyond one year; the weighted average remaining lease term of our operating lease portfolio is 7.0 years. our cash flows provided by operating activities are also reduced by cash used for unconditional legally binding commitments to purchase goods or services (i.e., purchase obligations), which are primarily related to inventory expected to be purchased within one year.
other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include contractual obligations such as scheduled principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding indebtedness and tax on deemed repatriation of non-u.s. earnings, which will be paid annually over the next three years. we may also be obligated to make payments for contingent consideration due to past acquisitions, the timing and amount of which may be uncertain, and the magnitude of which can vary from year to year. other significant factors that affect our liquidity include certain actions controlled by management such as capital expenditures, acquisitions, and dividends. see note 10, note 12 and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
we believe our cash flow from operations, available cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our revolving credit facility (which is provided for under the credit agreement) and accounts receivable securitization facility will enable us to fund our operating requirements, capital expenditures and debt obligations for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.
of our $222.8 million of cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2023, $196.7 million was held at non-u.s. subsidiaries. we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which we can access those funds on a cost effective basis.
in october 2023, the agreements related to our cross-currency swaps entered into in 2018 matured resulting in $43.0 million in cash settlement proceeds. on october 2, 2023, we executed new cross-currency swap agreements with six different financial institution counterparties to hedge against the effect of variability in the u.s. dollar to euro exchange rate (the "2023 cross-currency swap agreements"). under the terms of the new swap agreements, we notionally exchanged $500 million at an interest rate of 4.63% for €474.7 million at an interest rate of 3.05%. the 2023 cross-currency swap agreements, which expire on october 4, 2025, are designated as net investment hedges and require an exchange of the notional amounts upon expiration or the earlier termination of the agreements.
in december 2023, we entered into a zero cost foreign exchange collar contract that aligns with the notional amount and expiration date of the 2023 cross-currency swaps. we sold a put option with a lower strike price and bought a call option with a higher strike price to manage the foreign exchange risk related to the final settlement of the $500 million notional cross currency swaps. upon the execution of the zero cost foreign exchange collar contract, we have de-designated the existing $500 million notional cross-currency swaps and re-designated the combined $500 million notional cross currency swaps and zero cost collar into a new hedging instrument. at re-designation, the existing $500 million notional cross-currency swaps were off-market due to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. the off-market value due to interest rates will be amortized ratably into earnings through october 2025 and the off-market value due to foreign exchange rates will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying net investment is sold. the combined cross-currency swaps and zero cost collar has been designated as a net investment hedge for accounting purposes.
under the terms of our outstanding euro cross-currency swap agreements, we notionally exchanged in the aggregate $750 million for €693.9 million. the swap agreements begin to expire in march 2024. we and the counterparties have agreed to effect the exchange through a net settlement. as a result, we may be required to pay (or be entitled to receive) an amount equal to the difference, on the expiration or earlier termination dates, between the u.s. dollar equivalent of the €693.9 million notional amount and the $750 million notional amount. if, at the expiration or earlier termination of the swap agreements, the u.s. dollar to euro exchange rate has increased or decreased by 10% from the rate in effect at the inception of these agreements, we would either receive an aggregate payment of approximately $34.4 million from the counterparties or be required to make an aggregate payment of approximately $75 million to the counterparties in respect of the notional settlement. as of december 31, 2023, we had $16.5 million in current assets and $31.3 million in non-current liabilities related to the fair value of our cross-currency swap agreements. the swap agreements entail risk that the counterparties will not fulfill their obligations under the agreements. however, we believe the risk is reduced because we have entered into separate agreements with different counterparties, all of which are large, well-established financial institutions.
we may at any time, from time to time, repurchase our outstanding debt securities in open market purchases, via tender offers or in privately negotiated transactions, exchange transactions or otherwise, at such price or prices as we deem appropriate. such purchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors and may be commenced or suspended at any time.

cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $511.7 million during 2023, and $342.8 million during 2022. the $168.9 million increase was primarily attributable to lower tax payments, favorable changes in working capital and favorable operating results. the favorable changes in working capital were primarily driven by lower inventory purchases stemming from the build up of inventory in the prior year due to elevated global supply chain volatility.
cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $621.2 million during 2023, which primarily consisted of $603.9 million in net payments for businesses and intangibles acquired, primarily related to the palette acquisition, and $91.4 million of capital expenditures, partially offset by $63.1 million in net interest proceeds on swaps designated as net investment hedges and $15.0 million in proceeds from the second phase of the respiratory divestiture.
cash flow from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was $38.5 million during 2023, which primarily consisted of $101.3 million in net proceeds from borrowings resulting from a $600 million draw on our senior credit facility to fund the acquisition of palette, partially offset by payments against the senior credit facility. net cash provided by financing activities for the year also reflects $63.9 million in dividend payments.

free cash flow free cash flow is a non-gaap financial measure and is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations. this financial measure is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s., or gaap, and should not be considered a substitute for net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, the most comparable gaap financial measure. management believes that free cash flow is a useful measure to investors because it facilitates an assessment of funds available to satisfy current and future obligations, pay dividends and fund acquisitions. we also use this financial measure for internal managerial purposes and to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations, such as debt service, that are not deducted from the measure. we strongly encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable gaap measure.

financing arrangements senior credit facility on november 4, 2022, we amended and restated our existing credit agreement by entering into a third amended and restated credit agreement (the "credit agreement") which provides for a five-year revolving credit facility of $1.0 billion and a term loan facility of $500.0 million. the obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed (subject to certain exceptions and limitations) by substantially all of our material domestic subsidiaries. the obligations under the credit agreement are secured, subject to certain exceptions and limitations, by a lien on substantially all of the assets owned by us and each guarantor. the maturity date of the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility under the credit agreement is november 4, 2027.
at our option, loans under the credit agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to adjusted term secured overnight lending rate (sofr) plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.125% to 2.00% or at an alternate base rate, which is defined as the highest of (i) the "prime rate" in the u.s. last quoted by the wall street journal, (ii) 0.50% above the greater of the federal funds rate and the rate comprised of both overnight federal funds and overnight eurodollar transactions denominated in dollars and (iii) 1.00% above the term sofr rate for a one month interest period, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.125% to 1.00%, in each case subject to adjustments based on our total net leverage ratio. overdue loans will bear interest at the rate otherwise applicable to such loans plus 2.00%.
at december 31, 2023, we had $262.0 million in borrowings outstanding and $0.9 million in outstanding standby letters of credit under our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility.
the credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants that, in each case, subject to certain exceptions, qualifications and thresholds, (a) place limitations on us and our subsidiaries regarding the incurrence of additional indebtedness, additional liens, fundamental changes, dispositions of property, investments and acquisitions, dividends and other restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, restrictive agreements, changes in lines of business and swap agreements, and (b) require us and our subsidiaries to comply with sanction laws and other laws and agreements, to deliver financial information and certain other information and give notice of certain events, to maintain their existence and good standing, to pay their other obligations, to permit the administrative agent and the lenders to inspect their books and property, to use the proceeds of the credit agreement only for certain permitted purposes and to provide collateral in the future. subject to certain exceptions, we are required to maintain a maximum total net leverage ratio of 4.50 to 1.00. we are further required to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00. as of december 31, 2023, we were in compliance with the covenants in the credit agreement.
2027 and 2028 senior notes as of december 31, 2023, the outstanding principal amount of our 2027 notes and 2028 notes (collectively the "senior notes") was $500 million, respectively. the indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that, among other things among other things and subject to certain exceptions, limit or restrict our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to create liens; consolidate, merge or dispose of certain assets; and enter into sale leaseback transactions. the obligations under the senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by each of our existing and future 100% owned domestic subsidiaries that are a guarantor or other obligor under the credit agreement and by certain of our other 100% owned domestic subsidiaries. as of december 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all of the terms of our senior notes.
accounts receivable securitization we have an accounts receivable securitization facility under which we sell an undivided interest in domestic accounts receivable for consideration of up to $75 million to a commercial paper conduit. as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, we borrowed the maximum amount available of $75 million under this facility. this facility is utilized to provide increased flexibility in funding short term working capital requirements. the agreement governing the accounts receivable securitization facility contains certain covenants and termination events. an occurrence of an event of default or a termination event under this facility may give rise to the right of our counterparty to terminate this facility. as of december 31, 2023, we were in compliance with the covenants and none of the termination events had occurred.
for additional information regarding our indebtedness, see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ materially from the amounts derived from those estimates and assumptions.
we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates, which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. the following discussion should be considered in conjunction with the description of our accounting policies in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k.
inventory utilization inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. factors utilized in the determination of estimated net realizable value and whether a reserve is required include (i) current sales data and historical return rates, (ii) estimates of future demand, (iii) competitive pricing pressures, (iv) new product introductions, (v) product expiration dates, and (vi) component and packaging obsolescence.
we review the net realizable value of inventory each reporting period and adjust as necessary. we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. in assessing historical usage, we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information in estimating future usage. our inventory reserve was $54.3 million and $47.1 million at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
long-lived assets we assess the remaining useful life and recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. for example, such an assessment may be initiated if, as a result of a change in expectations, we believe it is more likely than not that the asset will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its useful life or if an adverse change occurs in the business employing the asset. significant judgments in this area involve determining whether such events or circumstances have occurred and determining the appropriate asset group requiring evaluation. the recoverability evaluation is based on various analyses, including undiscounted cash flow projections, which involve significant management judgment. any impairment loss, if indicated, equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.
the increased use and the recent fda approval of glucagon-like peptide 1 ("glp-1") products for the treatment of chronic weight management has impacted the demand for bariatric surgery procedures and our titan sgs product line acquired as part of our 2022 acquisition of standard bariatrics inc. although the long term impact on bariatric procedures from glp-1 products is uncertain, to the extent glp-1 products reduce the long term demand for bariatrics surgery procedures and cause their prevalence to differ significantly from management's expectations, we ultimately may find it necessary to recognize future impairment charges with respect to the related assets, which could be material.
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets include indefinite-lived assets (such as goodwill, certain trade names and in-process research and development ("ipr&d")), as well as finite-lived intangibles (such as trade names that do not have indefinite lives, customer relationships, intellectual property, distribution rights and non-competition agreements) and are, generally, obtained through acquisition. intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value and we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill. considerable management judgment is necessary in making the assumptions used in the estimated fair value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination.
the costs of finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life. determining the useful life of an intangible asset requires considerable judgment as different types of intangible assets typically will have different useful lives. goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; we test these assets annually for impairment during the fourth quarter, using the first day of the quarter as the measurement date, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment may have occurred. such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations.
goodwill goodwill impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level. for purposes of this assessment, our reporting units are our operating segments, or, in certain cases, a business one level below our operating segments. as the fair values of our reporting units are more likely than not greater than the carrying values, no impairment was recorded as a result of the annual goodwill impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2023.
in applying the goodwill impairment test, we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our products and services, regulatory and political developments, and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance. if, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a quantitative impairment test described below. alternatively, we may test goodwill for impairment through the quantitative impairment test without conducting the qualitative analysis.
under a quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying value. we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit using a combination of two methods; one which estimates the discounted cash flows of the reporting unit based on projected earnings in the future (the income approach) and one which is based on revenue and ebitda of similar businesses to those of the reporting unit in actual transactions (the market approach). if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, there is no impairment. if the reporting unit carrying value exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment loss based on the amount the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value.
the more significant judgments and assumptions in determining fair value using in the income approach include (1) the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales, operating income, industry trends and the regulatory environment of the individual reporting units, (2) the expected long-term growth rates for each of our reporting units, which approximate the expected long-term growth rate of the global economy and of the medical device industry, and (3) the discount rates that are used to estimate the present value of the future cash flows, which are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units along with various market based inputs. the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the market approach include (1) determination of appropriate revenue and ebitda multiples used to estimate a reporting unit's fair value and (2) the selection of appropriate comparable companies to be used for purposes of determining those multiples. there were no changes to the underlying methods used in 2023 as compared to the valuations of our reporting units in the past several years.
our expected future growth rates estimated for purposes of the goodwill impairment test are based on our estimates of future sales, operating income and cash flow and are consistent with our internal budgets and business plans, which reflect a modest amount of core revenue growth coupled with the successful launch of new products each year; the effect of these growth indicators more than offset volume losses from products that are expected to reach the end of their life cycle. changes in assumptions underlying the income approach could cause a reporting unit's carrying value to exceed its fair value. while we believe our assumed growth rates of sales and cash flows are reasonable, the possibility remains that the revenue growth of a reporting unit may not be as high as expected, and, as a result, the estimated fair value of that reporting unit may decline. in this regard, if our strategy and new products are not successful and we do not achieve anticipated core revenue growth in the future with respect to a reporting unit, the goodwill in the reporting unit may become impaired and, in such case, we may incur material impairment charges. moreover, changes in revenue and ebitda multiples in actual transactions from those historically present could result in an assessment that a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, in which case we also may incur material impairment charges.
other intangible assets intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill. management tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. similar to the goodwill impairment test process, we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. if, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount, the asset is not impaired. if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value, we then proceed to a quantitative impairment test, which consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount. alternatively, we may elect to forgo the qualitative analysis and test the indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment through the quantitative impairment test.
in connection with intangible assets acquired in a business combination and quantitative impairment tests, we determine the estimated fair value using various methods under the income approach. the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the valuation of intangible assets may include revenue growth rates, royalty rate, obsolescence factor, distributor margin, discount rates, attrition rate, and ebitda margin. each of these factors and assumptions can significantly impact the value of the intangible asset.
we did not record any impairment charges related to intangible assets during the years ended december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022. see "restructuring and impairment charges" within "result of operations" above as well as note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information on these charges.
contingent consideration liabilities in connection with an acquisition, we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified objectives, such as receipt of regulatory approval, commercialization of a product or achievement of sales targets. in a business combination, we record a contingent liability, as of the acquisition date, representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay. we determined the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities related to the palette and standard bariatrics acquisitions, which represented most of our contingent consideration liabilities at december 31, 2023, using a monte carlo valuation approach, which simulates future revenues during the earn out-period using management's best estimates. we determined the fair value of our other contingent consideration liabilities using a discounted cash flow analysis. significant judgment is required in determining the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the contingent consideration. increases in projected revenues and probabilities of payment may result in significantly higher fair value measurements; decreases in these items may have the opposite effect. increases in discount rates in the periods prior to payment may result in significantly lower fair value measurements; decreases may have the opposite effect. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
we remeasure our contingent consideration liabilities each reporting period and recognize the change in the liabilities' fair value within selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, we accrued $39.5 million and $44.0 million of contingent consideration, respectively, related to completed business combinations.
if the transaction is determined to be an asset acquisition rather than a business combination, a contingent consideration liability is recognized when the specified objective is deemed probable and is estimable.
income taxes our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. the difficulties inherent in such assessments, judgments and estimates are particularly challenging because we conduct a broad range of operations around the world, subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international jurisdictions. as a result, we are at times subject to tax audits, disputes with tax authorities and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. in connection with its estimates of our tax assets and liabilities, management must, among other things, make judgments about the outcome of these uncertain matters.
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases are recovered or settled. the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income, our ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks, final u.s. and non-u.s. tax settlements, changes in tax law, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions. while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities, which could be material.
in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we evaluate positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events, including results of operations and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. based on this assessment, we determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized, in which case we apply a valuation allowance to offset the amount of such deferred tax assets. to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required. the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $95.7 million and $91.5 million at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions.
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. we establish additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. in the normal course of business, we are examined by various federal, state and non-u.s. tax authorities. we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. we adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in any period in which we become aware of facts that necessitate an adjustment. we are currently under examination in germany and italy. the ultimate outcome of these examinations could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities, which would affect our financial results. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding our uncertain tax positions.
new accounting standards see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards, including estimated effects, if any, of the adoption of those standards on our consolidated financial statements.

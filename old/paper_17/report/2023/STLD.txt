item 1a.          risk factors many factors may have an effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic, environmental, regulatory, political, industry, business and financial conditions. the factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively impact us.
global and national risks related to our business our industry, as well as the industries of many of our customers and suppliers upon whom we are dependent, is affected by domestic and global economic factors including periods of slower than anticipated economic growth and the risk of a recession.
our financial results are substantially dependent not only upon overall economic conditions in the united states and globally, including north america, europe and in asia, but also as they may affect one or more of the industries upon which we depend for the sale of our products. global or domestic actions or conditions, including political actions, trade policies or restrictions, proposed or actual changes in tax laws, such as those introduced, proposed or actual regulation, including those related to the environment, interest rates, terrorism, acts of war or hostility, natural disasters, or pandemics, epidemics, widespread illness or other health issues, could result in changing economic conditions in the united states and globally, disruptions to or slowdowns in our business, our supply chain, or our global or domestic industry, or those of our customers or suppliers upon whom we are dependent. additionally, periods of slower than anticipated economic growth could reduce customer confidence and adversely affect demand for our products and further adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. metals industries have historically been vulnerable to significant declines in consumption and product pricing during periods of economic downturn or continued uncertainty, including the pace of domestic non-residential construction activity.
our business is also dependent upon certain industries, such as construction, automotive, manufacturing, transportation, heavy and agriculture equipment, energy and pipe and tube (including octg) markets, and these industries are also cyclical in nature and may experience supply chain disruptions. therefore, these industries may experience their own fluctuations in demand for our products based on such things as economic conditions, interest rates, supply chain disruptions, raw material and energy costs, consumer demand, the rate of inflation and infrastructure funding decisions by governments. many of these factors are beyond our control. as a result of volatility in our industry or in the industries we serve, we may have difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability. a downturn in our industry or the industries we serve may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
a prospective decline in consumer and business confidence and spending, which is often coupled with reductions in the availability of credit or increased cost of credit and interest rates, as well as volatility in the capital and credit markets, may adversely affect the business and economic environment in which we operate and the profitability of our business. we are also exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers, which during times of high interest rates can be intensified. if the availability of credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers' business operations is curtailed or if the cost of that credit is high, the resulting inability of our customers or of their customers to either access credit or absorb the cost of that credit may adversely affect our business by reducing our sales or by increasing our exposure to losses from uncollectible customer accounts. a disruption of the credit markets could also result in financial instability of some of our customers and suppliers. the consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers, the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase, and bankruptcy of customers, suppliers or other creditors. any of these events may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
23
global steelmaking overcapacity and imports of steel into the united states may adversely affect united states steel prices, which, together with increased scrap prices, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
global steelmaking capacity currently exceeds global consumption of steel products, which adversely affects united states and global steel prices. such excess capacity sometimes results in steel manufacturers in certain countries exporting steel and steel products, at prices that are lower than prevailing domestic prices, and sometimes at or below their cost of production. excessive imports of steel and steel products, into the united states, may exert downward pressure on united states steel and steel products prices, which adversely affects our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. fluctuations in the value of the dollar can also affect imports, as a strong united states dollar makes imported products less expensive, potentially resulting in more imports of steel and steel products into the united states by our foreign competitors. furthermore, the introduction of additional domestic steel capacity could increase this global overcapacity. this, in turn, has led to and may further lead to increased domestic demand for ferrous scrap resulting in increased scrap prices. our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows are driven primarily from the metal spread achieved from the price we sell steel and steel products compared to the price of our metallic raw materials, including scrap. during prolonged periods of steel and steel products overcapacity, leading to lower selling prices, combined with high demand for scrap and raw materials, leading to higher buying prices, our metal spreads could be compressed, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
united states steel producers compete with many foreign producers, including those in china, vietnam and other asian and european countries. competition from foreign producers is typically strong and is periodically exacerbated by weakening of the economies of certain foreign steelmaking countries, at times leading to imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers. some foreign steel producers are owned, controlled or subsidized by foreign governments. as a result, decisions by these producers with respect to their production, sales and pricing are sometimes influenced to a greater degree by political and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market conditions, realities of the marketplace or consideration of profit or loss. additionally, at times when iron ore prices are low, disruption of the scrap price correlation to iron ore may occur, which may lead to reduced global costs to produce steel, further depressing steel import prices. a higher volume of steel imports into the united states tends to occur at depressed prices when foreign steelmaking countries experience periods of economic difficulty, decreased demand for steel products or excess capacity. the global steelmaking overcapacity is exacerbated by chinese steel production capacity that far exceeds that country's demand and has made china a major global exporter of steel, resulting in weakened global steel pricing than otherwise would be expected. while measures to curb unfair trade such as tariffs, duties or quotas, along with trade agreements with other countries, have decreased the volume of steel and steel products imports, domestic steel and steel products prices can be negatively impacted by excessive imports of steel and steel products. should current tariffs, duties or quotas expire or be relaxed, repealed or circumvented by importers of steel and steel products, or should trade agreements be renegotiated, downward pressure may be exerted on united states steel and steel products prices, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
pandemics, epidemics, widespread illness or other health issues may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity, and stock price.
pandemics, epidemics, widespread illness or other health issues may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price. government actions globally, including united states federal and state governmental actions, related to pandemics, epidemics, widespread illness or other health issues have historically impacted demand for our products, our supply chain, our employees, the economy generally, inflation and high interest rates, and any similar future actions may result in similar or additional impacts.
industry risks related to our business our level of production and our sales and earnings are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of the steel industry and some of the industries we serve.
24
the steel manufacturing business is cyclical in nature, and the selling price of the steel we make may fluctuate significantly due to many factors beyond our control. furthermore, a number of our products are commodities, subject to their own cyclical fluctuations in supply and demand in both metal consuming and metal generating industries, including the construction and manufacturing industries. the timing, magnitude and duration of these cycles and the resulting price fluctuations are difficult to predict. the sale of our manufactured steel products is directly affected by demand for our products in other cyclical industries, such as construction, automotive, manufacturing, transportation, heavy and agriculture equipment, energy and pipe and tube (including octg) markets. economic difficulties, stagnant or slow global economies, supply and demand imbalances, supply chain disruptions, periods of heightened inflation or high interest rates, and currency fluctuations in the united states or globally may decrease the demand for our products or increase the amount of imports of steel into the united states, which may decrease our sales, margins and profitability.
volatility and major fluctuations in prices and availability of scrap metal, scrap substitutes and supplies, and our potential inability to pass higher costs on to our customers, may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins.
steel producers require large amounts of raw materials, including ferrous scrap metal and scrap substitute products such as pig iron and pelletized iron, and other supplies such as zinc, graphite electrodes and ferroalloys. the principal raw material of our eaf steel operations is recycled ferrous scrap derived from, among other sources, "home scrap," generated internally at steel mills themselves, industrial scrap, generated as a by-product of manufacturing, obsolete scrap, recycled from end-of-life automobiles, appliances and machinery, and demolition scrap, recycled from obsolete structures, containers and machines. the prices for scrap are subject to market forces largely beyond our control, including demand by united states and foreign steel producers, freight costs and speculation. the scrap metal recycling industry has historically been, and is expected to remain, highly cyclical and the prices for scrap have varied significantly in the past, may vary significantly in the future and do not necessarily fluctuate in tandem with the price of steel. moreover, some of our integrated steel producer competitors are not as dependent as we are on ferrous scrap as a part of their raw material melt mix, which, during periods of high scrap costs relative to the cost of blast furnace iron used by the integrated producers, give them a raw material cost advantage over eaf mills. however, given environmental considerations of investors, customers and regulators, additional eaf mills may be constructed, or companies currently operating blast furnace mills may invest in eaf mills, leading to increased demand in ferrous scrap possibly resulting in higher scrap prices. while our vertical integration into the metals recycling business and our liquid pig-iron operations are expected to enable us to continue being a cost-effective supplier to our own steelmaking operations, for some of our metallics requirements, we still rely on other metallics and raw material suppliers, as well as upon general industry supply conditions for the balance of our needs.
the availability and prices of raw materials and supplies, particularly those with positive environmental attributes, may also be negatively affected by new, existing or changing laws, regulations, sanctions or embargoes, including those that may impose output limitations or higher costs associated with climate change or ghg allocation by suppliers, interruptions in production, accidents or natural disasters, changes in exchange rates, global price fluctuations, the availability and cost of transportation, and competing uses, all of which may be heighted during times of war or hostilities. as a major producer of galvanized steel products, we purchase and consume a large amount of zinc, which if purchased at high prices, may adversely affect our profit margins. any inability to secure a consistent, cost-effective and timely supply of our raw materials and supplies may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
additionally, our inability to pass on all or a substantial part of any cost increases, whether due to positive environmental attributes, inflation, supply and demand imbalances, or otherwise, or to provide for our customers' needs because of the potential unavailability of raw materials, supplies or required environmental attributes, may result in production slowdowns or curtailments or may otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the cost and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions.
we consume large amounts of energy to melt scrap, reheat semi-finished products for rolling into finished products and perform other steps necessary to our production process. we rely on third parties for the supply of energy resources
25
we require in our production activities. the prices for and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil and other energy resources, including renewable or other clean energy sources, are subject to regulation and volatile market conditions, often affected by weather conditions as well as political, environmental and economic factors beyond our control. as large consumers of electricity and natural gas, we must have dependable delivery in order to operate. accordingly, we are at risk in the event of an energy disruption, including power outages, power unavailability or inability to obtain power at a reasonable price or with sufficient desired environmental attributes. prolonged blackouts, curtailments or disruptions caused by natural disasters or by political or environmental considerations would substantially disrupt our production. since a significant portion of our finished products are delivered by truck, unforeseen fluctuations in the price of fuel would also adversely affect our costs or the costs of many of our customers.
increased environmental, ghg emissions and sustainability considerations from our customers or related regulations could affect demand for our products and add significant costs.
customers, investors and regulators have increased their focus on the environment, ghg emissions and sustainability. we are committed to the environment and sustainability. we are taking further action to reduce our environmental footprint through our 2025, 2030, and 2050 goals for ghg emission reduction and increased renewable energy usage. we believe that achievement of these goals will comport with expectations of our customers and investors, but certain customers and investors may have differing requirements. to achieve these goals, our operational costs may increase and we have had and will continue to have additional capital expenditures, some of which we may not be able to pass along to our customers. any failure to timely meet these goals, or other requirements of customers or investors, may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and stock price.
additionally, governmental agencies, regulators, investors or other groups have introduced, and may request or require, environmental monitoring, disclosures or regulations in response to the potential impacts of climate change. international treaties or agreements may also result in increasing regulation of ghg emissions, including the introduction of carbon emissions limitations or trading mechanisms. any such regulation or disclosure requirement could impose significant costs on our operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, emissions controls, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with current or future laws, regulations or demands concerning the environment, climate change, ghg emissions and sustainability. any adopted regulations could negatively impact our ability, and that of our customers and suppliers, to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to or not complying with such regulations, or could affect our environmental disclosures for any allowances, offsets or credits. we may see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit ghgs as a result of these initiatives, which may impact our operations directly or through our customers and suppliers.
compliance with and changes in environmental and remediation requirements may result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs.
existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or as may be interpreted in the future, as well as future laws or regulations, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
we are subject to numerous local, state, federal and international statutory and regulatory environmental requirements relating to, among other things:
●the generation, storage, treatment, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and secondary materials;
●   the discharge of materials into the air, including periodic changes to the national ambient air quality standards and to emission standards;

●the management, treatment and discharge of wastewater and storm water;
●the use and treatment of groundwater;
●the remediation of soil and groundwater contamination;
●climate change legislation or regulation;
26
●the need for and the ability to timely obtain air, water or other environmental permits;
●the timely reporting of certain chemical usage, content, storage and releases;
●the remediation and reclamation of land used in our operations;
●natural resource protections; and
●the protection of our employees' health and safety.
compliance with environmental laws and regulations, which affect our eaf steelmaking, metals recycling, liquid pig-iron, and copper and aluminum production operations, is a significant factor in our business. we are required to obtain and comply with environmental permits and licenses, and failure to obtain or renew or the violation of any permit or license may result in substantial fines and penalties, capital expenditures, operational changes, suspension of operations and/or the closure of a subject facility. similarly, delays, increased costs and/or the imposition of onerous conditions to the securing or renewal of permits may adversely affect these operations.
uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels, testing and sampling procedures, and new pollution control technology are factors that may increase our future compliance expenditures. we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with environmental requirements or their effect on our operations. although we strive to be in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, legal requirements frequently change and are subject to interpretation such that regulatory agencies may bring enforcement actions for alleged noncompliance. private parties might also bring claims against us under citizen suit provisions and/or for property damage or personal injury allegedly resulting from our operations. new laws, regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities, together with uncertainty regarding the application of existing requirements, are among the factors that may increase our future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. the cost of complying with existing laws or regulations as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, or with future laws or regulations, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
our operations produce significant amounts of by-products, some of which are handled as solid or hazardous waste or as hazardous secondary materials. for example, our steel mills generate eaf dust, which the united states environmental protection agency (united states epa) and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste and regulate accordingly unless recycled in an exempt manner.
in addition, the feed materials for the shredders operated by our metals recycling operations include automobile bodies. a portion of the feed materials consist of currently unrecyclable material known as shredder residue. if laws or regulations or the interpretation of the laws or regulations change with regard to eaf dust or shredder residue or other by-products created by our operations, we may incur significant additional expenditures.
federal and state environmental laws enable federal and state agencies and certain private parties to recover from owners, operators, generators and transporters the cost of investigation and cleanup of sites at which wastes or hazardous substances were disposed and/or migrated. in connection with these laws, we may be required to clean up contamination discovered at our sites including contamination that may have been caused by former owners or operators of the sites, to conduct additional cleanup at sites that have already had some cleanup performed, to address emerging and newly-regulated contaminants such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (pfas) and 1,4-dioxane, and/or to perform cleanup with regard to sites formerly used in connection with our operations.
in addition, we may be required to pay for, or to pay a portion of, the costs of cleanup at sites to which we sent materials for disposal or recycling, notwithstanding that the original disposal or recycling activity may have complied with all regulatory requirements then in effect. under certain laws, a party can be held jointly and severally liable for all of the cleanup costs associated with a disposal site. in practice, a liable party often splits the costs of cleanup with other potentially responsible parties. we have received notices from the united states epa, state agencies and third parties that we have been identified as potentially responsible for the costs of investigating and cleaning up a number of disposal sites. in most cases, many other parties are also named as potentially responsible parties and also contribute to payment of those costs.
27
because cleanup liability can in some cases be imposed retroactively on activities that occurred many years ago, and because federal and state agencies are still discovering sites that pose a threat to public health or the environment, we can provide no assurance that we will not become liable for significant costs associated with investigation and remediation of cleanup sites.
operational and commercial risks related to our business we may face significant price and other forms of competition from other steel and aluminum producers, scrap processors and alternative materials, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the global markets in which steel companies and scrap processors conduct business are highly competitive and became even more so due to consolidations in the steel and scrap industries. additionally, in many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as aluminum, cement, composites, plastics, carbon fiber, glass and wood. increased use of alternative materials for any reason, including as a response to regulations or customer demands, could decrease demand for steel or force other steel producers into new products or markets that compete more directly with us, and combined with increased competition could cause us to lose market share, increase expenditures or reduce pricing, any one of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
additionally, during 2022 we announced our planned project to construct and operate a recycled aluminum flat rolled products mill with an anticipated annual production capacity of 650,000 tonnes of finished products to be located in columbus, mississippi, with two supporting satellite recycling aluminum slab centers.  although we anticipate being able to effectively compete in the aluminum industry, along with the other risks described herein, we may face unexpected and enhanced competition, which may adversely affect the expected contributions of our aluminum operations and our resulting business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
availability of an adequate source of supply of scrap is required for our metals recycling operations.
we procure our scrap inventory from numerous sources. these suppliers generally are not bound by long-term contracts and generally have no obligation to sell recyclable metal to us. in periods of low industry scrap prices, scrap suppliers may elect to hold recyclable metal to wait for higher prices or intentionally slow their metal collection activities. if a substantial number of scrap suppliers cease selling recyclable metal to us, we may be unable to recycle metal at desired levels which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, a slowdown of industrial production in the united states reduces the supply of industrial grades of metal to the metals recycling industry, resulting in our having less recyclable metal available to process and sell. further, additional eaf steel mill construction or blast furnace mills investing in eaf mills could increase the demand for scrap, potentially resulting in higher scrap prices or periods of decreased scrap supply. any inability to secure scrap for our eaf steel mills could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
we are subject to cybersecurity threats and may face risks to the security of our sensitive data and information technology which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
increased cybersecurity and information technology security requirements, vulnerabilities and threats and a rise in sophisticated and targeted cybercrime, all of which may be heightened during times of war or hostilities, pose a risk to the security and functionality of our systems and information networks, and to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary information, financial information, customer and supplier information, and personally identifiable information. additionally, cybersecurity vulnerabilities or attacks could result in an interruption of the functionality of our automated and electronically controlled manufacturing operating systems, which, if compromised, could cease, threaten, delay or slow down our ability to melt, roll or otherwise process steel or any of our other products for the duration of such interruption. our customers and suppliers may also store certain of our sensitive information on their information technology systems, which if breached or attacked, could likewise expose our sensitive information. similarly, information system vendors and software suppliers may experience a cybersecurity or information technology breach that exposes our systems or sensitive data. any of these cybersecurity
28
and information technology breaches or disruptions may result in reputational harm and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
although we believe we have adopted procedures, training programs, and controls to adequately protect our sensitive data, networks and information and operating technology and systems, there can be no assurance that a system or network failure, or cybersecurity breach or attack, will be prevented, whether due to attacks by cyber criminals or due to employee, contractor or other error or malfeasance. this could lead to system interruption, production delays or downtimes and operational disruptions, and the disclosure, modification or destruction of sensitive data, which may adversely affect our reputation, customer and supplier relationships, financial results and results of operations, and could result in litigation or regulatory investigations, actions, fines or penalties, as well as increased cybersecurity monitoring and protection costs, including the cost or availability of insurance. additionally, as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, we may need to invest additional time, resources and finances to protect the security of our sensitive data, systems and information networks. we maintain an information security risk insurance policy to mitigate the impact of cybersecurity threats.
we may face risks associated with the implementation of our growth strategy.
our growth strategy subjects us to various risks. as part of our growth strategy, we may expand existing facilities, enter into new business lines, products or process initiatives, acquire or build additional plants, acquire other businesses and assets, enter into joint ventures, or form strategic alliances that we believe will complement our existing business. these expansions and transactions, including our planned recycled aluminum flat rolled products mill with an anticipated annual production capacity of 650,000 tonnes of finished products to be located in columbus, mississippi, may involve some or all of the following risks:
● the risk of entering business lines or product, domestic, or foreign markets, in which we have little experience, including the aluminum industry;
● the risk of a newly constructed facility being completed over budget or not on time, including due to equipment delays or labor shortages;
● the risk of not being able to adequately obtain sufficient labor to efficiently build or staff a new facility, while maintaining our culture;
● the risk of expected markets, products, customers and demand for products produced by a new facility being lower than expected;
● the risk of new product development, technology development or customer acquisition and penetration being more costly or difficult than expected;
● the difficulty of competing for acquisitions and other growth opportunities with companies having materially greater financial resources than us;
● the inability to realize anticipated synergies or other expected benefits;
● the difficulty of integrating new or acquired operations and personnel into our existing operations, while maintaining our culture;
● the potential disruption of ongoing operations;
● the diversion of financial resources or management attention to new operations or acquired businesses;
● the loss of key employees, customers or suppliers of acquired businesses;
● the potential exposure to unknown liabilities;
29
● the inability of management to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;
● the difficulty of managing the growth of a larger company;
● the risk of becoming involved in labor, commercial, or regulatory disputes or litigation related to new operations or acquired businesses;
● the risk of becoming more highly leveraged;
● the risk of contractual or operational liability to other venture participants or to third parties as a result of our participation;
● the inability to work efficiently with joint venture or strategic alliance partners; and
● the difficulties of terminating joint ventures or strategic alliances.
delays in achieving full operational capacity at our sinton flat roll division has and may continue to, and any delays in our announced planned recycled aluminum flat rolled products mill may, adversely affect our prospects, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
these expansions or transactions might be required for us to remain competitive, but we may not be able to complete any such expansions or transactions on favorable terms or obtain financing, if necessary. future expansions and transactions may not improve our competitive position and business prospects as anticipated, and if they do not, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.
we are subject to litigation and legal compliance risks which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
we are involved from time to time in various litigation matters, including administrative proceedings, regulatory proceedings, governmental investigations, environmental matters, and commercial and construction contract disputes, none of which are currently expected to have a material impact on our financial conditions, results of operations or liquidity. for additional information regarding legal proceedings please refer to item 3. legal proceedings.
in addition to risks associated with our environmental and other regulatory compliance, our international operations are subject to complex foreign and united states laws and regulations, including the foreign corrupt practices act and other anti-bribery laws, regulations related to import-export controls, the office of foreign assets control, and other laws and regulations, each of which may increase our cost of doing business and expose us to increased risk.
unexpected equipment downtime or shutdowns may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
interruptions in our production capabilities may adversely affect our production costs, products available for sale and earnings during the affected period. in addition to equipment failures, our facilities are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions or violent weather conditions. our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of steelmaking equipment, such as our eafs, continuous casters and rolling equipment, some of which are controlled by our information technology systems, as well as electrical equipment, such as transformers. this equipment may, on occasion, be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures or other events, including equipment failure, power surges, cybersecurity breaches or attacks or system failures. further, we have experienced and may continue to experience ramp-up inefficiencies at our sinton flat roll division, including those related to major equipment failures. we have experienced and in the future may experience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of equipment failures or other events. supply chain disruptions and labor shortages have and may continue to exacerbate the effects of equipment failures.  these disruptions may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
30
governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew some of our licenses and permits required to operate our businesses.
some of our operations must receive licenses and air, water and other permits and approvals from federal, state and local governments to conduct certain of our operations or to build, expand or acquire new facilities. governmental agencies, non-governmental organizations, and members of the public sometimes resist the establishment of certain types of facilities in their communities. there can be no assurance that future approvals, licenses and permits will be granted or that we will be able to maintain and renew the approvals, licenses and permits we currently hold. failure to do so may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our senior unsecured credit facility contains, and any future financing agreements may contain, restrictive covenants that may limit our flexibility.
restrictions and covenants in our existing debt agreements, including our senior unsecured credit facility, and any future financing agreements, may impair our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. a breach of any of the restrictions or covenants could cause a default under our senior unsecured credit facility, our senior notes, or our other debt. a significant portion of our indebtedness may then become immediately due and payable.
under our senior unsecured credit facility, we are required to maintain certain financial covenants. our ability to meet such covenants or other restrictions can be affected by events beyond our control. if a default were to occur, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts then outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit.
impairment charges may adversely affect our results of operations.
occasionally, assumptions that we have made regarding products or businesses we have acquired or sought to develop, about the sustainability of markets we sought to exploit, or about industry conditions that underlie our decision making when we elected to capitalize a venture turn out differently than anticipated. in such instances, the fair value of such assets may fall below their carrying value recorded on our balance sheet.
accordingly, we periodically test goodwill, and other assets such as long-lived tangible and intangible assets, right of use assets and equity method investments when indicators of impairment are present, to determine whether their estimated fair value is in fact less than their value recorded on our balance sheet. if we determine that the fair value of any of these assets, from whatever cause, is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet, we are required to incur non-cash asset impairment charges that adversely affect our results of operations. there can be no assurances that market dynamics or other factors may not result in future impairment charges.

operating statement classifications net sales. net sales from our operations are a factor of volumes shipped, product mix and related pricing. we charge premium prices for certain grades of steel, product dimensions, certain smaller volumes, and for value-added processing or coating of our steel products. except for the steel fabrication operations, we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated returns and claims from these sales at the point in time control of the product transfers to the customer, upon shipment or delivery. our steel fabrication operations recognize revenues over time based on completed fabricated tons to date as a percentage of total tons required for each contract.
costs of goods sold. our costs of goods sold represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the manufacture of our products. the principal elements of these costs are scrap and scrap substitutes (which represent the most significant single component of our consolidated costs of goods sold), steel substrate, direct and indirect labor and related benefits, alloys, zinc, transportation and freight, repairs and maintenance, utilities such as electricity and natural gas, and depreciation.
39
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses consist of all costs associated with our sales, finance and accounting, and administrative departments, including, among other items, labor and related benefits, and professional services.
companywide profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets are each separately presented in the statement of income.
interest expense, net of capitalized interest. interest expense consists of interest associated with our senior credit facilities and other debt, net of interest costs that are required to be capitalized during the construction period of certain capital investment projects.
other (income) expense, net. other income consists of interest income earned on our temporary cash deposits, short-term and other investments, and any other non-operating income activity, including income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method. other expense consists of any non-operating costs, such as certain acquisition and financing expenses.
2023 overview during 2023, underlying domestic steel demand was firm, supported by the construction, automotive, and energy sectors. customer steel inventories also remained below historical averages, in combination resulting in generally steady order patterns. this solid market environment, coupled with the continued ramp-up of sinton, drove record annual shipments of 12.8 million tons for our steel operations. despite a challenging pricing environment throughout much of the year, our metals recycling teams meaningfully increased volume during 2023 compared to 2022. our steel fabrication business achieved its second highest annual earnings during 2023, on continued solid non-residential construction demand. our consolidated net sales of $18.8 billion and cash flow from operations of $3.5 billion were our second-best and our consolidated operating income of $3.2 billion was our third-best performance in company history. metal spread compression among each of our operating segments resulted in significantly lower operating income in 2023 compared to our record 2022 earnings despite continued strong market demand and volumes.
consolidated operating income for 2023 decreased $1.9 billion, or 38%, to $3.2 billion, compared to a record $5.1 billion in 2022. net income attributable to steel dynamics, inc. for 2023 decreased $1.4 billion, or 37%, to $2.5 billion, compared to a record in 2022. diluted earnings per share attributable to steel dynamics, inc. was $14.64 for 2023, compared to $20.92 for 2022.
effective the fourth quarter 2023, the company changed its reportable segments, consistent with how it currently manages the business, representing four reporting segments: steel operations (now including warehouse operations previously included in other), metals recycling operations, steel fabrication operations, and a new reportable segment, aluminum operations. segment information provided within this form 10-k has been recast for all prior periods consistent with the current reportable segment presentation. aluminum operations includes the results of the recycled aluminum flat rolled products mill in columbus, mississippi, and two satellite recycled aluminum slab centers located in arizona and mexico, all of which are currently being constructed. the results of this segment currently consist of construction and start-up costs recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, included within the discussion of consolidated results within the other operations section below. during 2023, there were no additional results of operations, such as those related to shipments or production, to be discussed. operations are expected to begin in 2025.
refer to item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, for additional information regarding results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, and segment operating results for 2022 as compared to 2021. our 2023 change in reportable segments did not change the discussion previously provided.

segment results 2023 vs. 2022
during 2023, our steel operations achieved record annual shipments of 12.8 million tons (11.4 million excluding intra-segment) a 5% increase over 2022 shipments, including 1.4 million tons from sinton during 2023, an increase of 67% over 2022. customer order activity and steel demand were strong during 2023, with the construction, automotive, industrial, and energy sectors continuing to lead demand. in spite of strong market demand, average selling prices were lower during 2023 compared to 2022, as total steel segment average selling prices decreased 18%, or $249 per ton, compared to 2022. sheet steel pricing was 22% lower, while long products pricing decreased 6%. net sales for the steel operations segment were 13% lower in 2023 when compared to historically high prices in 2022, due to lower average steel selling prices more than offsetting record volumes.
metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our single most significant steel manufacturing cost, generally comprising approximately 55% to 65% of our steel mill operations' manufacturing costs. our metallic raw material cost consumed in our steel mills decreased $61 per net ton, or 13%, in 2023 compared to 2022, consistent with overall decreased domestic scrap pricing noted below in the metals recycling operations segment discussion.
as a result of average selling prices decreasing more than scrap costs, specifically for sheet steel products, metal spread (which we define as the difference between average steel mill selling prices and the cost of ferrous scrap consumed in our steel mills) decreased 20% in 2023 compared to 2022. due to this metal spread compression, operating income for the steel operations decreased 39%, to $1.9 billion, in 2023 compared to 2022.
43
metals recycling operations segment

metals recycling operations includes both ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal processing, transportation, marketing, brokerage, and scrap management services. our steel mills utilize a large portion of the ferrous scrap sold by our metals recycling operations as raw material in our steelmaking operations, and the remainder is sold to other consumers, such as other steel manufacturers and foundries. in 2023 and 2022, 62% and 66%, respectively, of metals recycling operations ferrous scrap was sold to our own steel mills, while our steel mill utilization was 82% and 77% including sinton (91% and 92% exclusive of sinton) in 2023 and 2022, respectively. metals recycling operations accounted for 12% and 10% of our consolidated net sales during 2023 and 2022, respectively.

segment results 2023 vs. 2022
during 2023, our metals recycling operations continued to benefit from solid domestic steel industry demand, resulting in higher ferrous and nonferrous scrap shipments compared to 2022. we were able to increase shipments even as domestic steel mill utilization rates declined slightly to approximately 75% in 2023, as compared to approximately 78% in 2022. ferrous and nonferrous shipments increased 9% and 5%, respectively, in 2023 compared to 2022. net sales for our metals recycling operations in 2023 were comparable to 2022, as increased shipments were offset by ferrous and nonferrous average selling prices that decreased 7% and 8%, respectively, during 2023 compared to 2022.
ferrous metal spread (which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased scrap) decreased 7% and nonferrous metal spread increased 9% during 2023 compared to 2022. as a result of the overall decreased metals spreads, metals recycling operations operating income decreased 24% to $88.7 million in 2023 compared to 2022.

steel fabrication operations segment

steel fabrication operations include seven new millennium building systems joist and deck plants located throughout the united states, and in northern mexico. revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of trusses, girders, steel joists, and steel deck used within the non-residential construction industry. steel fabrication operations accounted for 15% and 19% of our consolidated net sales during 2023 and 2022, respectively.
segment results 2023 vs. 2022
our steel fabrication operations continue to benefit from the solid non-residential construction market, as evidenced by our historically strong order backlog that extends through the first half of 2024. the continued onshoring of manufacturing, coupled with the robust u.s. infrastructure and inflation reduction act programs and industrial construction, supports consistent strong demand. net sales for the steel fabrication operations decreased 34% during 2023 compared to the record levels during 2022, as average selling prices decreased $740 per ton, or 15%, and volumes decreased 23% from the record volume during 2022.
the purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of production for our steel fabrication operations, historically representing approximately two-thirds of the total cost of manufacturing. the average cost of steel consumed decreased 26% in 2023, as compared to 2022. due to decreased selling prices per ton more than offsetting decreased steel input costs per ton, metal spread (which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased steel) contracted 10% in 2023 compared to 2022. metal spread compression coupled with decreased volume resulted in operating income decreasing 34% to $1.6 billion in 2023, compared to $2.4 billion in 2022.

other operations

consolidated results 2023 vs. 2022
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses of $588.6 million during 2023 increased 8% from $545.6 million during 2022 primarily due to a 10% increase in payroll and benefits expense related to the execution of our growth strategy during 2023, including construction and start-up costs of our aluminum operations. selling, general and administrative expenses represented 3.1% and 2.5% of net sales during 2023 and 2022, respectively.
companywide profit sharing expense during 2023 of $272.0 million decreased 40% from $452.6 million during 2022, consistent with decreased pretax earnings. refer to note 11. retirement plans to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for further information.
interest expense, net of capitalized interest. during 2023, interest expense of $76.5 million decreased 16% from $91.5 million during 2022, due to higher capitalized interest in 2023 ($33.0 million, compared to $15.8 million in 2022) related to our ongoing expansion projects, most notably within aluminum operations.
other (income) expense, net.  net other income was $144.2 million in 2023, compared to $20.8 million in 2022, due primarily to an increase in interest income of $88.2 million associated with an increase in invested balances and an increase in yield earned on our invested cash and short-term investments in 2023.
income tax expense. during 2023, income tax expense of $751.6 million, at an effective income tax rate of 23.3%, decreased 34% compared to the $1.1 billion, at an effective income tax rate of 22.7%, during 2022, consistent with decreased pretax earnings. refer to note 4. income taxes to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information.
included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31, 2023, are potential benefits of $27.8 million that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. we recognize interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies on a net-of-tax basis in income tax expense. during the year ended december 31, 2023, we recognized expense from the increase of interest expense and penalties of $1.6 million, net of tax. in addition to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above, we had $3.2 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at december 31, 2023.
we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction as well as income tax returns in various state jurisdictions. the tax years 2020 through 2022 remain open to examination by the internal revenue service and various state and local jurisdictions. at this time, we do not believe there will be any significant examination adjustments that would result in a material change to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months in an amount ranging from zero to $10.0 million, as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations and other federal and state income tax audits.
46
liquidity and capital resources capital resources and long-term debt. our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for, among other things, the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our operations, and to remain in compliance with environmental laws. our short-term and long-term liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements, capital expenditures, including expansion projects, principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness, dividends to our shareholders, and potential stock repurchases and acquisitions or investments. we have met and intend to continue to meet these liquidity requirements primarily with available cash and cash provided by operations, long-term borrowings, and we also have availability under our unsecured revolver. our liquidity at december 31, 2023, is as follows (in thousands):

cash and equivalents                   $1,400,887
short-term and other investments                 951,873
unsecured revolver availability                1,190,873
total liquidity                        $3,543,633
our total outstanding debt of $3.1 billion is consistent with our total outstanding debt at december 31, 2022. our total long-term debt to capitalization ratio (representing our long-term debt, including current maturities, divided by the sum of our long-term debt, redeemable noncontrolling interests, and our total stockholders' equity) was 25.8% and 27.7% at december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, respectively.
in the third quarter of 2023, we entered into a new unsecured credit agreement, replacing the previous one, which has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (facility), which provides a $1.2 billion revolver and matures in july 2028. subject to certain conditions, we have the ability to increase the facility size by $500.0 million. the unsecured revolver is available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes. the facility contains financial covenants and other covenants pertaining to our ability to incur indebtedness and permit liens on certain assets. our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the unsecured revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial and other covenants. at december 31, 2023, we had $1.2 billion of availability on the revolver, $9.1 million of outstanding letters of credit and other obligations which reduce availability, and there were no borrowings outstanding.
the financial covenants under our facility state that we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.50:1.00. our interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our last-twelve-months (ltm) consolidated adjusted ebitda as defined in the facility (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and certain other non-cash transactions as defined in the facility) by our ltm gross interest expense, less amortization of financing fees. in addition, a debt to capitalization ratio of not more than 0.60:1.00 must be maintained. at december 31, 2023, our interest coverage ratio and debt to capitalization ratio were 36.13:1.00 and 0.26:1.00, respectively. we were, therefore, in compliance with these covenants at december 31, 2023, and we anticipate we will continue to be in compliance during the next twelve months.
working capital (representing excess of current assets over current liabilities). we generated cash flow from operations of $3.5 billion in 2023 compared to $4.5 billion in 2022. working capital decreased $1.2 billion, or 21%, during 2023 to $4.5 billion at december 31, 2023, due primarily to our accounts receivable and inventories decreasing $683.1 million, or 13%, compared to december 31, 2022, due to lower sales and inventory values in 2023. in addition, our $400 million 2.800% senior notes were recorded as current at december 31, 2023.
47
capital investments. during 2023, we invested $1.7 billion in property, plant and equipment, primarily within our aluminum operations and steel operations segments, compared with $908.9 million invested during 2022. we are currently executing our plan to invest $2.7 billion in a new state-of-the-art low-carbon recycled aluminum flat rolled products mill with two supporting satellite recycled aluminum slab centers, which is planned to be funded by available cash and cash flow from operations. related expenditures began in the third quarter of 2022 and are expected to continue through early 2025. our liquidity of $3.5 billion and anticipated future operating cash flow generation is sufficient to provide for our planned 2024 capital requirements.
cash dividends. as a reflection of continued confidence in our current and future cash flow generation capability and financial position, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 25% to $0.425 per share in the first quarter of 2023, and continued at that level through the remainder of 2023 (from $0.34 per share in 2022), resulting in declared cash dividends of $280.5 million during 2023, compared to $245.3 million during 2022. we paid cash dividends of $271.3 million and $237.2 million during 2023 and 2022, respectively. our board of directors, along with executive management, approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis. the determination to pay cash dividends in the future is at the discretion of our board of directors, after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, outstanding indebtedness, current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans.
other. our board of directors has authorized share repurchase programs during prior years, the most recent of which occurred in november 2023 for a program of up to $1.5 billion of the company's common stock. under the share repurchase programs, purchases take place as and when we determine in open market or private transactions made based upon the market price of our common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities or growth projects, our cash flows from operations, and general economic conditions. the share repurchase programs do not require us to acquire any specific number of shares, and may be modified, suspended, extended, or terminated by us at any time. the share repurchase programs do not have an expiration date. there were $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion of share repurchases during 2023 and 2022, respectively. as of december 31, 2023, we had $1.4 billion remaining available to purchase under the november 2023 share repurchase program. see part ii, item 5. market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for additional information.
our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which, in turn, will depend upon general economic, financial, and business conditions, along with competition, legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control. in addition, we cannot assure that our operating results, cash flows, access to credit markets and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future. we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth, cash flows from operations, together with other available sources of funds, including borrowings under our facility, if necessary, will be adequate for the next twelve months for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, funding working capital requirements, and funding anticipated capital expenditures.
contractual obligations and other long-term liabilities we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations, including purchase obligations, as defined by the securities and exchange commission. a "purchase obligation" is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.
long-term debt and estimated interest. refer to note 3. long-term debt to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for our long-term debt maturities. estimated interest payments on our senior unsecured notes were determined based on their outstanding balances through maturity at their contractual interest rates, as detailed in note 3. estimated interest payments also include a 0.15% commitment fee on our available revolver, and an average interest rate of 7.0% on our other debt of $61.8 million. our estimated interest payments are $102.2 million, $80.1 million, $74.9 million, $54.5 million, $50.0 million, for the years 2024 through 2028, respectively, and $343.2 million thereafter.
48
purchase obligations. we have commitments for the purchase of commodities such as electricity, water, natural gas and its transportation services, fuel, air products, zinc, and electrodes. refer to note 9. commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for this information.
construction commitments. we have firm contracts with various vendors for the completion of certain construction projects at our various divisions at december 31, 2023. refer to note 9. commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for this information.
lease commitments. we have entered into operating leases relating principally to transportation and other equipment, and some real estate. refer to note 12. leases to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for this information.
unrecognized tax benefits. we expect to make cash outlays in the future related to our unrecognized tax benefits; however, due to the uncertainty of the timing, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. refer to note 4. income taxes to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for this information.
other matters environmental and other contingencies we have incurred, and in the future will continue to incur, capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control, remediation, monitoring and compliance. during 2023, we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of approximately $54.6 million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately $5.4 million. of the costs incurred during 2023 for monitoring and compliance, approximately 71% were related to the normal transportation of certain types of by-products produced in our steelmaking processes and other facilities, in accordance with legal requirements. we incurred combined environmental remediation costs of approximately $3.1 million at all of our facilities during 2023. we have an accrual of $6.6 million recorded for environmental remediation related to our metals recycling operations, and $2.6 million related to our idled minnesota ironmaking operations. we believe, apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and any future manufacturing facilities, that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. however, environmental laws and regulations evolve and change, and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future, such as the impact of various governmental legislatures and agencies introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential of climate change.
critical accounting estimates management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. we review the accounting estimates we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions. we believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

impairments of long-lived tangible and definite-lived intangible assets. we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. impairment losses are recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets' carrying amounts. the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount. we consider various factors and determine whether an impairment test is necessary, including by way of examples, a significant and prolonged deterioration in operating results and/or projected cash flows, significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, technological advances with respect to assets which would potentially render them obsolete, our strategy and capital planning, and the economic environment in markets to be served. when determining future cash flows and if necessary, fair value, we must make judgments as to the expected utilization of assets and estimated future cash flows related to those assets. we consider historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all other available information at the time the estimates are made. those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate. there were no indicators of impairment or impairment charges recorded during 2023, 2022, of 2021.
goodwill.
our goodwill, relating to various business combinations, consisted of the following at december 31 (in thousands):

2023                 2022
steel operations segment                   $272,133             $272,133
metals recycling operations segment               203,413              228,009
steel fabrication operations segment                1,925                1,925
$477,471             $502,067
at least once annually (as of october 1), or when indicators of impairment exist, the company performs an impairment test for goodwill. goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally one level below the company's operating segments. the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a complex valuation model including an estimate of future cash flows utilizing a risk-adjusted discount rate to calculate the net present value of future cash flows (income approach), and for some years by using a market approach based upon an analysis of valuation metrics of comparable peer companies, using level 3 fair value inputs as provided for under asc 820. if the fair value exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit, there is no impairment. if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, with the impairment loss not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the discounted cash flows method (income approach) include: (a) expected cash flows for the five-year period following the testing date (including market share, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce and estimated capital needs); (b) an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit; and (c) a risk-adjusted discount rate based on management's best estimate of market participants' after-tax weighted average cost of capital and market risk premiums. key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the market approach include the expected revenues and cash flows in the next year. we consider historical and anticipated future results, general economic and market conditions, the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated. those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove accurate.
goodwill acquired in past transactions is naturally more susceptible to impairment, primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on operating plans and economic conditions at the time of acquisition. consequently, if operating results and/or economic conditions deteriorate after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the acquired asset. a deterioration of economic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and/or discount rates. additionally, we are required

to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. as a result, the cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless of whether our actual cost of capital has changed. therefore, we may recognize an impairment in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to or greater than our previously forecasted amounts. accordingly, discount rate scenario analysis is performed to evaluate the impact on estimated reporting unit fair values.
our fourth quarter 2023, 2022, and 2021 annual goodwill impairment analyses did not result in any impairment charges. management does not believe that it is reasonably likely that our reporting units will fail the goodwill impairment test in the near term, as the determined fair value of the reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value by more than an insignificant amount. changes in judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment, including expected future operating cash flows and discount rate, could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future and could result in an impairment of goodwill.
income taxes. we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements. this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheet. we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. we also establish reserves to reduce some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain. we adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited by a taxing authority and finally resolved. the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. a tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the "more likely than not" recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears. settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash.

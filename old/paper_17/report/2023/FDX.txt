item 1a. risk factors in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the price of our common stock. additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the price of our common stock.
macroeconomic and market risks we are directly affected by the state of the global economy and geopolitical developments. while macroeconomic risks apply to most companies, we are particularly vulnerable. the transportation industry is highly cyclical and especially susceptible to trends in economic activity. our primary business is to transport goods, so our business levels are directly tied to the purchase and production of goods and the rate of growth of global trade - key macroeconomic measurements influenced by, among other things, inflation and deflation, supply chain disruptions, interest rates and currency exchange rates, labor costs and unemployment levels, fuel and energy prices, public health crises, inventory levels, buying patterns and disposable income, debt levels, and credit availability. when individuals and companies purchase and produce fewer goods, we transport fewer goods, and as companies move manufacturing closer to consumer markets and expand the number of distribution centers, we transport goods shorter distances, which adversely affects our yields and profitability. certain manufacturers and retailers are making investments to produce and house goods in closer proximity to supply chains and consumers in connection with recent macroeconomic, geopolitical, and public health developments. additionally, consumer spending has shifted from goods to services, and in 2023 we saw a customer preference for slower, less costly shipping services. we expect these trends to continue. further, the scale of our operations and our relatively high fixed-cost structure, particularly at fedex express, make it difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels, which negatively affected our results of operations in 2023. for more information, see "our businesses are capital intensive, and we must make capital decisions based upon projected volume levels." below.
our results in 2023 were adversely impacted by lower global volumes due to weak economic conditions. we are experiencing a decline in demand for our transportation services as inflation and interest rate increases are negatively affecting consumer and business spending. additionally, we are experiencing higher costs to serve through higher fuel prices, wage rates, purchased transportation costs, and other direct operating expenses such as operational supplies. during 2024, we expect macroeconomic conditions to continue to negatively affect customer demand for our services. see item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition" of this annual report for additional information.
moreover, given the nature of our business and our global operations, political, economic, and other conditions in foreign countries and regions, including international taxes, government-to-government relations, the typically more volatile economies of emerging markets, and geopolitical risks such as the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine, may adversely affect our business and results of operations. we have suspended all services in ukraine and belarus. we also temporarily idled our operations in russia and reduced our presence to the minimum required for purposes of maintaining a legal presence with active transport licenses. while we do not expect this conflict to have a direct material effect on our business or results of operations, the broader consequences of this conflict, which may include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and geopolitical shifts; airspace bans relating to certain routes, or strategic decisions to alter certain routes; potential retaliatory action by the russian government against us as a result of our idling of operations in russia, including nationalization of foreign businesses in russia; increased tensions between the united states and countries in which we operate; and the extent of the conflict's effect on our business and results of operations as well as the global economy, cannot be predicted.
to the extent the current conflict between russia and ukraine, or subsequent similar conflicts between or among other nations, adversely affects our business, it may also have the effect of heightening many other risks disclosed in this annual report, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. such risks include, but are not limited to, disruptions to our global technology infrastructure, including through cyberattack or cyber-intrusion, ransomware attack, or malware attack; adverse changes in international trade policies; our ability to maintain or increase our prices, including our fuel surcharges in response to rising fuel costs; our ability to implement and execute our business strategy, particularly with regard to our fedex express international business; disruptions in global supply chains, which can limit the access of fedex and our service providers to vehicles and other key capital resources and increase our costs and could affect our ability to achieve our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040; our ability to maintain our strong reputation and the value of the fedex brand; terrorist activities targeting transportation infrastructure; our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; and constraints, volatility, or disruption in the capital markets. geopolitical uncertainty negatively affected operations at fedex express in recent years.
-  -
additional changes in international trade policies and relations could significantly reduce the volume of goods transported globally and adversely affect our business and results of operations. the u.s. government has taken certain actions that have negatively affected u.s. trade, including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported into the u.s. additionally, several foreign governments have imposed tariffs on certain goods imported from the u.s. these actions contributed to weakness in the global economy that adversely affected our results of operations in recent years. any further changes in u.s. or international trade policy, including tariffs, export controls, quotas, embargoes, or sanctions, could trigger additional retaliatory actions by affected countries, resulting in "trade wars" and further increased costs for goods transported globally, which may reduce customer demand for these products if the parties having to pay tariffs or other anti-trade measures increase their prices, or in trading partners limiting their trade with countries that impose such measures. political uncertainty surrounding international trade and other disputes could also have a negative effect on business and consumer confidence and spending. such conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as on the price of our common stock.
additionally, the u.s. government has taken action to limit the ability of domestic companies to engage in commerce with certain foreign entities under certain circumstances, and foreign governments may investigate our compliance with these restrictions. furthermore, given the nature of our business and our global recognizability, foreign governments may target fedex by limiting the ability of foreign entities to do business with us in certain instances, imposing monetary or other penalties or taking other retaliatory action, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as on the price of our common stock.
our transportation businesses are affected by the price and availability of jet and vehicle fuel. we must purchase large quantities of fuel to operate our aircraft and vehicles, and the price and availability of fuel is beyond our control and can be highly volatile. in addition, our purchased transportation expense is affected by fuel costs. to date, we have been mostly successful in mitigating over time the expense effect of higher fuel costs through our indexed fuel surcharges, as the amount of the surcharges is closely linked to the market prices for fuel. if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges because of competitive pricing pressures or some other reason, fuel costs could adversely affect our operating results. see "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition" of this annual report for more information. as of may 31, 2023, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations.
even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharges, high fuel surcharges could move our customers away from our higher-yielding express services to our lower-yielding deferred or ground services or even reduce customer demand for our services altogether. in addition, disruptions in the supply of fuel could have a negative effect on our ability to operate our transportation networks. the following factors may affect fuel supply and could result in shortages and price increases in the future: weather-related events; natural disasters; political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries; economic sanctions imposed against oil-producing countries or specific industry participants; changes in governmental policy concerning fuel production, transportation, taxes, or marketing; changes in refining capacity; environmental concerns; cyberattacks; and public and investor sentiment. several of these factors combined to constrain fuel supply in 2023, and we expect such conditions to continue to be present in 2024.
operating risks the failure to successfully execute our drive transformation program, including network 2.0, and our one fedex consolidation plan in the expected time frame and at the expected cost may adversely affect our future results. in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, fedex announced our drive transformation program to improve long-term profitability, including network 2.0, the multi-year effort to improve the efficiency with which fedex picks up, transports, and delivers packages in the u.s. and canada. in the fourth quarter of 2023, fedex announced one fedex, a consolidation plan to ultimately bring fedex express, fedex ground, fedex services, and other fedex operating companies into federal express corporation. see "item 1. business" and "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition" of this annual report for more information. these entities currently operate as separate and independent businesses and networks. there can be no assurances that these businesses and networks can successfully be consolidated and fully integrated as planned. it is possible that the consolidation and integration process could result in higher than currently expected costs, less-than-expected savings, the loss of customers, the disruption of ongoing businesses, union organizing, litigation, the loss of key fedex employees or service providers, or other unexpected issues. it is also possible that the overall process will take longer than currently anticipated. additionally, the following issues, among others, must be addressed in order to realize the anticipated timing and projected benefits of our drive transformation and one fedex consolidation plan:
 combining the physical networks and operations of fedex express and fedex ground, including consolidating the companies' linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations, and corporate functions;
 our ability to maintain coverage of u.s. employees at fedex express under the rla and manage challenges to the employment status of drivers employed by service providers engaged by fedex ground, in addition to other labor-related risks;
-  -
 integrating, consolidating, and implementing new administrative and back-office support functions, information-technology infrastructure, and computer systems of the respective companies;
 integrating and restructuring the corporate entities;
 integrating and unifying the offerings and services available to historical fedex express and fedex ground customers;
 harmonizing the companies' operating practices, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls, and other policies, procedures, and processes;
 maintaining existing agreements with customers and service providers and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers and service providers;
 legal challenges by fedex ground service providers or government agencies seeking to slow or stop plans related to network 2.0 or our one fedex consolidation;
 addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures, and management philosophies;
 addressing employee issues so as to promote retention and maintain efficient and effective labor and employee relations;
 maintaining access to ports of call and railroads for intermodal support;
 managing the movement of certain positions to different locations;
 obtaining any required regulatory licenses, operating authority, or contractual consents; and
 managing unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the consolidation and integration process.
we may not be able to achieve the expected operational efficiencies and network flexibility, alignment of our cost base with demand, cost savings and reductions to our permanent cost structure, and other benefits from our drive transformation and one fedex consolidation plan. the actual amount and timing of costs to be incurred and related cost savings and reductions to our permanent cost structure resulting from these initiatives and enhancements may differ from our current expectations and estimates. these initiatives and enhancements could also result in asset impairment charges and changes to our tax liabilities and deferred tax balances. if we are not able to successfully implement our drive transformation and one fedex consolidation plan, our future financial results will suffer and we may not be able to achieve our financial performance goals.
all of these factors could adversely affect fedex's results of operations and negatively affect the price of our common stock. in addition, at times the attention of certain members of our management may be focused on the drive transformation and one fedex consolidation plan and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt our business.
a significant data breach or other disruption to our technology infrastructure could disrupt our operations and result in the loss of critical confidential information, adversely affecting our reputation, business, or results of operations. our ability to attract and retain customers, efficiently operate our businesses, execute our drive transformation and one fedex consolidation plan, and compete effectively depends in part upon the sophistication, security, and reliability of our technology network, including our ability to provide features of service that are important to our customers, to protect our confidential business information and the information provided by our customers, and to maintain customer confidence in our ability to protect our systems and to provide services consistent with their expectations. for example, we rely on information technology to receive package-level information in advance of physical receipt of packages, to track items that move through our delivery systems, to efficiently plan deliveries, to clear shipments through customs, to execute billing processes, and to track and report financial and operational data. we are subject to risks imposed by data breaches and operational disruptions, including through cyberattack or cyber-intrusion, ransomware attack, or malware attack by computer hackers, foreign governments and state-sponsored actors, cyber terrorists and activists, cyber criminals, malicious employees or other insiders of fedex or third-party service providers, and other groups and individuals. data breaches and other technology disruptions of companies and governments continue to increase as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased and we, our customers, and third parties increasingly store and transmit data by means of connected information technology systems. additionally, risks such as code anomalies, "acts of god," transitional challenges in migrating operating company functionality to our fedex enterprise automation platforms, data leakage, cyber-fraud, and human error pose a direct threat to our products, services, systems, and data and could result in unauthorized or block legitimate access to sensitive or confidential data regarding our operations, customers, employees, and suppliers, including personal information.
-  -
the technology infrastructure of acquired businesses, as well as their practices related to the use and maintenance of data, could also present issues that we were not able to identify prior to the acquisition. for example, shoprunner, which we acquired in 2021, collects and stores certain personal data of its merchants and their buyers, its partners, consumers with whom it has a direct relationship, and users of its applications. additionally, it uses third-party service providers and subprocessors to help deliver services to merchants and their buyers. these service providers and subprocessors may store or access personal data, including payment information and/or other confidential information. the foregoing factors increase the risk of data incidents and the amount of potential exposure in the event of a data breach.
we also depend on and interact with the technology and systems of third parties, including our customers and third-party service providers such as cloud service providers and delivery services. such third parties may host, process, or have access to information we maintain about our company, customers, employees, and vendors or operate systems that are critical to our business operations and services. like us, these third parties are subject to risks imposed by data breaches, cyberattacks, and other events or actions that could damage, disrupt, or close down their networks or systems. we have security processes, protocols, and standards in place, including contractual provisions requiring such security measures, that are applicable to such third parties and are designed to protect information that is held by them, or to which they have access, as a result of their engagements with us. nevertheless, a cyberattack could defeat one or more of such third parties' security measures, allowing an attacker to obtain information about our company, customers, employees, and vendors or disrupt our operations. these third parties may also experience operational disruptions or human error that could result in unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data regarding our operations, customers, employees, and suppliers, including personal information.
a disruption to our complex, global technology infrastructure, including those affecting our computer systems and websites, could result in the loss of confidential business or customer information, require substantial repairs or replacements, resulting in significant costs, and lead to the temporary or permanent transfer by customers of some or all of their business to our competitors. the foregoing could harm our reputation and adversely affect our operations, customer service, and results of operations. additionally, a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created. these types of adverse effects could also occur in the event the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of company and customer information was compromised due to a data loss by fedex or a trusted third party. we or the third parties with which we share information may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs.
we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives, information-technology risk management, business continuity, and disaster recovery plans, including investments to retire and replace end-of-life systems. the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly more frequent, intense, and sophisticated. despite our efforts, we are not fully insulated from data breaches, technology disruptions, data loss, and cyber-fraud, which could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. see "item 1a. risk factors" of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended may 31, 2021 for information regarding the 2017 notpetya cyberattack at tnt express and immaterial cyber incidents we experienced in 2017 and 2018. additionally, we have experienced continual attempts by cyber criminals, some of which have been successful, to gain access to customer accounts for the purposes of fraudulently diverting and misappropriating items being transported in our network. none of these fraudulent cyber activities caused a material disruption to our systems or resulted in any material costs to fedex.
while we have significant security processes and initiatives in place, we may be unable to detect or prevent a breach or disruption in the future. additionally, while we have insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks in place, we cannot be certain that we will continue to be able to obtain excess insurance coverage in amounts we deem sufficient, our insurance carriers will pay on our insurance claims, or we will not experience a claim for which coverage is not provided. see "our business is subject to complex and evolving u.s. and foreign laws and regulations regarding data protection." below for additional information on risks related to legal and regulatory developments with respect to data protection. a significant number of our employees as well as customers and others with whom we do business continue to work remotely or in hybrid models, which may heighten these risks. these risks may also be heightened by our drive transformation, including network 2.0, and one fedex consolidation plan.
-  -
we are self-insured for certain costs associated with our operations, and insurance and claims expenses could have a material adverse effect on us. we are self-insured up to certain limits that vary by operating company and type of risk for costs associated with workers' compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and cargo loss, general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee disability programs. our self-insurance accruals are primarily based on estimated costs determined by actuarial methods. estimated costs include consideration of a variety of factors and related assumptions such as the severity of claims, frequency and volume of claims, healthcare inflation, seasonality, and plan designs, which may be subject to a high degree of variability. however, the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known, which may be several years. material increases in the magnitude of claims, changes to healthcare costs, accident frequency and severity, insurance retention levels, judgment and settlement amounts, associated legal expenses, and other factors could result in unfavorable differences between actual self-insurance costs and our reserve estimates. as a result, our insurance and claims costs could continue to increase materially which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. during 2023, higher self-insurance accruals negatively affected our results of operations. see "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition" of this annual report for more information.
as a supplement to our self-insurance program, we maintain coverage with excess insurance carriers for potential losses that exceed the amounts we self-insure. periodically, we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance levels based on risk tolerance, risk volatility, and premium expense. although we believe our aggregate insurance limits should be sufficient to cover our historic claims amounts, the commercial trucking industry has experienced a wave of blockbuster or so-called "nuclear" verdicts, including some instances in which juries have awarded hundreds of millions of dollars to those injured in accidents and their families. see note 9 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in "item 1. financial statements" of our quarterly report on form 10-q for the quarterly period ended august 31, 2022 for information regarding the 2015 jury award of approximately $160 million in compensatory damages in a lawsuit related to a vehicle accident involving a driver employed by a service provider engaged by fedex ground, subsequent court affirmation of the award in 2018 and 2022, and our pursuit of reimbursement from insurers of our payment of approximately $210 million of pre- and post-judgment interest. given this recent trend, it is possible that additional claims could exceed our aggregate coverage limits. if another claim were to exceed our aggregate insurance coverage, we would bear the excess in addition to our other self-insured amounts.
given the current claims environment, the amount of coverage available from excess insurance carriers is decreasing, the premiums for this excess coverage are increasing significantly, and excess insurance carriers are challenging insurance claims more frequently. accordingly, our excess insurance and claims expenses may continue to increase, or we could further increase our self-insured retention as policies are renewed or replaced. our results of operations and financial condition could continue to be adversely affected if our costs or losses significantly exceed our aggregate coverage limits, we are unable to obtain excess insurance coverage in amounts we deem sufficient, our insurance carriers fail to pay on our insurance claims, or we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided.
the effects of a widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease or public health crisis on our business, results of operations, and financial condition are highly unpredictable. a widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease or public health crisis, including new variants of covid-19, could have varying effects on the demand for our services, our business operations, and the global economy and supply chains. the extent of the effect of such an event on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as the global economy, will be dictated by developments that cannot be predicted, such as its duration and spread; the success of efforts to contain it and treat its effects, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, business and government shutdowns, and other restrictions; the possibility of additional subsequent widespread outbreaks and variant strains and the effect of actions taken in response; and the resulting effects on the economic conditions in the global markets in which we operate. we have now shifted to operating in a more stable post-covid-19 environment with less restrictions, which resulted in consumers returning to near pre-pandemic shopping patterns during 2023.
our business is labor and capital intensive in nature, which may require us to incur higher costs to operate our networks during such an event. if we are unable to remain agile and flex our networks to align with shipping volumes, customer needs, disrupted global supply chains and other network inefficiencies, market demands, and operating conditions, or are unable to continuously respond to evolving governmental policies, our business operations could be negatively affected, which could have a further adverse effect on our results of operations. further, due to the size, scope, and geographically dispersed nature of our operations, the expenses we incur to protect the health and safety of our team members and customers may be higher than similar expenses incurred by companies in other industries.
-  -
to the extent a widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease or public health crisis adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many other risks described in this section, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. such risks include, but are not limited to, additional changes in the state of the global economy and international trade policies and relations; our ability to execute our drive transformation and one fedex consolidation plan, implement our business strategy, and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences; our strong reputation and the value of the fedex brand; our ability to meet our labor and purchased transportation needs while controlling related costs; changes in the business and financial soundness of the usps; our ability to achieve our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040; and the effect of litigation or claims from customers, team members, suppliers, regulators, or other third parties relating to the crisis or our actions in response.
see "description of business segments - trends affecting our business" under "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition" of this annual report, as well as "item 1a. risk factors" and "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition" of our annual reports on form 10-k for the years ended may 31, 2020, may 31, 2021, and may 31, 2022, for information regarding the covid-19 pandemic and its effects on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
the transportation infrastructure continues to be a target of terrorist activities. because transportation assets continue to be a target of terrorist activities, governments around the world are adopting or are considering adopting stricter security requirements that will increase operating costs and potentially slow service for businesses, including those in the transportation industry. these security requirements are not static, but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements, imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations. for example, the tsa requires fedex express to comply with a full all-cargo aircraft operator standard security plan, which contains evolving and strict security requirements. additionally, the icao's standard that previously allowed a member state to permit carriers and other entities to determine, without government oversight, which shippers and shipments are secure for purposes of putting those shipments on all-cargo aircraft was modified effective july 1, 2021. as a result, we are now required to undertake additional security measures for international outbound shipments. it is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us or slow our service to our customers. the effects on our operations of avoiding areas of the world, including airspace, in which there are geopolitical conflicts and the targeting of aircraft by parties to those conflicts can also be significant. moreover, a terrorist attack directed at fedex or other aspects of the transportation infrastructure could disrupt our operations and adversely affect demand for our services.
strategic risks failure to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences will cause our future financial results to suffer. we are making significant investments and other decisions in connection with our long-term business strategy, such as those related to our drive transformation, including network 2.0, and one fedex consolidation plan. see "the failure to successfully execute our drive transformation, including network 2.0, and one fedex consolidation plan in the expected time frame and at the expected cost may adversely affect our future results." above and "item 1. business" and "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition" of this annual report for additional information. such initiatives and enhancements may require us to make significant capital expenditures or incur significant expenses. we have also incurred, and may continue to incur, increased operating expenses in connection with certain changes to our business strategy. we may not be able to derive the expected operational efficiencies and network flexibility, alignment of our cost base with demand, cost savings and reductions to our permanent cost structure, and other benefits from our strategic investments and other decisions.
further, in developing our business strategy, we make certain assumptions including, but not limited to, those related to customer demand and the mix of services to be purchased by our customers, the future rate of e-commerce growth and inventory restocking, passenger airline cargo capacity, competition, and the global economy, and actual market, economic, and other conditions may be different from our assumptions. as technology, customer behavior, and market conditions continue to evolve, it is important that we maintain the relevance of our brand and service offerings to our customers. if we are not able to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences, our future financial results will suffer. for additional discussion, see "item 1. business" of this annual report under the caption "strategy."
-  -
our businesses are capital intensive, and we must make capital decisions based upon projected volume levels. we make significant investments in aircraft, package handling facilities, vehicles, technology, sort equipment, acquired companies, and other assets to support our transportation and business networks. the amount and timing of capital investments depend on various factors, including our anticipated volume growth. we must make commitments to purchase or modify aircraft years before the aircraft are actually needed. we must predict volume levels and fleet requirements and make commitments for aircraft based on those projections. missing our projections could result in too much or too little capacity relative to our shipping volumes. overcapacity could lead to below-market asset dispositions or write-downs, as well as negatively affect operating margins, and undercapacity could negatively affect service levels. difficulties in quickly adjusting our operations and fixed-cost structure to match shifting volume levels, particularly at fedex express, negatively affected our results of operations in 2023. additionally, see "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition - results of operations and outlook - consolidated results - goodwill and other asset impairment charges" of this annual report for information regarding a noncash impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with our decision to permanently retire certain aircraft and related engines from service.
we depend on our strong reputation and the value of the fedex brand. the fedex brand name symbolizes high-quality service, reliability, and speed. fedex is one of the most widely recognized, trusted, and respected brands in the world, and the fedex brand is one of our most important and valuable assets. in addition, we have a strong reputation among customers, team members, and the general public for high standards of social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance and ethics. the fedex brand name and our corporate reputation are powerful sales, marketing, and recruitment tools, and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to activities by our team members or others with whom we do business, such as customer service mishaps, accidents, catastrophes, or incidents involving aircraft, vehicles, or facilities operated by us or our service providers; low safety or service levels; data breaches or technology infrastructure disruptions; noncompliance with laws and allegations or claims that result in litigation; the shipment of certain items pursuant to our obligation as a common carrier operating under federal law; labor relations and workforce reductions; our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements, or marketing programs; our political activities and expenditures; our executive compensation practices; or use of artificial intelligence could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. with the increase in the use of social media outlets such as facebook, youtube, instagram, twitter, and tiktok, adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly without context, making it increasingly difficult for us to effectively respond. certain forms of technology also allow users to alter images, videos, and other information relating to fedex and present the information in a false or misleading manner. further, our actual or perceived position or lack of position on environmental, social, political, public policy, or other sensitive issues, and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters, could harm our reputation with certain groups, including our customers, team members, governments, and regulatory bodies. damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and/or create difficulties in retaining and recruiting employee talent, and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand.
changes in the business or financial soundness of the usps, including strategic changes to its operations to reduce its reliance on the air network of fedex express, are likely to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. the usps is the largest customer of fedex express, which provides domestic air transportation services for the usps's first class mail, priority mail express, and priority mail and transportation and delivery for the usps's international delivery service. see "item 1. business" of this annual report under "fedex express segment" for more information.
pursuant to previously announced plans to restructure its operations, the usps continues to implement strategic changes to its operations to reduce its reliance on the air network of fedex express, which negatively affected our results of operations in 2023. fedex express expects lower volumes from the usps in 2024. additional changes in the usps's business, including further structural changes to its operations, network, volume levels, service offerings, service commitments, or pricing, could have additional negative effects on our revenue, results of operations, and financial condition. further, the usps's contract with fedex express for domestic services expires on september 29, 2024, and there is no assurance that the contract will be renewed on terms that are commercially acceptable to fedex. additionally, a decision by the usps to terminate the contract early could negatively affect our profitability.
-  -
we face intense competition. the transportation and business services markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in periods of little or no macroeconomic growth. some of our competitors have more financial resources and competitive advantages than we do, appear willing to operate at little or no margin to gain market share, or they are owned, controlled, or subsidized by foreign governments, which enables them to raise capital more easily. we also compete with regional transportation providers that operate smaller and less capital-intensive transportation networks and startup companies that combine technology with flexible labor solutions such as crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. in addition, some high-volume package shippers are developing and implementing in-house delivery capabilities and utilizing independent contractors for deliveries, which could in turn reduce our revenues and market share. for example, amazon.com has established a network of hubs, aircraft, and vehicles and has expressed an intention to offer its internal delivery capabilities broadly to third parties. see "item 1. business" of this annual report for additional information.
we believe we compete effectively with these companies - for example, by providing more reliable service at compensatory prices. however, the existence of an irrational pricing environment could limit our ability not only to maintain or increase our prices (including our fuel surcharges in response to rising fuel costs), but also to maintain or grow our revenues and market share. while we believe we compete effectively through our current and planned service offerings, if our current competitors or potential future competitors offer a broader range of services or better service levels, more effectively bundle their services, or offer services at lower prices, it could impede our ability to maintain or grow our market share. continued transportation industry consolidation may further increase competition. moreover, if high-volume package shippers further develop or expand internal capabilities for the services we provide, it may reduce our revenue and could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. these effects could be exacerbated if high-volume package shippers offer such capabilities to third parties. news regarding such developments or expansions could also negatively affect the price of our common stock.
additionally, advancements in technology, such as advanced safety systems; automated package sorting, handling, and delivery; autonomous delivery; third-party supply chain insight and management; artificial intelligence; vehicle platooning; alternative fuel vehicles; and digitization of freight services, may necessitate that we increase investments in order to remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing to accept higher rates to cover the cost of these investments.
our inability to execute and effectively operate, integrate, leverage, and grow acquired businesses and realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances and investments could materially adversely affect us. our strategy for long-term growth, productivity, and profitability depends in part on our ability to make prudent strategic acquisitions and investments, form joint ventures or strategic alliances, and realize the expected benefits from these transactions. we regularly acquire businesses, enter into strategic alliances, and make investments across the more than 220 countries and territories in which we provide services.
acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve special commercial, customer, accounting, regulatory, compliance, information technology, human resources, cultural, and other risks, including the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies. additionally, we may be required to make significant capital expenditures and/or incur certain operating expenses following the completion of certain transactions, which may be higher than initially expected. for example, existing and future customer data in the systems and business of fedex and shoprunner may not be ultimately interoperable, or may not be interoperable without significant added expense.
while we expect our past and future acquisitions and strategic transactions to enhance our value proposition to customers and improve our business and long-term profitability, there can be no assurance that we will realize our expectations within the time frame we have established, if at all, or that we can continue to support the value we allocate to acquired businesses, including their goodwill or other intangible assets. we have previously incurred goodwill impairment charges related to certain of our acquisitions, some of which have been material, and may incur additional goodwill impairment charges in the future. see "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition - results of operations and outlook - consolidated results - goodwill and other asset impairment charges" of this annual report for information regarding a noncash impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to the shoprunner acquisition.

human resource management risks our failure to attract and retain employee talent, meet our purchased transportation needs, or maintain our company culture, as well as increases in labor and purchased transportation costs, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our high-quality employees, many of whom are longstanding fedex team members. difficulties in motivating, rewarding, recruiting, and retaining employee talent, including successors to members of senior management; the unexpected loss of such individuals resulting in the depletion of our institutional knowledge base; and/or our inability to successfully transition key roles could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, reputation, and the price of our common stock. we also regularly seek to hire a large number of part-time and seasonal workers, and fedex ground utilizes contracted service providers to conduct its linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations.
certain positions at fedex have historically experienced high turnover rates, which can lead to increased recruiting, training, and retention costs. additionally, our company culture is important to providing high-quality customer service and having a productive workforce and could be adversely affected by our growing operations and other factors. if we fail to maintain the strength of our company culture, our competitive ability and our business may be harmed.
our business is labor intensive in nature, and our ability to meet our labor and purchased transportation needs while controlling related costs is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of qualified service providers and persons in the markets where we and our contracted service providers operate and unemployment levels within these markets, prevailing and competitive wage rates and other benefits, health and other insurance costs, inflation, fuel and energy prices and availability, behavioral changes, adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations (including increased minimum wage requirements) or government programs, safety levels of our operations, our reputation within the labor and transportation markets, changes in the business or financial soundness of service providers, interest in contracting with fedex, the effect of a widespread public health crisis, the availability of child care, and vaccine mandates that may be announced in jurisdictions in which our businesses and service providers operate. additionally, certain service providers (acting collectively or in coordination in some instances) may seek to increase financial rates or modify contract terms and may refuse to provide service to fedex in connection with such initiatives.
our inability to effectively meet our labor and purchased transportation needs can increase our costs, hinder our ability to execute our business strategy, negatively affect service levels, and adversely affect our business and results of operations. certain of these risks may be heightened by our drive transformation, including network 2.0, and one fedex consolidation plan.
labor organizations attempt to organize groups of our employees from time to time, and potential changes in labor laws could make it easier for them to do so. if we are unable to maintain positive relationships with our employees and to avoid having labor organizations organize groups of our employees, our operating costs could significantly increase and our operational flexibility could be significantly reduced. despite continual organizing attempts by labor unions, other than the pilots at fedex express and drivers at one fedex freight facility, our u.s. employees have thus far chosen not to unionize (we acquired fedex supply chain in 2015, which already had a small number of employees who are members of unions). additionally, certain of fedex express's non-u.s. employees are unionized. for information regarding the tentative successor agreement fedex express reached with the union representing the pilots of fedex express in may 2023, see "item 1. business" of this annual report under the caption "fedex express segment - fedex express - employees."
labor unions have recently attempted to organize employees at businesses and in industries that have not traditionally been unionized, and in certain instances have been successful. such attempts could continue in 2024. additionally, the u.s. congress has, in the past, considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees. for example, there is always a possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employees from the jurisdiction of the rla. additionally, this jurisdiction could be challenged in connection with our one fedex consolidation plan. for additional discussion of the rla, see "item 1. business" of this annual report under the caption "regulation." such legislation or challenge could expose our customers to the type of service disruptions that the rla was designed to prevent - local work stoppages in key areas that interrupt the timely flow of shipments of time-sensitive, high-value goods throughout our global network. such disruptions could threaten our ability to provide competitively priced shipping options and ready access to global markets.
-  -
there is also the possibility that congress could pass other labor legislation that could adversely affect our companies, such as fedex ground and fedex freight, whose employees are governed by the nlra. in addition, federal and state governmental agencies, such as the nmb and the nlrb, have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees, as well as our vendor and supplier workforces, to organize under the rla or nlra. finally, changes to federal or state laws, regulations, rules, judicial or administrative precedent, or guidance governing employee classification could affect the status of fedex ground's service providers as independent employers of drivers. if fedex ground is deemed to be an employer or joint employer of the drivers of these service providers, labor organizations could more easily organize these individuals, our operating costs could increase materially, and we could incur significant capital outlays and experience adverse effects to service levels.
fedex ground contracts with service providers to conduct its linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations, and the status of these service providers as direct and exclusive employers of drivers providing these services is being challenged. we are defending joint-employer cases where it is alleged that fedex ground should be treated as an employer or joint employer of the drivers employed by service providers engaged by fedex ground. we incur certain costs, including legal fees, in defending the status of service providers engaged by fedex ground as direct employers of their drivers. we continue to believe that fedex ground is not an employer or joint employer of the drivers of these independent businesses. however, adverse determinations in these matters or regulatory developments could, among other things, entitle service providers' drivers to certain wage payments and penalties from the service providers and fedex ground, and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for fedex ground. the status of the drivers employed by these service providers could be further challenged in connection with our one fedex consolidation plan.
proposed pilot flight and duty time regulations could impair our operations and impose substantial costs on us. in 2010, the faa proposed regulations that would change the flight and duty time rules applicable to all-cargo air carriers. when the faa issued final regulations in 2011 (the "2011 regulations"), all-cargo carriers, including fedex express, were exempt from these new requirements. instead, all-cargo carriers were required to continue complying with previously enacted flight and duty time rules and allowed to pursue the development of fatigue risk management systems to develop fatigue mitigations unique to each operation. in 2012, the faa reaffirmed the exclusion of all-cargo carriers from the 2011 regulations, and litigation in the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia affirmed the faa's decision. however, this issue remains a policy priority for certain labor groups, and the u.s. congress periodically considers legislation that, if adopted, would require all-cargo carriers to comply with the 2011 regulations. required compliance with the 2011 regulations would make it more difficult to avoid pilot fatigue and could impose substantial costs on us in order to maintain operational reliability.
increasing costs, the volatility of costs and funding requirements, and other legal mandates for employee benefits, especially pension and healthcare benefits, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. we sponsor programs that provide retirement benefits to most of our employees. these programs include defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans, and postretirement healthcare plans. the costs of providing pension and other retirement benefit plans are dependent on numerous assumptions, such as discount rates, expected long-term investment returns on plan assets, future salary increases, employee turnover, mortality, and retirement ages. changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values, as well as significant declines in the value of investments that fund our pension and other postretirement plans, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities, could increase pension and other postretirement expense, and we could be required from time to time to fund the pension plans with significant amounts of cash. such cash funding obligations could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. additionally, the rules for pension and retirement benefit plan accounting are complex, involve numerous assumptions, and can produce volatility in our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. for example, our fourth quarter mark-to-market ("mtm") retirement plans accounting adjustment resulted in a pre-tax, noncash gain of $650 million in 2023 ($493 million, net of tax, or $1.92 per diluted share) and a loss of $1.6 billion in 2022 ($1.2 billion, net of tax, or $4.49 per diluted share). for additional information on our mtm retirement plans accounting adjustments, see "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition-results of operations and outlook-consolidated results-retirement plans mtm adjustments" and note 13 of the consolidated financial statements included in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this annual report.

environmental, climate, and weather risks we may be affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory, or market responses to such change. concern over climate change, including the effect of global warming, has led to significant u.s. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit ghg emissions, including our aircraft and vehicle engine emissions. increasingly, state and local governments are also considering ghg regulatory requirements. compliance with such regulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change. increased regulation regarding ghg emissions, especially aircraft or vehicle engine emissions, could impose substantial costs on us, especially at fedex express. these costs include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital and impairment costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely. until the timing, scope, and extent of such possible regulation becomes known, we cannot predict its effect on our cost structure or our operating results. it is reasonably possible, however, that it could materially increase our operating expenses and have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business, if instituted. for additional discussion of regulatory responses to climate change, including corsia and the paris climate accord, see "item 1. business" of this annual report under the caption "regulation." we may also incur additional expenses as a result of u.s. and international regulators requiring additional disclosures regarding ghg emissions.
moreover, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services, especially our air express services. finally, given the broad and global scope of our operations and our susceptibility to global macroeconomic trends, we are particularly vulnerable to the physical risks of climate change that could affect all of humankind, such as shifts in weather patterns and world ecosystems.
we may be unable to achieve or demonstrate progress on our goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040.
in 2021, we announced a goal to achieve carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040. achievement of this goal depends on our execution of operational strategies relating to vehicle electrification; sustainable fuels; aircraft fuel conservation and fleet modernization; facilities; and sustainable customer solutions.
execution of these strategies, as well as demonstrable progress on and achievement of our calendar 2040 goal, is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and achieve the anticipated benefits and associated cost savings of such strategies and actions; the availability and cost of, and our ability to acquire, alternative fuel vehicles, alternative fuels, fuel-efficient aircraft, global electrical charging infrastructure, off-site renewable energy, and other materials and components, many of which are not presently in existence or available at scale; unforeseen production, design, operational, and technological difficulties; the outcome of research efforts and future technology developments, including the ability to scale projects and technologies on a commercially competitive basis such as carbon sequestration and/or other related processes; compliance with, and changes or additions to, global and regional regulations, taxes, charges, mandates, or requirements relating to ghg emissions, carbon costs, or climate-related goals; labor-related regulations and requirements that restrict or prohibit our ability to impose requirements on third parties who provide contracted transportation for our transportation networks; the availability of incentives to enhance the production and affordability of alternative fuel vehicles, alternative fuels, global electrical charging infrastructure, and other materials and components; adapting products to customer preferences and customer acceptance of sustainable supply chain solutions and potentially increased prices for our services; and the actions of competitors and competitive pressures.
there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute our strategies and achieve or demonstrate progress on our calendar 2040 goal of carbon neutrality for our global operations. additionally, we may determine that it is in our best interests to prioritize other business, social, governance, or sustainable investments and/or initiatives (including our drive transformation program, including network 2.0, and one fedex consolidation plan) over the achievement of our calendar 2040 goal based on economic, regulatory, or social factors, business strategy, or other reasons. failure to achieve or demonstrate progress on our calendar 2040 goal could damage our reputation and customer and other stakeholder relationships. further, given investors' and banks' increased focus related to esg matters, such a failure could cause large stockholders to reduce their ownership of fedex common stock and limit our access to financing. such conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as on the price of our common stock.
-  -
our inability to quickly and effectively restore operations following adverse weather or a localized disaster or disturbance in a key geography could adversely affect our business and results of operations. while we operate several integrated networks with assets distributed throughout the world, there are concentrations of key assets within our networks that are exposed to adverse weather conditions or localized risks from natural or manmade disasters such as earthquakes, volcanoes, wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, severe winter weather, conflicts or unrest, terrorist attacks, or other disturbances, actual or threatened. additionally, shifts in weather patterns caused by climate change could increase the frequency, severity, or duration of certain adverse weather conditions. prolonged interruptions or disruptions at a key location such as our fedex express memphis world hub or one of our information-technology centers could adversely affect our business and results of operations. we also may incur significant costs to reestablish or relocate these functions. moreover, resulting economic dislocations, including supply chain and fuel disruptions, could adversely affect demand for our services resulting in an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
other legal, regulatory, and miscellaneous risks government regulation and enforcement are evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business. we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of u.s. federal, state, and local and non-u.s. government regulations, laws, policies, and actions. there can be no assurance that such regulations, laws, policies, and actions will not be changed in ways that will decrease the demand for our services, subject us to escalating costs, or require us to modify our business models and objectives (such as our drive transformation program, including network 2.0, and one fedex consolidation plan), harming our financial results. in particular, legislative, regulatory, or other actions that u.s. and non-u.s. governments have undertaken or could take in areas such as data privacy and sovereignty, the use of new technology, taxes, foreign exchange intervention in response to currency volatility, currency controls that could restrict the movement of liquidity from particular jurisdictions, trade controls, tariffs, quotas, embargoes, or sanctions in the u.s. or other countries, complex economic sanctions, import and export controls, customs standards, additional security or workplace and transportation health and safety requirements, labor and employment standards (including with respect to our pilots), worker classification, joint employment and benefits, government contracting, regulated commodities, environmental or emission standards, and accounting may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, effective tax rate, and service levels. for additional discussion, see "item 1. business" of this annual report under the caption "regulation." additionally, the current u.s. presidential administration and various u.s. federal and state regulatory bodies have indicated a desire to reform various aspects of existing laws, regulations, and enforcement priorities and strategies that could, among other things, lead to comprehensive tax reform, broadly increase the u.s. minimum wage, make it easier for unions to organize our u.s. employees or the employees of our service providers, and alter the employment relationship between service providers engaged by fedex ground and the drivers employed by those service providers.
we could be subject to adverse changes in regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions. we are subject to taxation in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. from time to time, changes in tax laws or regulations may be enacted that could significantly affect our overall tax liabilities and our effective tax rate. u.s. and foreign governmental agencies maintain focus on the taxation of multinational companies, including statutory tax rates, global minimum taxes (such as the framework agreed to by members of the organization for economic cooperation and development in 2022), digital taxes, and transactions between affiliated companies. such changes may require new and complex computations to be performed, significant judgments, estimates, and calculations to be made, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced.
standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of certain tax laws and regulations will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation, and we may be required to make adjustments to amounts that we have recorded that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. see "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition-results of operations and outlook-consolidated results-income taxes" of this annual report for additional information regarding ongoing tax examinations and challenges. additionally, see "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition-critical accounting estimates-income taxes" of this annual report for information regarding estimates and potential adjustments related to our tax positions.

our business is subject to complex and evolving u.s. and foreign laws and regulations regarding data protection. there has recently been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus relating to the collection, use, retention, transfer, and processing of personal data in the u.s. (at both the state and federal level) and internationally, including the eu's general data protection regulation, the california privacy rights act, the virginia consumer data protection act, and other similar laws that have been or will be enacted by other jurisdictions. in addition, china and certain other jurisdictions have enacted more stringent data localization requirements. an actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable u.s. or foreign data protection laws, regulations, or other data protection standards may expose us to litigation (including, in some instances, class action litigation), fines, sanctions, or other penalties, which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. this regulatory environment is increasingly challenging, based on discretionary factors, and difficult to predict. consequently, compliance with all applicable regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we do business may present material obligations and risks to our business, including significantly expanded compliance burdens, costs, and enforcement risks; require us to make extensive system or operational changes; or adversely affect the cost or attractiveness of the services we offer. all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements, as well as the uncertain interpretation and enforcement of laws, impose significant costs and regulatory risks that are likely to increase over time. developing privacy legislation within the u.s. may also create limitations or added requirements on the use of personal data by fedex dataworks and the other fedex operating companies.
the regulatory environment for global aviation or other transportation rights may affect our operations and increase our operating costs. our extensive air network is critical to our success. our right to serve foreign points is subject to the approval of the dot and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the u.s. and foreign governments. in addition, we must obtain the permission of foreign governments to provide specific flights and services. our operations outside of the u.s., such as fedex express's international domestic operations, are also subject to current and potential regulations, including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements, that restrict, make difficult, and sometimes prohibit, the ability of foreign-owned companies such as fedex express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market. regulatory or executive actions affecting global aviation or transportation rights or a failure to obtain or maintain aviation or other transportation rights in important international markets could impair our ability to operate our networks. further, our ability to obtain or maintain aviation or other transportation rights internationally may be adversely affected by changes in international trade policies and relations.
we are subject to other extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that may result in significant costs. for instance, the faa from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require significant expenditures in order to comply. high-profile accidents, catastrophes, or incidents involving aircraft may trigger increased regulatory and legal compliance requirements. these requirements can be issued with little or no notice, or can otherwise affect our ability to efficiently or fully utilize our aircraft, and in some instances have resulted in the temporary grounding of aircraft types altogether. further, our business may be adversely affected when government agencies and air traffic control and other systems they oversee cease to operate as expected, including due to partial shutdowns, sequestrations, or similar events. lapses in government operations may result in, among other things, disruptions in the ability of government agencies to grant required regulatory approvals. for additional discussion, see "item 1. business" of this annual report under the caption "regulation."
we are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including:
 our ability to mitigate the technological, operational, legal and regulatory, and reputational risks related to autonomous technology and artificial intelligence;
 the increasing costs of compliance with federal, state, and foreign governmental agency mandates (including the foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act) and defending against inappropriate or unjustified enforcement or other actions by such agencies;
 changes in foreign currency exchange rates, especially in the euro, chinese yuan, british pound, canadian dollar, hong kong dollar, australian dollar, japanese yen, and mexican peso, which can affect our sales levels and foreign currency sales prices;
 loss or delay in the collection of accounts receivable;
 any liability resulting from and the costs of defending against class-action, derivative, and other litigation, such as wage-and-hour, joint employment, securities, vehicle accident, and discrimination and retaliation claims, claims related to our reporting and disclosure of climate change and other esg topics, and any other legal or governmental proceedings, including the matters discussed in note 18 of the consolidated financial statements included in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this annual report;
-  -
 adverse rulings on appeals and in other future judicial decisions, subsequent adverse jury findings, and changes in judicial precedent;
 the sufficiency of insurance coverage we purchase;
 the effect of technology developments on our operations and on demand for our services, and our ability to continue to identify and eliminate unnecessary information-technology redundancy and complexity throughout the organization;
 disruptions in global supply chains, which can limit the access of fedex and our service providers to vehicles and other key capital resources and increase our costs;
 difficulties experienced by the companies with which we contract to fly smaller regional "feeder" aircraft in attracting and retaining pilots, which could cause a reduction of service offered to certain locations, service disruptions, increased costs of operations, and other difficulties;
 the united kingdom's exit from the eu ("brexit"), including the economic, operational, regulatory, and financial effects of any post-brexit trade deal between the united kingdom and eu;
 governmental underinvestment in transportation infrastructure, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our service levels due to traffic congestion, prolonged closure of key thoroughfares, or sub-optimal routing of our vehicles and aircraft;
 stockholder activism, which could divert the attention of management and our board of directors from our business, hinder execution of our business strategy, give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, and cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly;
 successful completion of our planned stock repurchases; and
 constraints, volatility, or disruption in the capital markets, our ability to maintain our current credit ratings, commercial paper ratings, and senior unsecured debt and pass-through certificate credit ratings, and our ability to meet credit agreement financial covenants.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition organization of information this management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition ("md&a") of fedex corporation ("fedex" or the "company") is composed of three major sections: results of operations and outlook, financial condition, and critical accounting estimates. these sections include the following information:
•results of operations includes an overview of our consolidated 2023 results compared to 2022 results. this section also includes a discussion of key actions and events that impacted our results, as well as our outlook for 2024. discussion and analysis of 2021 results and year-over-year comparisons between 2022 results and 2021 results can be found in "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition" of our annual report on form 10-k ("annual report") for the year ended may 31, 2022.
-  -
•the overview is followed by a discussion of both historical operating results and our outlook for 2024, as well as a financial summary and analysis for each of our transportation segments.
•our financial condition is reviewed through an analysis of key elements of our liquidity and capital resources, financial commitments, and liquidity outlook for 2024.
•critical accounting estimates discusses those financial statement elements that we believe are most important to understanding the material judgments and assumptions incorporated in our financial results.
the discussion in md&a should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report, particularly "item 1. business," "item 1a. risk factors," and "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data."
description of business segments we provide a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce, and business services through companies competing collectively, operating collaboratively, and innovating digitally as one fedex. our primary operating companies are federal express corporation ("fedex express"), the world's largest express transportation company; fedex ground package system, inc. ("fedex ground"), a leading north american provider of small-package ground delivery services; and fedex freight corporation ("fedex freight"), a leading north american provider of less-than-truckload ("ltl") freight transportation services. these companies represent our major service lines and, along with fedex corporate services, inc. ("fedex services"), constitute our reportable segments. our fedex services segment provides sales, marketing, information technology, communications, customer service, technical support, billing and collection services, and certain back-office functions that support our operating segments. the operating costs of the fedex services segment are allocated to the business units it serves. see "reportable segments" for further discussion and refer to "item 1. business" for a more detailed description of each of our operating companies and information regarding our "one fedex" consolidation plan to ultimately bring fedex express, fedex ground, fedex services, and other fedex operating companies into federal express corporation.
the key indicators necessary to understand our operating results include:
•the overall customer demand for our various services based on macroeconomic factors and the global economy;
•the volumes of transportation services provided through our networks, primarily measured by our average daily volume and shipment weight and size;
•the mix of services purchased by our customers;
•the prices we obtain for our services, primarily measured by yield (revenue per package or pound or revenue per shipment or hundredweight for ltl freight shipments);
•our ability to manage our cost structure (capital expenditures and operating expenses) to match shifting volume levels; and
•the timing and amount of fluctuations in fuel prices and our ability to recover incremental fuel costs through our fuel surcharges.
trends affecting our business the following trends significantly impact the indicators discussed above, as well as our business and operating results. see the risk factors identified under part i, item 1a. "risk factors" for more information. additionally, see "results of operations and outlook - consolidated results - outlook" and "results of operations and outlook - financial condition - liquidity outlook" below for additional information on efforts we are taking to mitigate adverse trends.
macroeconomic conditions while macroeconomic risks apply to most companies, we are particularly vulnerable. the transportation industry is highly cyclical and especially susceptible to trends in economic activity. our primary business is to transport goods, so our business levels are directly tied to the purchase and production of goods and the rate of growth of global trade. our results in 2023 were adversely impacted by lower global volumes due to weak economic conditions.
covid-19 pandemic and supply chain the coronavirus ("covid-19") pandemic had varying impacts on the demand for our services and our business operations and has contributed to global supply chain disruptions. during the first half of 2023, we continued to be affected by covid-19 lockdowns in asia, which impacted both manufacturing and supply chains. we have now shifted to operating in a more stable post-covid-19
-  -
environment with less restrictions, which resulted in consumers returning to near pre-pandemic shopping patterns during 2023. as global supply chains stabilized during 2023, we experienced improvements in the availability of labor and vehicles, trailers, and other package handling equipment.
inflation and interest rates global inflation is well above historical levels, impacting all areas of our business. additionally, global interest rates continue to rise in an effort to curb inflation. we are experiencing a decline in demand for our transportation services as inflation and interest rate increases are negatively affecting consumer and business spending. additionally, we are experiencing higher costs to serve through higher fuel prices, wage rates, purchased transportation costs, and other direct operating expenses such as operational supplies. we expect inflation and high interest rates to continue to negatively affect our results in 2024.
fuel we must purchase large quantities of fuel to operate our aircraft and vehicles, and the price and availability of fuel is beyond our control and can be highly volatile. the timing and amount of fluctuations in fuel prices and our ability to recover incremental fuel costs through our fuel surcharges can significantly affect our operating results either positively or negatively in the short-term. higher fuel prices drove an increase in yields through higher fuel surcharges and an increase in fuel expense during 2023 at all of our transportation segments.
geopolitical conflicts given the nature of our business and our global operations, geopolitical conflicts may adversely affect our business and results of operations. the conflict between russia and ukraine that began in february 2022 continues as of the date of this annual report. the safety of our team members in ukraine is our top priority. as we focus on the safety of our team members, we have suspended all services in ukraine and belarus. we also temporarily idled our operations in russia and reduced our presence to the minimum required for purposes of maintaining a legal presence with active transport licenses. as a result, we incurred an immaterial amount of severance and other related expenses in 2023, which is included in business optimization expenses at fedex express. while we do not expect this conflict to have a direct material impact on our business or results of operations, the broader consequences are adversely affecting the global economy and fuel prices generally and may also have the effect of heightening other risks disclosed under part i, item 1a. "risk factors." see "results of operations and outlook - consolidated results - business optimization and realignment costs" below for additional information.
-  -
results of operations and outlook many of our operating expenses are directly affected by revenue and volume levels, and we expect these operating expenses to fluctuate on a year-over-year basis consistent with changes in revenue and volumes. therefore, the discussion of operating expense captions focuses on the key drivers and trends affecting expenses other than those factors strictly related to changes in revenue and volumes. the line item "other operating expense" includes costs associated with outside service contracts (such as temporary labor, security, and facility services and cargo handling), insurance, professional fees, operational supplies, and bad debt.
except as otherwise specified, references to years indicate our fiscal year ended may 31, 2023 or ended may 31 of the year referenced, and comparisons are to the corresponding period of the prior year. references to our transportation segments include, collectively, the fedex express segment, the fedex ground segment, and the fedex freight segment.

overview our operating results for 2023 were negatively affected by macroeconomic conditions, including inflation well above historical levels, and elevated global interest rates. in response to market conditions, we implemented cost reductions and focused on yield improvement to partially mitigate the effect of volume declines. cost reductions included reducing flight hours, temporarily parking and retiring aircraft, improving productivity, delaying and reducing certain peak wage programs, consolidating and closing sorts, canceling network capacity projects, and reducing select sunday operations. the impact of cost actions lagged volume declines, particularly in the first half of 2023 and at fedex express, resulting in elevated operating expenses relative to demand. additionally, our results in the first half of 2023 were negatively impacted by service challenges at fedex express.
operating income in 2023 includes $70 million ($54 million, net of tax, or $0.21 per diluted share) of asset impairment charges associated with the decision to permanently retire certain aircraft and related engines at fedex express, and also includes $47 million ($44 million, net of tax, or $0.17 per diluted share) of goodwill and other asset impairment charges associated with the shoprunner, inc. ("shoprunner") acquisition at fedex dataworks, inc. ("fedex dataworks"). see the "goodwill and other asset impairment charges" section of this md&a for more information.
operating income in 2023 includes $273 million ($209 million, net of tax, or $0.81 per diluted share) of expenses associated with our drive business optimization strategy announced in the first quarter of 2023, and also includes business realignment costs of $36 million ($27 million, net of tax, or $0.11 per diluted share) associated with our workforce reduction plan in europe announced in 2021. operating income in 2022 includes $278 million ($214 million, net of tax, or $0.80 per diluted share) of costs under this program. see the "business optimization and realignment costs" section of this md&a for more information.
operating income includes a $35 million charge ($26 million, net of tax, or $0.10 per diluted share) in 2023 related to a fedex ground legal matter and a $210 million charge ($160 million, net of tax, or $0.60 per diluted share) in 2022 related to pre- and post-judgment interest in connection with a separate fedex ground legal matter. the amounts are included in "corporate, other, and eliminations."
operating expenses in 2022 include $132 million ($103 million, net of tax, or $0.39 per diluted share) of tnt express integration expenses.
net income includes a pre-tax, noncash gain of $650 million in 2023 ($493 million, net of tax, or $1.92 per diluted share) and a loss of $1.6 billion in 2022 ($1.2 billion, net of tax, or $4.49 per diluted share) associated with our mtm retirement plans accounting adjustments. see the "retirement plans mtm adjustments" section of this md&a and note 13 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
net income in 2023 includes a $46 million ($0.18 per diluted share) tax expense from a revaluation of certain foreign tax assets. in 2022, we recognized a $142 million ($0.53 per diluted share) tax benefit related to revisions of prior-year tax estimates for actual tax return results. see the "income taxes" section of this md&a and note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
in december 2021, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $5 billion of fedex common stock. as part of the repurchase program, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase ("asr") agreement with a bank in october 2022, which was completed in december 2022, to repurchase an aggregate of $1.5 billion of our common stock. share repurchases had a benefit of $0.34 per diluted share in 2023. see note 1 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the "financial condition-liquidity" section of this md&a for additional information on our stock repurchase program.

revenue revenue decreased 4% in 2023 primarily due to global volume declines at all of our transportation segments, partially offset by yield improvement, including higher fuel surcharges.
fedex express revenue decreased 7% in 2023 due to lower global volume and unfavorable foreign currency, partially offset by yield improvement, including higher fuel surcharges. revenue at corporate, other, and eliminations decreased due to lower yields and volumes at fedex trade networks transport & brokerage, inc. fedex ground revenue and fedex freight revenue each increased 1% in 2023, primarily due to yield improvement, including higher fuel surcharges, partially offset by lower volume.
goodwill and other asset impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2023, we made the decision to permanently retire from service 12 boeing md-11f aircraft and 25 related engines, four boeing 757-200 aircraft and one related engine, and two airbus a300-600 aircraft and eight related engines, to align with the plans of fedex express to modernize its aircraft fleet, improve its global network, and better align air network capacity to match current and anticipated shipment volumes. as a consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment charge of $70 million ($54 million, net of tax, or $0.21 per diluted share) was recorded in the fourth quarter. all of these aircraft were temporarily idled and not in revenue service.
in the fourth quarter of 2023, we also recorded a noncash impairment charge of $36 million ($36 million, net of tax, or $0.14 per diluted share) for all of the goodwill attributable to fedex dataworks. the key factors contributing to the goodwill impairment were underperformance of the shoprunner business during 2023, including base business erosion, and the failure to attain the level of operating synergies and revenue and profit growth anticipated at the time of acquisition. based on these factors, our outlook for the business changed in the fourth quarter of 2023. we also recorded an $11 million ($8 million, net of tax, or $0.03 per diluted share) noncash intangible asset impairment charge related to the shoprunner acquisition at fedex dataworks. for additional information regarding these impairment charges, see the "critical accounting estimates" section of this md&a and note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
business optimization and realignment costs in the second quarter of 2023, fedex announced drive, a comprehensive program to improve the company's long-term profitability. this program includes a business optimization plan to drive efficiency among our transportation segments and lower our overhead and support costs. we plan to consolidate our sortation facilities and equipment, reduce pickup-and-delivery routes, and optimize our enterprise linehaul network by moving beyond discrete collaboration to an end-to-end optimized network through network 2.0.
in the fourth quarter of 2023, we announced one fedex, a consolidation plan to ultimately bring fedex express, fedex ground, fedex services, and other fedex operating companies into federal express corporation, becoming a single company operating a unified, fully integrated air-ground network under the respected fedex brand. fedex freight will continue to provide ltl freight transportation services as a stand-alone and separate company under federal express corporation. the organizational redesign will be implemented in phases with full implementation expected in june 2024. one fedex will help facilitate our drive transformation program to improve long-term profitability.
we have announced the implementation of network 2.0 in more than 20 markets, including the phased transition of all fedex ground operations and personnel in canada to fedex express beginning in april 2024. under network 2.0, fedex will continue to utilize both employees and contracted service providers.
we incurred costs associated with our business optimization activities of $273 million ($209 million, net of tax, or $0.81 per diluted share) in 2023. these costs were primarily related to consulting services, severance, professional fees, and idling our operations in russia. these business optimization costs are included in corporate, other, and eliminations and fedex express. the identification of these costs as business optimization-related expenditures is subject to our disclosure controls and procedures. we expect the pre-tax cost of our business optimization activities to be approximately $500 million in 2024 and approximately $2.0 billion through 2025. the timing and amount of our business optimization expenses may change as we revise and implement our plans.
in 2021, fedex express announced a workforce reduction plan in europe related to the network integration of tnt express. the plan affected approximately 5,000 employees in europe across operational teams and back-office functions and was completed during 2023. we incurred costs of $36 million ($27 million, net of tax, or $0.11 per diluted share) in 2023 and $278 million ($214 million, net of tax, or $0.80 per diluted share) in 2022 associated with our business realignment activities. these costs are related to certain employee severance arrangements. payments under this program totaled approximately $118 million in 2023 and approximately $225 million in 2022. the pre-tax cost of our business realignment activities was approximately $430 million through 2023. we expect savings from our business realignment activities to be approximately $275 million on an annualized basis beginning in 2024.

operating income declined in 2023 primarily due to lower volumes at each of our transportation segments, partially offset by yield improvement, including higher fuel surcharges. cost reduction efforts such as reducing flight hours, temporarily parking and retiring aircraft, improving productivity, delaying and reducing certain peak wage programs, consolidating and closing sorts, canceling network capacity projects, and reducing select sunday operations partially mitigated the effects of volume declines on our results.
global inflation drove higher operating expenses related to salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses in 2023. in addition, higher self-insurance and bad debt accruals contributed to an increase in other operating expense in 2023.
we recognized $70 million of asset impairment charges associated with the decision to permanently retire certain aircraft and related engines at fedex express. our 2023 results also include $47 million of goodwill and other asset impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2023 associated with the shoprunner acquisition at fedex dataworks. for additional information regarding these impairment charges, see the "goodwill and other asset impairment charges" and "critical accounting estimates" sections of this md&a and note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
fuel we apply a fuel surcharge on our air and ground services, most of which are adjusted on a weekly basis. the fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from ten days prior to the week in which it is assessed. some fedex express international fuel surcharges are updated on a monthly basis. we routinely review our fuel surcharges and periodically update the tables used to determine our fuel surcharges at all of our transportation segments.
while fluctuations in fuel surcharge percentages can be significant from period to period, fuel surcharges represent one of the many individual components of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield. additional components include the mix of services sold, the base price, and extra service charges we obtain for these services and level of pricing discounts offered.
fuel expense increased 16% during 2023 due to higher fuel prices, partially offset by a decline in fuel usage. in addition to variability in usage and market prices, the manner in which we purchase fuel also influences our results. for example, our contracts for jet fuel purchases at fedex express are tied to various indices, including the u.s. gulf coast index. while many of these indices are aligned, each index may fluctuate at a different pace, driving variability in the prices paid for jet fuel. furthermore, under these contractual arrangements, approximately 70% of our jet fuel is purchased based on the index price for the preceding week, with the remainder of our purchases tied primarily to the index price for the preceding month and preceding day, rather than based on daily spot rates. these contractual provisions mitigate the impact of rapidly changing daily spot rates on our jet fuel purchases.
-  -
because of the factors described above, our operating results may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharges, which can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the short-term. for more information, see "item 1a. risk factors."
other income and expense other retirement plans income (expense) increased primarily due to a noncash mtm gain of $650 million in 2023 compared to a $1.6 billion loss in 2022 (described below). in addition, interest income increased $145 million in 2023 primarily due to an increase in interest rates, partially offset by a decrease in other income of $120 million related to changes in the value of equity investments.
retirement plans mtm adjustments in 2023, we incurred a pre-tax, noncash mtm gain of $650 million ($493 million, net of tax, or $1.92 per diluted share), related to the year-end actuarial adjustments of pension and postretirement healthcare plans' assets and liabilities. these actuarial adjustments were due to higher discount rates, partially offset by lower than expected asset returns and demographic experience.
in 2022, we incurred a pre-tax, noncash mtm loss of $1.6 billion ($1.2 billion, net of tax, or $4.49 per diluted share), which includes a net loss of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion, net of tax, or $3.76 per diluted share) related to the year-end actuarial adjustments of pension and postretirement healthcare plans' assets and liabilities. these actuarial adjustments were due to lower than expected asset returns, demographic experience, and an update to the mortality assumption, partially offset by higher discount rates.
additionally, in 2022, we incurred a pre-tax, noncash mtm net loss of $260 million ($195 million, net of tax, or $0.73 per diluted share) in the second quarter of 2022, of which $224 million was related to the termination of the tnt express netherlands pension plan. effective october 1, 2021, the responsibility of all pension assets and liabilities of this plan was transferred to a separate, multi-employer pension plan. the remaining $36 million net loss was related to the u.s. fedex freight pension plan and consisted of a $75 million mtm loss due to a lower discount rate in the second quarter of 2022, partially offset by a $39 million curtailment gain.
for more information, see the "critical accounting estimates" section of this md&a and note 1 and note 13 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
income taxes our effective tax rate was 25.9% for 2023, compared to 21.9% for 2022. the 2023 tax provision was negatively impacted by an expense of $46 million related to a write-down and valuation allowance on certain foreign tax credit carryforwards due to operational changes which impacted the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax asset. the 2023 tax provision was also negatively impacted by lower earnings in certain non-u.s. jurisdictions.
the 2022 tax provision includes a benefit of $142 million related to revisions of prior year tax estimates for actual tax return results. the 2022 tax provision was also favorably impacted by changes in our corporate legal entity structure.
we are subject to taxation in the u.s. and various u.s. state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. we are currently under examination by the internal revenue service ("irs") for the 2016 through 2019 tax years. it is reasonably possible that certain income tax return proceedings will be completed during the next 12 months and could result in a change in our balance of unrecognized tax benefits. however, we believe we have recorded adequate amounts of tax, including interest and penalties, for any adjustments expected to occur.
during 2021, we filed suit in u.s. district court for the western district of tennessee challenging the validity of a tax regulation related to the one-time transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings, which was enacted as part of the tax cuts and jobs act ("tcja"). our lawsuit seeks to have the court declare this regulation invalid and order the refund of overpayments of u.s. federal income taxes for 2018 and 2019 attributable to the denial of foreign tax credits under the regulation. we have recorded a cumulative benefit of $223 million through 2023 attributable to our interpretation of the tcja and the internal revenue code. on march 31, 2023, the district court ruled that the regulation is invalid and contradicts the plain terms of the tax code. we continue to work towards obtaining a final judgment for the applicable refund amounts due to the regulation being invalid. once the district court enters a final judgment, the u.s. government could file an appeal with the u.s. court of appeals for the sixth circuit. if we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our position, we may be required to reverse the benefit previously recorded.
for more information on income taxes, see the "critical accounting estimates" section of this md&a and note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
-  -
equity investment as of may 31, 2023, we do not have any equity investments that are material to our financial position or results of operations. for more information on equity investments, see note 1 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
outlook during 2024, we expect macroeconomic conditions to continue to negatively impact customer demand for our services. however, we expect operating income improvement in 2024 as a result of our drive program initiatives focused on aligning our cost base with demand, reducing our permanent cost structure, and increasing the flexibility of our network. we expect international export yield declines and reduced customer demand for our u.s. freight product at fedex express to negatively impact revenue and operating income in 2024. in addition, we expect expense headwinds in 2024 related to higher global inflation and variable incentive compensation.
see the "business optimization and realignment costs" section of this md&a for additional information on our drive program and other cost savings initiatives.
our capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be approximately $5.7 billion, a decrease of $0.5 billion from 2023, as we continue to reduce our capital intensity relative to revenue. we expect lower aircraft spend and reduced capacity investment to be partially offset by investments to optimize our networks and modernize our facilities. our expected capital expenditures for 2024 include our continued investments in the expansion and modernization of the fedex express indianapolis hub and modernization of the fedex express memphis world hub.
we will continue to evaluate our investments in critical long-term strategic projects to ensure our capital expenditures are expected to generate high returns on investment and are balanced with our outlook for global economic conditions. for additional details on key 2024 capital projects, refer to the "financial condition - capital resources" and "financial condition - liquidity outlook" sections of this md&a.
the uncertainty of a slowing global economy, global inflation well above historical levels, geopolitical challenges including the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine, and the impact these factors will have on the rate of growth of global trade, supply chains, fuel prices, and our business in particular, make any expectations for 2024 inherently less certain. see "item 1a. risk factors" for more information.
see "forward-looking statements", "item 1a. risk factors", "trends affecting our business", and "critical accounting estimates" for a discussion of these and other potential risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our future performance.
seasonality of business our businesses are cyclical in nature, as seasonal fluctuations affect volumes, revenue, and earnings. historically, the u.s. express package business experiences an increase in volumes in late november and december. international business, particularly in the asia-to-u.s. market, peaks in october and november in advance of the u.s. holiday sales season. our first and third fiscal quarters, because they are summer vacation and post winter-holiday seasons, have historically experienced lower volumes relative to other periods. normally, the fall is the busiest shipping period for fedex ground, while late december, june and july are the slowest periods. for fedex freight, the spring and fall are the busiest periods and the latter part of december through february is the slowest period. shipment levels, operating costs, and earnings for each of our companies can also be adversely affected by inclement weather, particularly the impact of severe winter weather in our third fiscal quarter. see "item 1a. risk factors" for more information.
recent accounting guidance see note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting guidance.

in the fourth quarter of 2023, fedex announced one fedex, a consolidation plan to ultimately bring fedex express, fedex ground, fedex services, and other fedex operating companies into federal express corporation, becoming a single company operating a unified, fully integrated air-ground network under the respected fedex brand. the organizational redesign will be implemented in phases with full implementation expected in june 2024. during the implementation process in fiscal 2024, each of our current reportable segments will continue to have discrete financial information that will be regularly reviewed when evaluating performance and making resource allocation decisions, and aligns with our management reporting structure and our internal financial reporting. in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, when the consolidation plan has been completed, we expect to begin reporting a resegmented structure that will align with an updated management reporting structure and how management will evaluate performance and make resource allocation decisions under one fedex.
fedex services segment the fedex services segment provides direct and indirect support to our operating segments, and we allocate all of the net operating costs of the fedex services segment to reflect the full cost of operating our businesses in the results of those segments. we review and evaluate the performance of our transportation segments based on operating income (inclusive of fedex services segment allocations). for the fedex services segment, performance is evaluated based on the effect of its total allocated net operating costs on our operating segments.
operating expenses for each of our transportation segments include the allocations from the fedex services segment to the respective transportation segments. these allocations include charges and credits for administrative services provided between operating companies. the allocations of net operating costs are based on metrics such as relative revenue or estimated services provided. we believe these allocations approximate the net cost of providing these functions. our allocation methodologies are refined periodically, as necessary, to reflect changes in our businesses.
corporate, other, and eliminations corporate and other includes corporate headquarters costs for executive officers and certain legal and finance functions, including certain other costs and credits not attributed to our core business, as well as certain costs associated with developing our "innovate digitally" strategic pillar through our fedex dataworks operating segment. fedex dataworks is focused on creating solutions to transform the digital and physical experiences of our customers and team members. shoprunner, inc. was merged into fedex dataworks during 2023.
also included in corporate and other is the fedex office and print services, inc. operating segment, which provides an array of document and business services and retail access to our customers for our package transportation businesses, and the fedex logistics, inc. operating segment, which provides integrated supply chain management solutions, specialty transportation, customs brokerage, and global ocean and air freight forwarding.
the results of corporate, other, and eliminations are not allocated to the other business segments.
-  -
in 2023, the decrease in operating results in corporate, other, and eliminations was primarily due to lower operating income at fedex logistics due to decreased revenue and an increase in bad debt, partially offset by decreased purchased transportation expense. additionally, operating results in corporate, other, and eliminations were negatively impacted by higher professional fees and outside service contract spend at fedex dataworks. the comparison of operating loss between 2023 and 2022 at corporate, other, and eliminations is affected by goodwill and other asset impairment charges of $47 million associated with the shoprunner acquisition at fedex dataworks in 2023.
certain fedex operating companies provide transportation and related services for other fedex companies outside their reportable segment in order to optimize our resources. for example, during 2023 fedex ground provided delivery support for certain fedex express packages as part of our last-mile optimization efforts, and fedex freight provided road and intermodal support for both fedex ground and fedex express. in addition, fedex express is working with fedex logistics to secure air charters and other cargo space for u.s. customers. billings for such services are based on negotiated rates, which we believe approximate fair value, and are reflected as revenue of the billing segment. these rates are adjusted from time to time based on market conditions. such intersegment revenue and expenses are eliminated in our consolidated results and are not separately identified in the following segment information because the amounts are not material.

(1)international domestic statistics relate to our international intra-country operations.
fedex express segment revenue fedex express segment revenue decreased 7% in 2023 primarily due to decreased global volume and unfavorable exchange rates, partially offset by yield improvement.
total average daily package volume decreased 10% in 2023, and total average daily freight pounds decreased 14% in 2023, due to reduced demand for our services, primarily resulting from macroeconomic conditions. volume declines were partially offset by yield improvement, including increases in composite package yield of 6% and composite freight yield of 2% in 2023. the 6% increase in composite package yield was primarily due to a u.s. domestic package yield increase of 12%, driven by higher base yields and fuel surcharges. unfavorable exchange rates negatively impacted all international package and freight product yields in 2023.
fedex express segment operating income fedex express segment operating income decreased 64% in 2023 primarily due to global volume declines, partially offset by yield improvement and lower operating expenses. during 2023, we implemented cost reductions to mitigate the impact of volume declines, including reducing flight hours, temporarily parking and retiring aircraft, improving productivity, and consolidating routes and closing sorts. the impact of these reductions, while improving throughout the year, lagged volume declines, and operating expenses remained high relative to demand. currency exchange rates had a negative effect on revenue and a positive effect on expenses, resulting in a slightly negative effect on operating income in 2023.
- 59 -
fuel expense increased 16% in 2023 due to a 27% increase in fuel prices, partially offset by a 9% decline in total fuel gallons. purchased transportation expense decreased 11% in 2023 primarily due to favorable exchange rates and lower utilization, partially offset by higher rates charged by third-party providers. salaries and employee benefits expense decreased 3% in 2023 primarily due to decreased staffing to align with lower volume, favorable currency exchange rates, and lower variable incentive compensation, partially offset by increased wage rates. rentals and landing fees expense decreased 10% in 2023 primarily due to decreased aircraft leases and favorable currency exchange rates. other operating expense decreased 2% in 2023 primarily due to favorable currency exchange rates and lower outside service contract expense, partially offset by higher bad debt expense. maintenance and repairs expense decreased 6% in 2023 primarily due to lower aircraft maintenance resulting from an increase in aircraft temporarily parked.
during 2023, we recorded asset impairment charges of $70 million associated with the decision to permanently retire certain aircraft and related engines. see "goodwill and other asset impairment charges" above for more information. additionally, fedex express segment results include business realignment costs of $36 million in 2023 associated with our workforce reduction plan in europe. we recognized $278 million of costs in 2022 under this program. fedex express segment results also include business optimization costs of $11 million in 2023, which includes costs associated with idling our business in russia. see the "business optimization and realignment costs" section of this md&a for more information.
fedex express segments results include $115 million of tnt express integration expenses in 2022.

fedex ground segment operating income fedex ground segment operating income increased 19% in 2023 primarily due to yield improvement, including higher fuel surcharges, partially offset by lower volume and higher other operating and rentals expense. the 2023 results benefited from certain cost reductions to mitigate the effect of volume declines, primarily a delay and reduction in peak wage programs, the consolidation and closing of certain sort and linehaul operations, cancellation of network capacity projects, and reduced sunday delivery coverage.
purchased transportation expense decreased 4% in 2023 primarily due to lower volumes, partially offset by lower productivity and higher fuel prices. salaries and employee benefits decreased 5% in 2023 primarily due to decreased staffing to align with lower volume and lower variable incentive compensation, partially offset by higher wage rates. other operating expense increased 11% in 2023 primarily due to higher self-insurance accruals and higher outside service contracts expense. rentals and depreciation expense increased 18% and 11%, respectively, in 2023 due to the completion of previously committed multi-year expansion projects.

capital expenditures decreased $0.6 billion during 2023 primarily due to decreased spending on aircraft and related equipment at fedex express.
guarantor financial information we are providing the following information in compliance with rule 13-01 of regulation s-x, "financial disclosures about guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities" with respect to our senior unsecured debt securities and pass-through certificates, series 2020-1aa (the "certificates").
the $19.2 billion principal amount of the senior unsecured notes were issued by fedex under a shelf registration statement and are guaranteed by certain direct and indirect subsidiaries of fedex ("guarantor subsidiaries"). fedex owns, directly or indirectly, 100% of each guarantor subsidiary. the guarantees are (1) unsecured obligations of the respective guarantor subsidiary, (2) rank equally with all of their other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, and (3) are full and unconditional and joint and several. if we sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of all of the capital stock or all or substantially all of the assets of a guarantor subsidiary to any person that is not an affiliate of fedex, the guarantee of that guarantor subsidiary will terminate, and holders of debt securities will no longer have a direct claim against such subsidiary under the guarantee.

liquidity outlook in response to current business and economic conditions as referenced above in the "outlook" section of this md&a, we are continuing to actively manage and optimize our capital allocation to mitigate the impact of the slowing economy, inflationary pressures, and geopolitical conflicts. we held $6.9 billion in cash at may 31, 2023 and have $3.5 billion in available liquidity under our $2.0 billion five-year credit agreement (the "five-year credit agreement) and $1.5 billion three-year credit agreement (the "three-year credit agreement" and together with the five-year credit agreement, the "credit agreements"), and we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, and available financing sources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs, which include operational requirements, expected capital expenditures, voluntary pension contributions, dividend payments, and stock repurchases.
-  -
as announced on june 20, 2023, we expect to repurchase $2.0 billion of our common stock in 2024. we executed an asr agreement with a bank in june 2023 to repurchase an aggregate of $500 million of our common stock with a completion date no later than august 2023.
our cash and cash equivalents balance at may 31, 2023 includes $2.6 billion of cash in foreign jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy. we are able to access the majority of this cash without a material tax cost and do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds impairs our ability to meet our u.s. domestic debt or working capital obligations.
our capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be approximately $5.7 billion, a decrease of $0.5 billion from 2023, as we continue to reduce our capital intensity relative to revenue. we expect lower aircraft spend and reduced capacity investment to be partially offset by investments to optimize our networks and modernize our facilities. included within our expected 2024 capital expenditures are our continued investments in the expansion and modernization of the fedex express indianapolis hub and modernization of the fedex express memphis world hub, which are expected to total $1.5 billion each over the life of each project. our expected capital expenditures for 2024 also include $1.5 billion for delivery of aircraft and related equipment and progress payments toward future aircraft deliveries at fedex express.
we have additional obligations as part of our ordinary course of business, beyond those committed for capital expenditures, which consist of debt obligations, lease obligations, and obligations and commitments for purchases of goods and services. refer to note 6, note 7, and note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information. in addition, we have certain tax positions that are further discussed in note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. we do not have any guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.
we have several aircraft modernization programs under way that are supported by the purchase of boeing 777 freighter and boeing 767-300 freighter aircraft. these aircraft are significantly more fuel-efficient per unit than the aircraft types previously utilized, and these expenditures are necessary to achieve significant long-term operating savings and to replace older aircraft. our ability to delay the timing of these aircraft-related expenditures is limited without incurring significant costs to modify existing purchase agreements.
we have a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission ("sec") that allows us to sell, in one or more future offerings, any combination of our unsecured debt securities and common stock and allows pass-through trusts formed by fedex express to sell, in one or more future offerings, pass-through certificates.
the five-year credit agreement expires in march 2026 and includes a $250 million letter of credit sublimit. the three-year credit agreement expires in march 2025. the credit agreements are available to finance our operations and other cash flow needs. see note 6 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of the terms and significant covenants of the credit agreements.
we made a voluntary contribution of $200 million to our tax-qualified u.s. domestic pension plans ("u.s. pension plans") in june 2023 and anticipate making $600 million of additional voluntary contributions during the remainder of 2024. there are currently no required minimum contributions to our u.s. pension plans based on current funded status and credit balance due to cumulative excess voluntary pension contributions, which exceeds $3.0 billion. the credit balance is subtracted from plan assets to determine the minimum funding requirements. therefore, we could eliminate all required contributions to our principal u.s. pension plans for several years if we were to choose to waive part of that credit balance in any given year. our u.s. pension plans have ample funds to meet expected benefit payments.
on april 5, 2023, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.26 per share of common stock. the dividend was paid on july 3, 2023 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on june 12, 2023. each quarterly dividend payment is subject to review and approval by our board of directors, and we evaluate our dividend payment amount on an annual basis. there are no material restrictions on our ability to declare dividends, nor are there any material restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in the form of cash dividends, loans, or advances.
standard & poor's has assigned us a senior unsecured debt credit rating of bbb, a certificates rating of aa-, a commercial paper rating of a-2, and a ratings outlook of "stable." moody's investors service has assigned us an unsecured debt credit rating of baa2, a certificates rating of aa3, a commercial paper rating of p-2, and a ratings outlook of "stable." if our credit ratings drop, our interest expense may increase. if our commercial paper ratings drop below current levels, we may have difficulty utilizing the commercial paper market. if our senior unsecured debt credit ratings drop below investment grade, our access to financing may become limited.

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements. in many cases, there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used. we maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements of a complex, global corporation. however, even under optimal circumstances, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and new or better information.
the estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to our results of operations and financial condition. management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit and finance committee of our board of directors and with our independent registered public accounting firm.
retirement plans the rules for pension accounting are complex and can produce volatility in our earnings, financial condition, and liquidity. our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are measured using actuarial techniques that reflect management's assumptions for expected returns on assets ("eroa"), discount rate, and demographic experience such as salary increases, expected retirement, mortality, employee turnover, and future increases in healthcare costs. differences between these assumptions and actual experience are recognized in our earnings through mtm accounting. the components of the mtm adjustments for the period ended may 31 are as follows (presented as (gain) loss in millions):
2023                   2022

our annual mtm adjustment is highly sensitive to the discount rate and eroa assumptions, which are as follows:

income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our income taxes are a function of our income, tax planning opportunities available to us, statutory tax rates, and the income tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by us and the respective governmental taxing authorities. as a result, significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. also, our effective tax rate is significantly affected by the earnings generated in each jurisdiction, so unexpected fluctuations in the geographic mix of earnings could significantly impact our tax rate. our intercompany transactions are based on globally accepted transfer pricing principles, which align profits with the business operations and functions of the various legal entities in our international business.
we evaluate our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. these evaluations are based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax laws or their interpretations, audit activity, and changes in our business. in addition, management considers the advice of third parties in making conclusions regarding tax consequences.
tax contingencies arise from uncertainty in the application of tax rules throughout the many jurisdictions in which we operate. despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, taxing authorities could challenge certain positions. we record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon management's evaluation of the information available at the reporting date. to be recognized in the financial statements, a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on the technical merits. the benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon settlement.
deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, and available tax planning strategies. these sources of income rely heavily on estimates to make this determination, and as a result there is a risk that these estimates will have to be revised as new information is received. to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. we believe we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets that are not subject to valuation allowances. we record the taxes for global intangible low-taxed income as a period cost.
our income tax positions are based on currently enacted tax laws. as further guidance is issued by the u.s. treasury department, the irs, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes to our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance.
for more information, see the "income taxes" section of this md&a and note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
self-insurance accruals our self-insurance reserves are established for estimates of ultimate loss on all incurred claims, including incurred-but-not-reported claims. components of our self-insurance reserves included in this critical accounting estimate are workers' compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and cargo loss, general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee disability programs. these reserves are primarily based on the actuarially estimated cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. these estimates include judgment about severity of claims, frequency and volume of claims, healthcare inflation, seasonality, and plan designs. the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claims involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known, which may be several years.
we believe our recorded obligations for these expenses are consistently measured on a conservative basis. nevertheless, changes in accident frequency and severity, healthcare costs, insurance retention levels, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities and affect our results of operations. self-insurance accruals reflected in our balance sheet for the period ended may 31 are as follows (in millions):
2023              2022
short-term            $1,730            $1,646
long-term              3,339             2,889
total                 $5,069            $4,535
-  -
a five-percent reduction or improvement in the assumed claim severity used to estimate our self-insurance accruals would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $250 million in our reserves and expenses as of and for the year ended may 31, 2023. for more information, see "item 1a. risk factors" of this annual report.
long-lived assets useful lives and salvage values. our business is capital intensive, with approximately 60% of our owned assets invested in our transportation and information system infrastructures.
the depreciation or amortization of our capital assets over their estimated useful lives, and the determination of any salvage values, requires management to make judgments about future events. because we utilize many of our capital assets over relatively long periods (the majority of aircraft costs are depreciated over 15 to 30 years), we periodically evaluate whether adjustments to our estimated service lives or salvage values are necessary to ensure these estimates properly match the economic use of the asset. these evaluations consider usage, maintenance costs, and economic factors that affect the useful life of an asset. this evaluation may result in changes in the estimated lives and residual values used to depreciate our aircraft and other equipment.
for our aircraft, we consider actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types and future volume projections in estimating the useful lives and expected salvage values. we typically assign no residual value due to the utilization of our aircraft in cargo configuration, which results in little to no value at the end of their useful life. these estimates affect the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and, ultimately, the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset. changes in the estimated lives of assets will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future periods and could have a material impact on our results of operations (as described below). historically, gains and losses on disposals of operating equipment have not been material. however, such amounts may differ materially in the future due to changes in business levels, technological obsolescence, accident frequency, regulatory changes, and other factors beyond our control.
impairment. as of may 31, 2023, the fedex express global air network included a fleet of 700 aircraft (including 293 supplemental aircraft) that provide delivery of packages and freight to more than 220 countries and territories through a wide range of u.s. and international shipping services. while certain aircraft are utilized in primary geographic areas (u.s. versus international), we operate an integrated global network, and utilize our aircraft and other modes of transportation to achieve the lowest cost of delivery while maintaining our service commitments to our customers. because of the integrated nature of our global network, our aircraft are interchangeable across routes and geographies, giving us flexibility with our fleet planning to meet changing global economic conditions and maintain and modify aircraft as needed.
because of the lengthy lead times for aircraft manufacture and modifications, we must anticipate volume levels and plan our fleet requirements years in advance, and make commitments for aircraft based on those projections. furthermore, the timing and availability of certain used aircraft types (particularly those with better fuel efficiency) may create limited opportunities to acquire these aircraft at favorable prices in advance of our capacity needs. these activities create risks that asset capacity may exceed demand. at may 31, 2023, we had three purchased aircraft that were not yet placed into service.
we evaluate our long-lived assets used in operations for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by that asset group are less than the carrying amounts of the asset group and may not be recoverable. if the cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, the asset must be adjusted to its current fair value. we operate integrated transportation networks, and accordingly, cash flows for most of our operating assets are assessed at a network level, not at an individual asset level for our analysis of impairment. further, decisions about capital investments are evaluated based on the impact to the overall network rather than the return on an individual asset. we make decisions to remove certain long-lived assets from service based on projections of reduced capacity needs or lower operating costs of newer aircraft types, and those decisions may result in an impairment charge. assets held for disposal must be adjusted to their estimated fair values less costs to sell when the decision is made to dispose of the asset and certain other criteria are met. the fair value determinations for such aircraft may require management estimates, as there may not be active markets for some of these aircraft. such estimates are subject to revision from period to period.
in the fourth quarter of 2023, we made the decision to permanently retire from service 12 boeing md-11f aircraft and 25 related engines, four boeing 757-200 aircraft and one related engine, and two airbus a300-600 aircraft and eight related engines, to align with the plans of fedex express to modernize its aircraft fleet, improve its global network, and better align air network capacity to match current and anticipated shipment volumes. as a consequence of this decision, a noncash impairment charge of $70 million ($54 million, net of tax, or $0.21 per diluted share) was recorded in the fourth quarter. all of these aircraft were temporarily idled and not in revenue service.
in addition, in the fourth quarter of 2023, fedex express made the decision to accelerate the retirement of 46 md-11f aircraft and related engines to aid in our fleet modernization, improve our global network, and better align air network capacity of fedex express to match current and anticipated shipment volumes. as a result of this decision, we expect a net increase of approximately $12 million in depreciation expense in 2024 with the expense impact in 2025 being immaterial.
-  -
in the normal management of our aircraft fleet, we routinely idle aircraft and engines temporarily due to maintenance cycles and adjustments of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand levels. temporarily idled assets are classified as available-for-use, and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these assets. these temporarily idled assets are assessed for impairment and remaining life on a quarterly basis. the criteria for determining whether an asset has been permanently removed from service (and, as a result, is potentially impaired) include, but are not limited to, our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume levels, including capacity needs during our peak shipping seasons; the introduction of new fleet types or decisions to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operations; and changes to planned service expansion activities. at may 31, 2023, we had 11 aircraft temporarily idled. these aircraft have been idled for an average of five months and are expected to return to revenue service in order to meet expected demand.
during the fourth quarter of 2023, we reviewed long-lived assets at fedex dataworks for impairment. based on our reviews, we recognized an $11 million ($8 million, net of tax, or $0.03 per diluted share) asset impairment charge related to an intangible asset from the shoprunner acquisition. for more information, see note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
leases. we utilize operating leases to finance certain of our aircraft, facilities, and equipment. such arrangements typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the assets at the end of the lease period to the lessor. in accordance with the new lease accounting standard adopted in 2020, we had $18 billion in operating lease liabilities and $17 billion in related right-of-use assets on the balance sheet as of may 31, 2023. the weighted-average remaining lease term of all operating leases outstanding at may 31, 2023 was 9.5 years.
our leases generally contain options to extend or terminate the lease. we reevaluate our leases on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options, and how they align with our operating strategy. therefore, substantially all the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability as the options to extend are not reasonably certain at lease commencement. short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized in the right-to-use asset and lease liability on the consolidated balance sheets.
the lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date and determined using the present value of the minimum lease payments not yet paid and our incremental borrowing rate, which approximates the rate at which we would borrow, on a collateralized basis, over the term of a lease in the applicable currency environment. the interest rate implicit in the lease is generally not determinable in transactions where we are the lessee.
the determination of whether a lease is accounted for as a finance lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimates primarily about the fair value of the asset and its estimated economic useful life. in addition, our evaluation includes ensuring we properly account for build-to-suit lease arrangements and making judgments about whether various forms of lessee involvement during the construction period allow the lessee to control the underlying leased asset during the construction period. we believe we have well-defined and controlled processes for making these evaluations, including obtaining third-party appraisals for material transactions to assist us in making these evaluations.
goodwill. we had $6.4 billion of recorded goodwill at may 31, 2023 and $6.5 billion of recorded goodwill at may 31, 2022 from our business acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. several factors give rise to goodwill in our acquisitions, such as the expected benefits from synergies of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired business.
goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. in our evaluation of goodwill impairment, we perform a qualitative assessment that requires management judgment and the use of estimates to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. an entity has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. an entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. we performed both qualitative and quantitative assessments of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022. this included comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value (including attributable goodwill). fair value is estimated using standard valuation methodologies (principally the income or market approach classified as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy) incorporating market participant considerations and management's assumptions on revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates, and expected capital expenditures. estimates used by management can significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test. changes in forecasted operating results and other assumptions could materially affect these estimates.
as part of our qualitative assessment, we consider changes in the macroeconomic environment such as the general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and other developments in equity and credit markets.

the market approach uses observable market data of comparable public companies to estimate fair value utilizing financial metrics such as operating value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. we apply judgment to select appropriate comparison companies based on the business operations, growth, size, and risk profile relative to our reporting units. changes to our selection of comparable companies may result in changes to the estimates of fair value of our reporting units.
in connection with our annual impairment testing of goodwill conducted in the fourth quarter of 2023, we recorded an impairment charge of $36 million ($36 million, net of tax, or $0.14 per diluted share) for all of the goodwill attributable to our fedex dataworks reporting unit. the key factors contributing to the goodwill impairment were underperformance of the shoprunner business during 2023, including base business erosion, and the failure to attain the level of operating synergies and revenue and profit growth anticipated at the time of acquisition. based on these factors, our outlook for the business changed in the fourth quarter of 2023.
our other reporting units with significant recorded goodwill include fedex express, fedex ground, and fedex freight. we evaluated these reporting units during the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022 and the estimated fair value of each of these reporting units exceeded their carrying values as of the end of 2023 and 2022; therefore, we do not believe that any of these reporting units were impaired as of the balance sheet dates.
legal and other contingencies we are subject to various loss contingencies in connection with our operations. contingent liabilities are difficult to measure, as their measurement is subject to multiple factors that are not easily predicted or projected. further, additional complexity in measuring these liabilities arises due to the various jurisdictions in which these matters occur, which makes our ability to predict their outcome highly uncertain. moreover, different accounting rules must be employed to account for these items based on the nature of the contingency. accordingly, significant management judgment is required to assess these matters and to make determinations about the measurement of a liability, if any. certain pending loss contingencies are described in note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. in the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, of individual matters or groups of related matters not specifically described in note 18 is not expected to be material to our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. the following describes our methods and associated processes for evaluating these matters.
because of the complex environment in which we operate, we are subject to numerous legal proceedings and claims, including those relating to general commercial matters, governmental enforcement actions, employment-related claims, vehicle accidents, and fedex ground's service providers. accounting guidance for contingencies requires an accrual of estimated loss from a contingency, such as a non-income tax or other legal proceeding or claim, when it is probable (i.e., the future event or events are likely to occur) that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. this guidance also requires disclosure of a loss contingency matter when, in management's judgment, a material loss is reasonably possible or probable.
during the preparation of our financial statements, we evaluate our contingencies to determine whether it is probable, reasonably possible, or remote that a liability has been incurred. a loss is recognized for all contingencies deemed probable and estimable, regardless of amount. for unresolved contingencies with potentially material exposure that are deemed reasonably possible, we evaluate whether a potential loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated.
our evaluation of these matters is the result of a comprehensive process designed to ensure that accounting recognition of a loss or disclosure of these contingencies is made in a timely manner and involves our legal and accounting personnel, as well as external counsel where applicable. the process includes regular communications during each quarter and scheduled meetings shortly before the completion of our financial statements to evaluate any new legal proceedings and the status of existing matters.
in determining whether a loss should be accrued or a loss contingency disclosed, we evaluate, among other factors:
•the current status of each matter within the scope and context of the entire lawsuit or proceeding (e.g., the lengthy and complex nature of class-action matters);
•the procedural status of each matter;
•any opportunities to dispose of a lawsuit on its merits before trial (i.e., motion to dismiss or for summary judgment);
•the amount of time remaining before a trial date;
•the status of discovery;
•the status of settlement, arbitration, or mediation proceedings; and
•our judgment regarding the likelihood of success prior to or at trial.

in reaching our conclusions with respect to accrual of a loss or loss contingency disclosure, we take a holistic view of each matter based on these factors and the information available prior to the issuance of our financial statements. uncertainty with respect to an individual factor or combination of these factors may impact our decisions related to accrual or disclosure of a loss contingency, including a conclusion that we are unable to establish an estimate of possible loss or a meaningful range of possible loss. we update our disclosures to reflect our most current understanding of the contingencies at the time we issue our financial statements. however, events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs materially from our previously estimated liability or range of possible loss.
despite the inherent complexity in the accounting and disclosure of contingencies, we believe that our processes are robust and thorough and provide a consistent framework for management in evaluating the potential outcome of contingencies for proper accounting recognition and disclosure.

for a more complete discussion of these risks, please see below.
business, strategic and operational risks our revenues and profits may decline if we are unable to maintain relationships with significant clients, distributors and other parties, or renew contracts with them on favorable terms, or if those parties face financial, reputational or regulatory issues.
the success of our business depends largely on our relationships and contractual arrangements with significant clients, distributors and other parties, including vendors. many of these arrangements are exclusive and some rely on preferred provider or similar relationships. if our key clients, distributors or other parties terminate important business arrangements with us, reduce their business with us or renew contracts on terms less favorable to us, which occurs from time to time, we may fail to meet our business objectives and targets, and our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
each of our global lifestyle and global housing segments receives a substantial portion of its revenue from a few clients. a reduction in business with or the loss of one or more of our significant clients could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and cash flows of individual segments or the company. reliance on a few significant clients may weaken our bargaining power, and we may be unable to renew contracts with them without concessions (including up-front payments) or on favorable terms or at all. examples of important business arrangements include, at global lifestyle, exclusive and non-exclusive relationships with mobile service providers (including carriers, retailers, oems and cable operators), dealerships and agents, consumer electronics retailers, appliance retailers (including e-commerce retailers), and financial, insurance and other institutions through which we distribute our products and services. at global housing, we have exclusive and non-exclusive relationships with mortgage lenders and servicers, manufactured housing lenders, property managers, and financial, insurance and other institutions.
we are subject to the risk that clients, distributors and other parties may face financial difficulties (including as a result of macroeconomic challenges), reputational issues, problems with respect to their own products and services, or regulatory restrictions or compliance issues that may lead to lower than expected or cessation of sales of our products and services and have other adverse impacts on our results of operations or financial condition. in addition, our clients and other parties with whom we do business may change their strategic priorities or initiatives, including exiting or deprioritizing products, services, programs, distribution channels or lines of business that we service or support, or they may disintermediate us by developing internal capabilities, products or services that would allow them to service their clients without our involvement, which has occurred from time to time and  may materially reduce our revenues and profits. furthermore, if one or more of our clients or distributors, for example in the wireless, automotive or mortgage servicing markets, consolidate or align themselves with other companies with whom we do not do business, they may choose to utilize or distribute the products and services of our competitors, which could materially reduce our revenues and profits.
significant competitive pressures, changes in customer preferences and disruption could adversely affect our results of operations.
we compete for business, clients, customers, agents and other distribution relationships with many insurance companies, warranty and protection companies, financial services companies, mobile device repair and logistics companies, technology and software companies and specialized competitors that focus on one market, product or service. some of our competitors may offer a broader array of products and services than we do or be better able to tailor those products and services to customer needs, including through better technology systems or infrastructure, or may have greater diversity of distribution resources, better brand recognition, more competitive pricing, lower costs, greater financial strength, more resources or higher ratings.
there is a risk that purchasers may be able to obtain more favorable terms and offerings from competitors, vendors or other third parties, including pricing and technology. additionally, customers may turn to our competitors as a result of our or our client's failure, or perceived failure, to deliver on customer expectations, product or service flaws, technology issues, gaps in operational support or other issues affecting customer experience. as a result, competition may adversely affect the persistency of our policies, our ability to sell products and provide services, maintain client relationships, and our revenues and results of operations, which has occurred from time to time.
to remain competitive in many of our businesses, we must anticipate and respond effectively to changes in customer preferences, new industry standards, evolving distribution models, disruptive technology developments and alternate business models. the evolving nature of consumer needs and preferences and improvements in technology could result in a reduction in consumer demand and in the prices of the products and services we offer. our competitive position may be impacted if we are unable to deploy, in a cost effective and competitive manner, technology such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, or if our competitors collect and use data which we do not have the ability to access or use. in addition, across many of our businesses, we must respond to the threat of disruption by traditional players, such as insurers, as well as from new entrants, such as "insurtech" start-up companies and others. these players are focused on using technology and innovation to simplify and improve the customer experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and effect other potentially disruptive changes in the markets in which we operate. in order to maintain a competitive position, we must continue to invest in new technologies and new ways to deliver our products and services. if we do not anticipate and respond effectively to changes in customer preferences, new industry standards, evolving distribution models, disruptive technology developments and alternative business models, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.
the success of our business depends on the execution of our strategy, including through the continuing service of key executives, senior leaders, highly-skilled personnel and a high-performing workforce.
our strategy is focused on delivering long-term profitable growth. as part of our strategy, we are developing new and innovative products and services, and enhancing existing offerings. we are investing in technology, including artificial intelligence, and other capabilities to continuously improve the customer and employee experience, while seeking to increase efficiencies. we will continue to incur expenses related to, among other things: investments in digital capabilities and large-scale, critical programs, such as technology, including global financial systems and infrastructure; research and development of new products and capabilities; scaling our global operations, including accessing the global talent hubs such as through our global capabilities centers; and costs associated with the implementation of new contracts and businesses in runoff or which we have exited or which we expect to fully exit, including sharing economy, , and improvements in operational efficiency. in 2022 and 2023, we announced restructuring initiatives that include realigning our organizational structure and talent to support our business strategy, which has resulted in severance and employee benefits charges, and accelerating ongoing real estate consolidation efforts to support work-from-home arrangements. actual costs to implement these initiatives may exceed our estimates and we may not be able to fully realize our expected run rate savings and operational efficiency improvements. our long-term strategy depends on successful operational execution and our ability to execute on our transformational initiatives, including acquisitions, combined with our ability to innovate and develop new products, achieve operating efficiencies, and attract and retain a global and diverse workforce. see " - we may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates at attractive prices, integrate acquired businesses or divest of non-strategic businesses effectively or achieve organic growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations."
we rely on the continued service of key executives, senior leaders, highly-skilled personnel and a high-performing workforce to achieve our long-term strategy. we believe that our future success depends in substantial part on our ability to attract, recruit, motivate, develop and retain a high-performing workforce, particularly those with specialized industry knowledge or within critical or in-demand areas such as sales, digital, customer experience, data and analytics, and supply chain, across our lines of businesses. doing so may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions; employee expectations; the effectiveness of our talent strategies and total rewards and wellbeing programs; and fluctuations in the labor market, including rising wages and competition for talent, which has generally increased due to persistent labor shortages and wage inflation. in addition, the global talent market and shift to remote or hybrid work arrangements at many companies, including us, have significantly increased competition for highly-skilled personnel, who are no longer limited to opportunities within a particular geographic area, and may decrease employee engagement. we rely on attracting, retaining and developing talent, including at the executive level, with diverse backgrounds and experiences to effectively manage our businesses and drive our long-term strategy. if we do not succeed in attracting, retaining and developing key talent, our revenue growth and profitability may be materially adversely affected. furthermore, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for and successfully carry out the succession of our key executives and senior leaders.
we may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates at attractive prices, integrate acquired businesses or divest of non-strategic businesses effectively or achieve organic growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or new venture opportunities, or to finance or complete transactions on acceptable terms or in a timely manner. additionally, the integration of acquired businesses and divestiture of non-strategic businesses or assets may result in significant challenges and additional costs, and we may be unable to accomplish such transactions efficiently or effectively.
acquisitions of businesses and divestitures of non-strategic businesses may not provide us with the benefits that we anticipate, require significant effort and expenditures, and entail numerous risks, difficulties and uncertainties. these include, among others, diversion of management's attention and resources to the integration of operations and infrastructure, which could otherwise have been devoted to other strategic opportunities; inaccurate assessment of risks and liabilities; difficulties in realizing projected revenues, earnings, cash flows, business opportunities, growth prospects, efficiencies, synergies and cost savings, including the incurrence of unexpected integration, compliance or divestiture costs; difficulties in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers; exposure to jurisdictions or businesses with heightened legal and regulatory risks, including corruption, which may increase compliance costs; difficulties in integrating operations and systems, including cybersecurity and other technology systems, and internal control over financial reporting; difficulties in assimilating employees and corporate cultures; an increase in our indebtedness or future borrowing costs; and limitations on our ability to access additional capital when needed. our failure to adequately address these and other transaction risks, difficulties and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
the market price of our stock may decline if we are unable to integrate acquired businesses or divest of non-strategic businesses successfully, if the integration or divestiture takes longer than expected or fails to achieve financial benefits to the extent anticipated by financial analysts or investors, or if the effect of the business combination on the financial results of the combined company or the divestiture on the financial results of the standalone company is otherwise not consistent with the expectations of financial analysts or investors.
our ability to effectively identify and capitalize on opportunities for organic growth depends on, among other things, our ability to: deliver on customer expectations and provide a positive customer experience; successfully execute large-scale, critical programs and projects in a timely and cost-effective manner; identify and successfully enter and market our services in new geographic markets and market segments; recruit and retain qualified personnel; coordinate our efforts across various geographic markets and market segments; maintain and grow relationships with our existing customers and expand our customer base; offer new products and services; form strategic alliances and partnerships; secure key vendor and distributor relationships; and access sufficient capital. there can be no assurance that we will be successful in executing on our organic growth initiatives or that those initiatives will provide us with the expected benefits. our failure to effectively identify and capitalize on opportunities for organic growth could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. see " - the success of our business depends on the execution of our strategy, including through the continuing service of key executives, senior leaders, highly-skilled personnel and a high-performing workforce."
our inability to successfully recover should we experience a business continuity event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
if we experience a business continuity event, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist incident, pandemic, security breach, cybersecurity incident, power loss, telecommunications outage or other systems failure, or other disaster, our ability to continue operations will depend on an effective business continuity and disaster recovery plan, including the safety and continued availability of our personnel, vendors and other third parties, and the proper functioning of our telecommunications and other systems and operations, including our device care centers and other facilities. an extended period of such conditions may strain our business continuity and disaster recovery plan, introduce additional operational risk, including cybersecurity and fraud risks, negatively impact employee morale, result in negative publicity, reputational harm and the loss of profitability and clients. our inability to successfully recover from a business continuity event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. see " - technology, cybersecurity and privacy risks - the failure to effectively maintain and modernize our technology systems and infrastructure and integrate those of acquired businesses could adversely affect our business."
our operations depend upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage and interruption. if a business continuity event occurs, we could lose company, customer, vendor and other third-party data, lose significant processing capability, or experience interruptions to our operations, the availability of our systems or delivery of products and services to our clients and their customers, which has occurred from time to time and which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we rely on certain third-party technology systems that have in the past experienced a business continuity event, which impacted our operations. a cybersecurity incident or other business continuity event affecting us or key third parties with whom we work could result in a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our technology systems or operations, requiring us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues, and divert management's attention. see " - technology, cybersecurity and privacy risks - we could incur significant liability if our technology systems or those of third parties are breached or we or third parties otherwise fail to protect the security of data residing on our respective systems, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations."
the risk of business disruption is more pronounced in certain geographic areas across the world, including the cities in which our device care centers, data centers and operations personnel are located; major metropolitan centers, such as atlanta, where our headquarters is located; and certain catastrophe-prone areas, such as miami, florida, where we have significant operations. this risk is heightened in certain countries and regions in which we operate that are subject to higher potential threat of terrorist incidents, military conflicts, political instability and data breaches.
a disaster or other business continuity event on a significant scale or affecting our key businesses or our data centers, or our inability to successfully and quickly recover from such an event and any legislative and regulatory responses thereto, could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, loss of clients and their customers or damaged relationships, legal liability and other adverse consequences. our liability insurance policies may not fully cover, in type or amount, the cost of a successful recovery in the event of such a disruption.
failure to successfully manage vendors and other third parties could adversely affect our business.
as we continue to improve operating efficiencies, we rely on vendors and other third parties, including independent contractors, to conduct business and provide services to our clients. we use vendors and other third parties for business, investment management, technology, operations, facilities management and other services. we take steps to monitor and regulate the performance of vendors and other third parties, including in our agreements with such parties, but our oversight controls could prove inadequate. since we do not fully control the actions of vendors and other third parties, we are subject to the risk that their decisions or operations adversely impact us and replacing them could create significant delay and expense. if these vendors or other third parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us or if they fail to comply with legal or regulatory requirements in a high-quality and timely manner, our operations and reputation could be compromised, we may not realize the anticipated economic and other benefits from these arrangements, and we could suffer adverse legal, regulatory and financial consequences. in addition, these third parties face their own technology, operating, business and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client, employee or company information or failure to comply with applicable law, could cause harm to our reputation or otherwise expose us to liability. an interruption in or the cessation of service by any service provider as a result of systems failures, capacity constraints, financial difficulties or for any other reason has occurred from time to time and could materially disrupt our operations, impact our ability to offer certain products and services and result in contractual or regulatory penalties, liability claims from clients or employees, damage to our reputation and harm to our business. if we are unable to attract and retain relationships with qualified vendors, independent contractors and other third-party service providers, or if changes in law or judicial decisions require independent contractors to be classified as employees, our business could be significantly adversely affected.
to the extent we engage international vendors or third parties to provide services or carry out business functions, we are exposed to the risks that accompany operations in a foreign jurisdiction, including international economic and political conditions, foreign laws and regulations, fluctuations in currency values and increased risk of data breaches. for more information on the risks associated with the use of international vendors and third parties, see " - we face risks associated with our international operations."
we face risks associated with our international operations.
our international operations face economic, political, legal, compliance, regulatory, operational, supply chain and other risks. for example, we face the risk of restrictions on currency conversion and the repatriation of non-u.s. investments and earnings; burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and the associated risk and costs of non-compliance, including reputational harm; exposure to undeveloped or evolving legal systems, which may result in unpredictable or inconsistent application of laws and regulations, including export controls and exposure to commercial, political, legal or regulatory risks such as corruption; political, economic or other instability in countries in which we conduct business, including possible terrorist acts; the imposition of sanctions, tariffs, trade barriers or other protectionist laws or business practices that favor local competition, increase costs and may otherwise adversely affect our business; inflation and foreign exchange rate fluctuations; diminished ability to enforce our contractual rights; increased risk of data breaches; differences in cultural environments; changes in regulatory requirements, including changes in regulatory treatment of certain products or services; exposure to local economic conditions and its impact on our clients' performance and creditworthiness; and a competitive global labor market.
if our business model is not successful in a particular country or region, or a country or region in which we do business experiences economic, political or other instability, we may lose all or part of our investment in that country or region. as we continue to scale our global operations and grow our international labor force within global capabilities centers, our business becomes increasingly exposed to these and other risks, including where certain countries or regions have recently experienced economic or political instability, such as in argentina and brazil.
as we engage with international clients, we may make certain up-front commission payments or similar cash outlays, which we may not recover if the business does not develop as we expect. these up-front payments are typically supported by various protections, such as letters of credit, letters of guarantee and real estate, but we may not fully or timely recover amounts owed to us as a result of difficulties in enforcing contracts or judgments in undeveloped or evolving legal systems and other factors. in addition, we rely on fronting carriers in certain countries to maintain their licenses and product approvals, satisfy local regulatory requirements and continue in business. if they fail to do so, our business, reputation, and relationships with our clients and their customers could be adversely affected.
for additional information on the significant international regulations that apply to us and the risks relating thereto, see "item 1 - business - regulation - international regulation" in this report, " - business, strategic and operational risks - our mobile business is subject to the risk of declines in the value and availability of mobile devices, and to regulatory compliance and other risks," " - legal and regulatory risks - we are subject to extensive laws and regulations, which increase our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business, and violations or alleged violations of such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations," " - legal and regulatory risks - our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions" and " - legal and regulatory risks - the costs of complying with, or our failure to comply with, u.s. and foreign laws related to privacy, data security and data protection could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and reputation.."
our mobile business is subject to the risk of declines in the value and availability of mobile devices, and to regulatory compliance and other risks.
the value of the mobile devices that we collect and refurbish for our clients may fall below the prices we have paid or guaranteed, which could adversely affect our profitability. our mobile business is subject to the risk that the value, including selling price, or availability of devices and parts will be adversely affected by: technological changes affecting the usefulness or desirability of the devices and parts; physical problems resulting from faulty design or manufacturing; increased competition; decreased customer demand, including due to changes in customer preferences, changes in client promotions and seasonality; supply chain constraints; and growing industry emphasis on cost containment. the value and availability of devices may also be impacted by adverse foreign trade relationships and an escalation of u.s.-china and china-taiwan trade tensions, including with respect to trade policies, treaties, government relations, tariffs and other trade restrictions. if the value or availability of devices or parts is significantly reduced, it could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.
our sales of mobile devices to third parties subject us to regulatory compliance risk, which may subject us to fines or other sanctions, and increase the costs of operating the business, including compliance expenses. while we conduct diligence and screening for buyers of mobile devices that we sell, and change buyers in our program based on diligence reviews, our mobile device buyers may not comply with applicable laws and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. in addition, our sales of mobile devices to third parties domiciled outside of the u.s. subject us to compliance risks relating to corruption, sanctions and export control laws and regulations, which may adversely impact our ability to find buyers. furthermore, certain businesses we acquire may violate, and from time to time have violated, such laws and regulations, which could subject us to liability. non-compliance with such laws could adversely affect our business, reputation, relationships with our clients and their customers, financial condition and results of operations. see " - we face risks associated with our international operations" and " - significant competitive pressures, changes in customer preferences and disruption could adversely affect our results of operations."
sales of our products and services may decline if we are unable to develop and maintain distribution sources or attract and retain sales representatives and executives with key client relationships.
we distribute many of our insurance products and services through a variety of channels, including service providers (including device carriers and cable operators), financial institutions, mortgage lenders and servicers, retailers, association groups, other third-party marketing organizations and, to a limited extent, our own captives and affiliated agents. our relationships with these distributors are significant for our revenues and profits. there is intense competition for distribution outlets. agents who distribute our products are typically not exclusively dedicated to us, but also market the products of our competitors. in some cases, such agents may be affiliated with other insurers who may choose to write the product that such agents are now selling on our behalf.
we have our own sales representatives. we depend in large part on our sales representatives and business executives to develop and maintain client relationships. our inability to attract and retain effective sales representatives and executives with key client relationships could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
we face risks associated with joint ventures, franchises and investments in which we share ownership or management with third parties.
from time to time, we have entered into and may continue to enter into joint ventures and franchises and invest in entities in which we share ownership or management with third parties. in certain circumstances, we may not have complete control over governance, financial reporting, operations, legal and regulatory compliance, or other matters relating to such joint ventures, franchises or entities. as a result, we may face certain operational, financial, legal and regulatory compliance and other risks relating to these joint ventures, franchises and entities, including risks related to the financial strength of joint venture partners, franchisees and other investors; the willingness of joint venture partners, franchisees and other investors to provide adequate funding for the joint venture, franchise or entity; differing goals, strategies, priorities or objectives between us and joint venture partners, franchisees or other investors; our inability to unilaterally implement actions, policies or procedures with respect to the joint venture, franchise or entity that we believe are favorable; legal and regulatory compliance risks relating to actions of the joint venture, franchise, entity, joint venture partners, franchisees or other investors; the risk that the actions of joint venture partners, franchisees and other investors could damage our brand image and reputation; and the risk that we will be unable to resolve disputes with joint venture partners, franchisees or other investors. as a result, joint ventures, franchises and investments in which we share ownership or management subject us to risk and may contribute significantly less than anticipated to our earnings and cash flows.
catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses, including as a result of climate change and the current inflationary environment, could materially reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
our insurance operations expose us to claims arising from catastrophes and other events, particularly in our homeowners insurance, renters insurance and flood offerings, as well as in certain businesses the company has fully exited or expects to fully exit, including sharing economy. catastrophes include hurricanes, windstorms, tornados, earthquakes, hailstorms, floods, severe winter weather, wildfires, terrorist incidents and accidents, and may result in reportable catastrophe losses, which are individual catastrophe events that generate losses in excess of $5.0 million, pre-tax, net of reinsurance and client profit sharing adjustments, and including reinstatement and other premiums. non-catastrophe losses include losses from isolated fire, water and wind damage, theft and vandalism, as well as general liability in renters and homeowners policies, and losses from sharing economy. losses are impacted by increases in inflation and supply chain disruptions that increase the cost of materials and labor required to settle claims, including in our global housing business. in addition, non-catastrophe losses related to the sharing economy business in particular have been, and may continue to be, impacted by increased claim settlement and loss adjustment expenses. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses that materially reduce our profitability and impact our available capital, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
changing weather patterns and climate change have increased the unpredictability, frequency and severity of weather-related events, such as wildfires, hurricanes, floods and tornadoes, particularly in coastal areas such as florida, california and texas, and may result in increased claims and higher catastrophe losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. regulation in the area of climate change is increasing and we cannot predict how legal, regulatory, political and social responses to concerns around climate change may impact our business. while the frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable, increases in the value and geographic concentration of insured property and the effects of inflation have and may continue to increase the frequency and severity of claims from catastrophes. in addition, legislative and regulatory initiatives and court decisions may have the effect of limiting the ability of insurers to manage catastrophe losses, including by forcing expansion of certain insurance coverages for catastrophe claims, which may adversely impact our business. see " - macroeconomic, political and global market risks - general economic, financial market and political conditions and conditions in the markets in which we operate may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition."
catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses can vary widely and could significantly exceed our expectations. we use modeling tools that help estimate our probable losses, but these projections are based on historical data and other assumptions that may differ materially from actual events, and their reliability and predictive value may decrease as a result of climate change. these modeling tools may not be able to anticipate emerging trends or changing marketplace conditions. see " - financial risks - actual results may differ materially from the analytical models we use to assist in our decision-making in key areas such as pricing, catastrophe risks, reserving and capital management."
we purchase reinsurance for certain risks, but if the severity of an event were sufficiently high, our losses could exceed our reinsurance coverage limits and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, the availability and cost of reinsurance can be adversely impacted by market conditions. see " - financial risks - reinsurance may not be adequate or available to protect us against losses, and we are subject to the credit risk of reinsurers." in addition, claims from catastrophe and non-catastrophe events could result in substantial volatility in our results of operations and financial condition for any particular fiscal quarter or year.
accounting rules do not permit insurers to reserve for catastrophe or non-catastrophe events before they occur. once such an event occurs, the establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain and complex process. the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves and such variance may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and capital. see " - financial risks - our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims, requiring us to establish additional reserves or to incur additional expense for settling unreserved liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, profitability and capital."
because global housing's lender-placed homeowners and lender-placed manufactured housing insurance products are designed to automatically provide property coverage for client portfolios, our exposure to certain catastrophe-prone locations, such as florida, california and texas, may increase. the withdrawal of other insurers from these or other states may lead to adverse selection and increased use of our products in these areas, and may negatively affect our loss experience and increase our costs.
negative publicity relating to our business, industry or clients may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
we communicate with and distribute our products and services ultimately to individual customers. from time to time, regulators, consumer advocacy groups, the media and individual customers may focus their attention on our products and services, which may subject us to negative publicity. we may be negatively affected if another company in one of our industries or in a related industry, or if one of our clients, engages in practices that subject our industry or businesses to negative publicity. negative publicity may result from judicial inquiries, unfavorable outcomes in lawsuits, social media, regulatory or governmental actions with respect to our products or services and industry commercial practices. for example, regulators may submit queries to assess practices in the insurance sector that potentially disadvantage people of color or historically underrepresented groups in certain insurance lines of business, or whether customers have received fair value from our products and services. in addition, there is increased investor and regulatory focus on sustainability matters, including diversity, equity and inclusion, and commitment to long-term sustainability and efforts related to climate. a failure or perceived failure in our achievement of various sustainability initiatives and goals we announce from time to time, or an actual or perceived increase in related risks as a result of our or our industry's business activities, may subject us to negative publicity.
negative publicity may cause increased regulation and legislative scrutiny of industry practices as well as increased litigation or enforcement action by civil and criminal authorities. additionally, negative publicity may increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by impeding our ability to market our products and services, constraining our ability to price our products appropriately for the risks we are assuming, requiring us to change the products and services we offer or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate.
macroeconomic, political and global market risks general economic, financial market and political conditions and conditions in the markets in which we operate may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
limited availability of credit, deteriorations of the global mortgage and real estate markets, declines in consumer confidence and consumer spending, including in europe, increases in prices or in the rate of inflation, periods of high unemployment or labor shortages, persistently low or rapidly increasing interest rates, disruptive geopolitical events, including the israel-hamas war, china-taiwan relations and supply chain disruptions, and other events outside of our control, such as a major epidemic or a pandemic, political or civil unrest, or the possibility of a u.s. government shutdown or default on its debt obligations, could contribute, and in some cases have contributed, to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the financial markets, including the market for our stock, and may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. specifically, during periods of economic downturn:
•individuals and businesses may (i) choose not to purchase our insurance products, extended service contracts and other products and services, (ii) terminate existing policies or contracts or permit them to lapse and (iii) choose to reduce the amount of coverage they purchase;
•conditions in the markets in which we operate may deteriorate, impacting, among other things, consumer demand for the mobile devices, electronics, appliances, automobiles, housing and other products we insure, including the rate of introduction and success of new products, technologies and promotional programs that provide opportunities for growth;
•clients are more likely to underperform expectations, experience financial distress and declare bankruptcy, which could have an adverse impact on the remittance of premiums from such clients and the collection of receivables from such clients for items such as unearned premiums and could otherwise expose us to credit risk;
•claims on certain specialized insurance products tend to rise;
•there is a risk of fraudulent insurance claims;
•there may be an impairment in the value of our tangible and intangible assets and our investment portfolio may be adversely affected;
•there may be fluctuations in the labor market and a negative impact on employee retention; and
•our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms or at all may be negatively impacted.
general inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, including within the current environment, has and may continue to increase the costs of paying claims, including for materials and labor, particularly in our global housing and global automotive businesses. in addition, inflationary pressures and shortages in the labor market have increased, and may continue to increase, our labor costs, including employee wages, and changes in interest rates  has impacted, and may continue to impact, our investment portfolio and capital. see " - financial risks - our investment portfolio is subject to market risk, including changes in interest rates, that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition." conversely, deflationary pressures may affect the pricing of our products and services.
financial risks our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims, requiring us to establish additional reserves or to incur additional expense for settling unreserved liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, profitability and capital.
we maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate exposure for claims and claim adjustment expenses with respect to reported claims and incurred but not reported ("ibnr") claims as of the end of each accounting period. whether calculated under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"), statutory accounting principles or accounting principles applicable in foreign jurisdictions, reserves are estimates. reserving is inherently a matter of judgment and our ultimate liabilities could exceed reserves for a variety of reasons, including changes in macroeconomic factors (such as inflation, unemployment and interest rates), case development and other factors. from time to time, we adjust our reserves, and may adjust our reserving methodology, as these factors, our claims experience and estimates of future trends in claims frequency and severity change. reserve adjustments may cause volatility in our reported results, such as the reserve reductions in 2023 compared to reserve increases in 2022. reserve development, changes in our reserving methodology and paid losses exceeding corresponding reserves could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, profitability and capital. see "item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - critical accounting estimates - reserves" in this report for additional detail on our reserves.
we may be unable to accurately predict and price for claims and other costs, which could reduce our profitability.
our profitability could be reduced if we are unable to accurately predict and price for claims and other costs, including the frequency and severity of property and other claims. this ability could be affected by various factors, including macroeconomic conditions; inflation; changes in the regulatory environment; changes in industry practices; changes in legal, social or environmental conditions; impacts from operational changes; new technologies or domestic or global supply chain or labor issues. in addition, our modeling tools that support business decisions involve historical data and numerous assumptions that may differ materially from actual events. climate change may make it more difficult to predict and model catastrophes, reducing our ability to accurately price our exposure to such events and mitigate risks. the inability to accurately predict and price for claims and other costs, including costs related to climate change and macroeconomic conditions, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. see " - financial risks - actual results may differ materially from the analytical models we use to assist in our decision-making in key areas such as pricing, catastrophe risks, reserving and capital management."
a decline in the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
ratings are important considerations in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. a.m. best rates most of our domestic and certain international operating insurance subsidiaries. moody's and s&p rate three of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries.  these ratings are subject to periodic review by a.m. best, moody's and s&p, and we cannot assure that we will be able to retain them. rating agencies may change their methodology or requirements for determining ratings, or they may become more conservative in assigning ratings. rating agencies could increase capital requirements for our subsidiaries or the enterprise, thereby reducing deployable capital at such subsidiary or at the holding company. any reduction in these ratings could materially adversely affect our standing in the insurance industry and the demand for our products from intermediaries and consumers, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
as of december 31, 2023, our operations had a significant number of contracts that contain provisions that require the applicable subsidiaries to maintain minimum financial strength ratings, typically from a.m. best, ranging from "a" or better to "b+" or better, depending on the contract. our clients may terminate these contracts or fail to renew them if the subsidiaries' ratings fall below these minimums. termination of or failure to renew these agreements could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
a credit rating agency downgrade of our corporate senior debt rating could materially and adversely impact our business.
currently, assurant, inc.'s senior debt is rated bbb by s&p and baa2 by moody's, and both ratings carry a stable outlook.
if our senior debt credit ratings were downgraded, particularly if downgraded below investment grade, our business, financial condition and results of operations, and perceptions of our financial strength, could be materially and adversely affected. a downgrade could adversely affect our liquidity and ability to access liquidity quickly or at all, increase our borrowing costs, decrease demand for our debt securities, and increase the expense and difficulty of financing our operations, including temporary financing for subsidiaries necessary to address any immediate liquidity concerns, or refinancing our existing indebtedness on similar or more favorable terms. for example, the interest rate payable on certain series of our senior notes is subject to increase if either of s&p or moody's downgrades the credit rating assigned to such series of senior notes to bb+ or below or to ba1 or below, respectively. additionally, we could be subject to more restrictive financial and operational covenants in any indebtedness we issue in the future, which could reduce our operational flexibility. there can be no assurance that our credit ratings will not be downgraded. see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information on our senior notes and the impact of rating changes.
fluctuations in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar and other foreign currencies may materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
while most of our costs and revenues are in u.s. dollars, some are in other currencies, including labor costs in our international locations and global capabilities centers. because our financial results in certain countries are translated from local currency into u.s. dollars upon consolidation, our results of operations, including period-over-period comparisons, have been and may continue to be affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. to a large extent, we do not currently hedge foreign currency risk. if the u.s. dollar weakens against a local currency, the translation of our foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, net revenue, operating expenses and net income. similarly, our net assets, net revenue, operating expenses and net income will decrease if the u.s. dollar strengthens against a local currency. in 2023, we reported a $31.3 million unfavorable impact to net income due to foreign exchange-related losses. these fluctuations in currency exchange rates may result in losses that materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
additionally, we may incur foreign exchange losses in connection with the designation of the u.s. dollar as the functional currency of our international subsidiaries. for example, argentina's economy is classified as highly inflationary in accordance with gaap accounting requirements and, as a result, the functional currency of our argentina subsidiaries was changed from the local currency to u.s. dollars and their non-u.s. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities were subject to remeasurement resulting in losses. we could incur additional losses, which would adversely affect our results of operations. for additional information on the change in functional currency for our argentina subsidiaries and the effect thereof, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
an impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets could materially adversely affect our results of operations and book value.
as a result of acquisitions, we have added a considerable amount of goodwill and other intangible assets to our balance sheet. goodwill represented 54% of our total equity as of december 31, 2023. we review our goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. such circumstances include a significant adverse change in legal factors, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, loss of key personnel or a significant decline in our expected future cash flows due to changes in company-specific factors or the broader business climate. in addition, other intangible assets collectively represented 12% of our total equity as of december 31, 2023. estimated useful lives of finite intangible assets are reassessed on an annual basis. generally, other intangible assets with finite lives are only tested for impairment if there are indicators of impairment identified, including a significant adverse change in the extent, manner or length of time in which the other intangible asset is being used or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the other intangible asset.
an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, or significant reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and book value. for more information on our annual goodwill impairment testing, the goodwill of our segments and related reporting units and intangible asset impairment testing, see "item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - critical accounting estimates - valuation and recoverability of goodwill" and notes 2 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.
as a public company, we are required to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. while management has certified that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31, 2023, because internal control over financial reporting is complex, there can be no assurance that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in the future. we rely on manual processes and procedures that subject us to increased risk of error and internal control failure compared to automated processes. in 2022, we identified and disclosed certain accounting errors. although we are in the process of implementing an integrated global financial system to, among other things, minimize our reliance on and use of manual processes, there can be no assurance that the implementation will be completed in a timely manner or on budget, or that it will achieve all of its intended goals. any failure to implement required controls, or difficulties or errors encountered in their operation, including as a result of remote work arrangements, could adversely affect our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. if we are not able to maintain or document effective internal control over financial reporting, our independent registered public accounting firm would be unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or opine that our financial statements fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with gaap. significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting may prevent us from reporting our financial information on a timely basis or cause us to restate previously issued financial information, and thereby subject us to litigation and adverse regulatory consequences, including fines and other sanctions, and would require us to claw back certain executive compensation, which would be costly and time-consuming. if any of the foregoing were to occur, investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements could erode, resulting in a decline in our stock price, impairing our ability to raise capital, negatively affecting our reputation and subjecting us to legal and regulatory risk.
unfavorable conditions in the capital and credit markets may significantly and adversely affect our access to capital and our ability to pay our debts or expenses.
the global capital and credit markets have experienced periods of uncertainty, volatility and disruption, including the possibility of a u.s. government shutdown or default on its debt obligations, changes to u.s. and foreign tax and trade policies, imposition of new or increased tariffs, other trade restrictions, other government actions, foreign currency fluctuations and other factors. our ability to raise money during such periods could be severely or entirely restricted. our ability to borrow or raise money is important if our operating cash flow is insufficient to pay our expenses, meet capital requirements, repay debt, pay dividends on our common stock or make investments. as a holding company, we have limited direct operations of our own. the principal sources of our liquidity are dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries, cash flow from our investment portfolio, the credit facility (as defined below) and liquid assets, consisting mainly of cash or assets that are readily convertible into cash. sources of liquidity in normal markets include a variety of short-and long-term instruments. if our access to the capital and credit markets is restricted, our cost of capital could increase, thus decreasing our profitability and reducing our financial flexibility, including our ability to refinance maturities of existing indebtedness on similar or more favorable terms. our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and statutory capital position could be materially and adversely affected by periods of uncertainty, volatility and disruption in the capital or credit markets.
our investment portfolio is subject to market risk, including changes in interest rates, that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
investment returns are an important part of our profitability. our investments are subject to market-wide risks and fluctuations, including in the fixed maturity, equity securities and real estate markets, which could impair our profitability, financial condition and cash flows. further, in pricing our products and services, we incorporate assumptions regarding returns on our investments. market conditions may not allow us to invest in assets with sufficiently high returns to meet our pricing assumptions and profit targets over the long term.
we are subject to interest rate risk in our investment portfolio. changes in interest rates have, and may continue to, materially adversely affect the performance of some of our investments, including by materially reducing the fair value of and investment income from fixed maturity securities and increasing unrealized losses in our investment portfolio, which can adversely impact our capital. as of december 31, 2023, fixed maturity securities represented approximately 84% of our total investments and full year 2023 gross investment income from fixed maturity securities totaled $335.3 million. the fair market value of fixed maturity securities generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us from future investments in fixed maturity securities generally increases or decreases directly with fluctuations in interest rates. in addition, actual investment income and cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations.
recent periods have been characterized by an overall increase in interest rates. a prolonged period during which interest rates remain at high levels may result in greater unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. conversely, a prolonged period during which interest rates are at lower levels may result in lower-than-expected investment income. we attempt to mitigate certain interest rate risk with hedging activities but such activities may not be effective. though we employ asset/liability management strategies to manage the adverse effects of interest rate changes, significant fluctuations may require us to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a significant loss to pay claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. see "item 7a - quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk -interest rate risk" in this report.
our investment portfolio is subject to credit, liquidity and other risks that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
we are subject to credit risk in our investment portfolio, primarily from our investments in corporate bonds, preferred stocks, leveraged loans, municipal bonds and commercial mortgages. defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations could reduce our investment income and result in realized investment losses. the value of our investments may be materially adversely affected by downgrades in the corporate bonds included in our portfolio, increases in treasury rates or credit spreads and by other factors that may result in realized and unrealized investment losses and other-than-temporary impairments. the determination that a security has incurred an other-than-temporary impairment requires the judgment of management and there are inherent risks and uncertainties involved in making these judgments. changes in facts, circumstances or critical assumptions could cause management to conclude that further impairments have occurred, which could lead to additional losses on investments. each of these events may cause us to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio. for further details on net investment losses, see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
the value of any particular fixed maturity security is subject to impairment based on the creditworthiness of its issuer. as of  december 31, 2023, fixed maturity securities represented approximately 84% and below investment grade securities (rated "bb" or lower by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations) represented approximately 5% of our total investments. below investment grade securities generally are expected to provide higher returns but present greater risk and can be less liquid than investment grade securities. a significant increase in defaults and impairments on our fixed maturity securities portfolio could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. see "item 7a - quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - credit risk" in this report for additional information on the composition of our fixed maturity securities portfolio.
equity securities represented approximately 3% of our total investments as of december 31, 2023. however, we have had higher percentages of equity securities in the past and may make more equity investments in the future. investments in equity securities generally are expected to provide higher total returns but present greater risk to preservation of capital than our fixed maturity securities. all changes in the fair value of equity securities are reported in our statements of operations, which has increased the volatility of our financial results. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information.
our investments in commercial mortgage loans on real estate (which represented approximately 4% of our total investments as of december 31, 2023) are relatively illiquid. if we require extremely large amounts of cash on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments at attractive prices and in a timely manner. in addition, default rates and losses on commercial mortgage loans are affected by a number of factors, including many u.s. regional lenders that are reducing their exposure to such loans.
the manner in which we allocate our resources across the portfolio or the types of assets in which we seek to invest may increase credit, liquidity and other risks that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
the value of our deferred tax assets could become impaired, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
in accordance with applicable income tax guidance, we must determine whether our ability to realize the value of our deferred tax asset or to recognize certain tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions is "more likely than not". under current income tax guidance, a deferred tax asset should be reduced by a valuation allowance, or a liability related to uncertain tax positions should be accrued, if, based on the weight of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. the realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character during the carryback or carry-forward periods.
in determining the appropriate valuation allowance, management made certain judgments relating to recoverability of deferred tax assets, use of tax loss and tax credit carry-forwards, levels of expected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. the assumptions in making these judgments are updated periodically on the basis of current business conditions affecting us and overall economic conditions. these management judgments are therefore subject to change due to factors that include changes in our ability to realize sufficient taxable income of the same character in the same jurisdiction or in our ability to execute other tax planning strategies. furthermore, any future changes in tax laws could impact the value of our deferred tax assets. management will continue to assess and determine the need for, and the amount of, the valuation allowance in subsequent periods. any change in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
reinsurance may not be adequate or available to protect us against losses, and we are subject to the credit risk of reinsurers.
as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various operating segments. we also access the florida hurricane catastrophe fund ("fhcf") and the reinsurance to assist policyholders ("rap") program to reinsure eligible florida risks, with the fhcf providing coverage each year and the rap program providing coverage for the 2023 wind season. although reinsurers are liable to us for claims properly ceded under our reinsurance arrangements, we remain liable to the insured as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. ceded reinsurance arrangements therefore do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims. we are subject to credit and other risks with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers, the fhcf and the rap program. the inability to collect amounts due from reinsurers and any changes in the fhcf and the rap program could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
the availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing reinsurance market conditions, which have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely impacted by: the occurrence of significant reinsured events, including catastrophes, or expectations regarding increased occurrences of such events due to climate change; and other impacts on reinsurers' capital, such as increased demand for coverage driven by inflation, a volatile investment market or unforeseen litigation costs. premiums charged for reinsurance coverage increased significantly in 2023 but have moderated slightly in 2024. in the future, we may not be able to obtain reinsurance coverage for some of our businesses at commercially reasonable rates or at all. in such a situation, we might be adversely affected by state and other regulations that prohibit us from excluding catastrophe exposures or from withdrawing from or increasing premium rates in catastrophe-prone areas. in addition, we may not be able to renew our current reinsurance facilities or obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts, at favorable rates and with favorable terms. the inability to obtain reinsurance at favorable rates or at all could cause us to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments, take more risk, hold more capital or incur higher costs. any of these developments could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
through reinsurance, we have sold or exited businesses that could again become our direct financial and administrative responsibility if the reinsurers become insolvent.
in the past, we have sold, and in the future we may sell, businesses through reinsurance ceded to third parties. we have exited, expect to fully exit and in the future may exit certain businesses, including small commercial, through reinsurance. we have a reinsurance recoverable balance with john hancock life insurance company ("john hancock") of $416.0 million as of december 31, 2023, related to the sale of our long-term care division through reinsurance. the a.m. best rating of john hancock is currently a+. certain assets backing reserves reinsured under this sale and other sales are held in trusts or separate accounts. however, if the reinsurers became insolvent, the assets in the trusts or separate accounts could prove insufficient to support the liabilities that would revert to us and we may again become responsible for administering these businesses. we do not currently have the administrative systems and capabilities to process these businesses. we might be forced to obtain such capabilities on unfavorable terms with a resulting material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, other third parties to whom we have sold businesses in the past may in turn sell these businesses to other third parties, through reinsurance or otherwise, and we could face credit risks and risks related to the new administrative systems and capabilities of these third parties in administering these businesses.
for more information on these arrangements, including the reinsurance recoverables and risk mitigation mechanisms used, see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
we are exposed to risks related to the creditworthiness and reporting systems of some of our agents, third-party administrators and clients.
we are subject to the credit risk of some of the agents, third-party administrators, clients and client-owned reinsurance companies with which we contract in our businesses. we may incur losses related to accounts receivables, write-downs of upfront fees, write-downs of deferred acquisition costs, insurance reserves held by third parties with or without collateral (including the impairment of any collateral), reimbursement of claims or commissions prepaid by us and loans granted to such counterparties. in addition, some of our agents, third-party administrators and clients collect and report premiums or pay claims on our behalf. also, under certain contractual arrangements, we pay claims on behalf of third parties and subsequently seek reimbursement. these parties' failure to remit all premiums collected or to pay claims on our behalf or to reimburse us for paid claims on a timely and accurate basis could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
our subsidiaries' inability to pay us sufficient dividends could prevent us from meeting our obligations and paying future stockholder dividends.
as a holding company whose principal assets are the capital stock of our subsidiaries, we rely primarily on dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding debt obligations, to repurchase shares or debt, to pay for certain expenses, to acquire new businesses, and to pay dividends to common stockholders. our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends and to make such other payments depends on their gaap equity or statutory surplus, future earnings, cash position, rating agency requirements and regulatory restrictions, as applicable. regulators could increase capital requirements for our subsidiaries, thereby reducing deployable capital at such subsidiary. except to the extent that we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, claims of our subsidiaries' creditors, including policyholders, have priority over our claims with respect to our subsidiaries' assets and earnings. if any of our subsidiaries becomes insolvent, liquidates or otherwise reorganizes, our creditors and stockholders will have no right to proceed against our subsidiary's assets or to cause the liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up of our subsidiary under applicable liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up laws. the applicable insurance laws of the jurisdiction where each of our insurance subsidiaries is domiciled would govern any proceedings relating to that subsidiary and the insurance authority of that jurisdiction would act as a liquidator or rehabilitator for the subsidiary.
the payment of dividends by any of our regulated domestic insurance company subsidiaries in excess of specified amounts (i.e., extraordinary dividends) must be approved by the subsidiary's domiciliary jurisdiction department of insurance. ordinary dividends, for which no regulatory approval is generally required, are limited to amounts determined by a formula, which varies by jurisdiction. some jurisdictions have an additional stipulation that dividends may only be paid out of earned surplus. if insurance regulators determine that payment of an ordinary dividend or any other payments by our insurance subsidiaries to us (such as payments under a tax sharing agreement or payments for employee or other services) would be adverse to policyholders or creditors, they may block such payments that would otherwise be permitted without prior approval. future regulatory actions could further restrict our insurance subsidiaries' ability to pay us dividends. for more information on the maximum amount of dividends our regulated u.s. domiciled insurance subsidiaries could pay us in 2023 under applicable laws and regulations, without prior regulatory approval, see "item 5 - market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities - dividend policy."
any additional material restrictions on our insurance subsidiaries' ability to pay us dividends could adversely affect our ability to pay any dividends on our common stock, service our debt and pay other expenses.
our ability to declare and pay dividends on our capital stock may be limited.
our declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock in the future will be determined by the board in its sole discretion and will depend on various factors, including: our subsidiaries' payment of dividends and other statutorily permissible payments to us; our results of operations and cash flows; our financial condition and capital requirements; general business conditions and growth prospects; any legal, tax, regulatory and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends; and any other factor the board deems relevant. the payment of dividends on our common stock may be subject to the preferential rights of preferred stock that the board may create from time to time. the credit facility contains limitations on our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders if we are in default, or such dividend payments would cause us to be in default, of our obligations thereunder. in addition, if we defer the payment of interest on our subordinated notes (as defined hereafter), we generally may not make payments on our capital stock. furthermore, the agreements governing any of our or our subsidiaries' future indebtedness may limit our ability to declare and pay dividends on our common stock. in the event that any agreements governing any such indebtedness restrict our ability to declare and pay dividends in cash on our common stock, we may be unable to declare and pay dividends in cash on our common stock unless we can repay or refinance the amounts outstanding under such agreements.
actual results may differ materially from the analytical models we use to assist in our decision-making in key areas such as pricing, catastrophe risks, reserving and capital management.
we use various modeling techniques and data analytics throughout the organization to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends, and other risks associated with our assets, liabilities, profitability and cash flows. this includes both proprietary and third-party modeled outputs and related analysis to assist us in decision-making related to pricing and rate filings, catastrophe and non-catastrophe modeling, loss reserving, asset management, corporate tax, financial reporting, and risk and capital management, among other things. the modeled outputs and related analyses are subject to uncertainties and the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis, including model design errors; rely on numerous assumptions and the use of historical internal and industry data; and may lead to unintentional bias. in addition, climate change may make it more difficult to predict and model catastrophes, reducing our ability to accurately price our exposure to such events and mitigate risks. as a result, actual results may differ materially from our modeled results. if, based upon these models, we misprice our products, underestimate the frequency or severity of catastrophes and non-catastrophe losses, or fail to appropriately estimate the risks we are exposed to, which has occurred from time to time, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.
technology, cybersecurity and privacy risks the failure to effectively maintain and modernize our technology systems and infrastructure and integrate those of acquired businesses could adversely affect our business.
the success of our business depends on our ability to maintain effective, secure and reliable technology systems and infrastructure and to modernize them to support current and new clients and grow in an efficient and cost-effective manner. some of the company's technology systems and software are legacy-type systems that are less efficient and require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain or upgrade to current standards, including business continuity procedures. we are undergoing a multiyear transformation of our information technology systems and infrastructure involving several enterprise-wide technology initiatives to support our strategy and keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology and evolving industry and regulatory requirements. this includes implementing an integrated global financial system; enhancing existing systems, procedures and controls; developing new systems and products; and retiring certain legacy systems. we have also migrated many of our systems and applications to the cloud, which is key to our technology strategy. we currently rely on significant manual processes and procedures that subject us to increased risk of error and internal control failure compared to automated processes. we must integrate the systems of acquired businesses effectively so that technology gained through acquisitions meets the required level of security and performance capabilities to avoid additional risk to existing operations.
our ability to modernize our technology systems and infrastructure requires us to execute large-scale, complex programs and projects, which rely on the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources and effective planning and management processes. we may be unable to implement these programs and projects effectively, efficiently or in a timely manner, which could result in operational resiliency issues, poor customer experience, cost overruns, additional expenses, reputational harm, legal and regulatory actions, and other adverse consequences.
if we are unable to maintain technology systems, infrastructure, procedures (including technology continuity planning and recovery testing) and controls that function effectively without interruption and securely (including through a failure to replace or update redundant or obsolete hardware, applications or software systems), or to update or integrate our systems, we may not be able to service our clients and their customers, successfully offer our products, grow our business and account for transactions in an appropriate and timely manner, and our relationships with clients could be adversely affected. we are dependent on vendors and other third parties to maintain reliable and secure network systems that provide adequate speed and data capacity. for example, we utilize third-party cloud service providers in connection with certain key aspects of our business and operations, including in the global automotive businesses and in implementing an integrated global financial system, and any disruption of, or interference with, our use of such cloud services could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations. we have from time to time experienced operational resiliency issues, including the unavailability of technology systems upon which our clients rely. such failures could result in loss of business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. for risks relating to the security of our technology systems and cybersecurity incidents, see " - we could incur significant liability if our technology systems or those of third parties are breached or we or third parties otherwise fail to protect the security of data residing on our respective systems, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations."
we could incur significant liability if our technology systems or those of third parties are breached or we or third parties otherwise fail to protect the security of data residing on our respective systems, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
we rely on the uninterrupted and secure operation of our technology systems, including information technology systems and operational technology systems, to operate our business and securely process, transmit and store electronic information.
this electronic information includes confidential and other sensitive information, including personal data, that we receive from our customers, vendors and other third parties. our technology systems and safety control systems and those of our vendors and other third parties with whom we share sensitive information are vulnerable to, and in some cases have been subject to, damage or interruption from a variety of external threats, including cybersecurity incidents, computer viruses, malware and ransomware, as well as targeted attacks against our employees, which have been increasing in frequency.
cybersecurity incidents are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, partly due to the growing use of artificial intelligence by malicious actors. we are at risk of attack, and from time to time have been the subject of an attack, by a growing list of adversaries, including state-sponsored organizations, organized crime, hackers and "hacktivists" (activist hackers), through the use of increasingly sophisticated methods of attack, including long-term, persistent attacks referred to as advanced persistent threats, attacks via yet unknown vulnerabilities referred to as zero-day threats and credential harvesting attacks against our employees. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures, resulting in potential data loss or other damage to technology systems. as the breadth and complexity of the technologies we use continue to grow, and as a result of the remote and hybrid work arrangements for a significant portion of our employees, the risk of security breaches and cybersecurity incidents has increased.
our systems have also been subject to compromise from internal threats such as improper action by employees and third parties who may have otherwise legitimate access to our systems. our call centers subject us to additional risk from internal threats due to access to personal data. moreover, we face the ongoing challenge of managing access controls in a complex environment. remote and hybrid work arrangements, including the use of personal devices and home networks that are not managed by the organization's security control framework, bypass certain physical security controls for our employees and the employees of our vendors who have access to sensitive information. while additional controls have been put in place, they may not be sufficient to discover compromises that occur due to the loss of physical controls. the latency of a compromise is often measured in months, and we may not be able to detect a compromise in a timely manner. we could experience significant financial and reputational harm as a result of operational resiliency issues, including if our technology systems are breached, sensitive client or company data are compromised, modified, rendered inaccessible for any period of time or made public, or if we fail to make adequate disclosures to the public or law enforcement agencies following any such event.
our data protection measures may not be effective to protect our network and systems from external and internal threats. should an attacker gain access to our network using compromised credentials of an authorized user or otherwise, or gain entry as a result of a zero-day exploit or other vulnerabilities that may exist in our systems environment, which has occurred from time to time, we are at risk that the attacker might successfully leverage that access to compromise additional systems and data. certain measures that could increase the security of our systems take significant time and resources to deploy broadly and may not be effective against an attack. additionally, our policies, procedures and technical safeguards may be insufficient to prevent or detect improper access to confidential, personal or proprietary information and other cybersecurity incidents, assess the severity or impact of any such incidents or appropriately respond in a timely manner. the inability to implement, maintain and upgrade effective protective measures and other safeguards or adequately respond to a breach could have a material adverse effect on our business.
although we continue to invest in security and engage in best practices for software development, code vulnerabilities may still be introduced into production environments. our technology systems must be continually patched and upgraded to protect against vulnerabilities, including zero-day threats, and we are at risk that cyber attackers exploit these vulnerabilities before they have been addressed. due to the large number and age of the systems and platforms that we operate and the increased frequency with which vendors issue security patches to their products, the need to test patches and, in some cases coordinate with clients and vendors, before they can be deployed, we are at risk that we cannot deploy these patches to remediate these vulnerabilities in a timely and effective manner. we are dependent on vendors and other third parties, such as cloud service providers, to keep their systems patched in order to protect our data. we have vendors and other third parties who receive data from us in connection with the services we offer our customers. in addition, we have migrated certain data, and may increasingly migrate data, to the cloud hosted by third-party providers. we are at risk of a cybersecurity incident involving a vendor or other third party, which could result in a breakdown of such third party's data protection measures or access to our infrastructure through the third party. to the extent that a vendor or third party suffers a cybersecurity incident that compromises their operations, our data and our customers' data could be compromised or we may experience service interruption. any failure related to these activities and operational resiliency could have a material adverse effect on our business.
the process of integrating the technology systems of the businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk. for instance, we may not adequately identify weaknesses in an acquired entity's technology systems, either before or after the acquisition, which could affect the value we are able to derive from the acquisition, expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems more vulnerable to a cybersecurity incident. we may be unable to integrate the systems of the businesses we acquire into our environment in a timely manner, which could further increase these risks until such integration takes place.
we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity incidents, such as malware incursions, distributed denial of service attacks, hardware misconfigurations, zero-day exploits, credential harvesting, social engineering attacks, employee misconduct and incidents resulting from human error, such as loss of portable and other data storage devices. like many companies, we are subject to regular phishing email and social media engineering campaigns directed at our employees that have become more sophisticated and successful, partly through the use of artificial intelligence, and can result in malware infections and financial and data losses. although some of these incidents have resulted in data loss and other damages, to date, they have not had a material adverse effect on our business or operations. in the future, these types of incidents could result in confidential, restricted personal or proprietary information being lost or stolen, modified, rendered inaccessible for any period of time, or made public, including client, employee or company data, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
improper access to or disclosure of sensitive client or company information, which has occurred from time to time, could harm our reputation and subject us to significant liability under our contracts, as well as under existing or future laws, rules and regulations. in the event of a cybersecurity incident, we might have to take our systems offline, which could interfere with services to our clients or damage our reputation. in addition, our liability insurance policy, which includes cyber insurance, may not be sufficient in type or amount to fully cover us against claims and costs related to security breaches, cybersecurity incidents, and other related data and system incidents.
legal and regulatory risks we are subject to extensive laws and regulations, which increase our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business, and violations or alleged violations of such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations.
we are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the u.s. and its various states and territories, the e.u. and its member states, the u.k. and the other jurisdictions in which we operate. we are subject to anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, such as the fcpa and the u.k. anti-bribery act, trade sanctions, export control regulations and restrictions and anti-money laundering laws. we are subject to other laws and regulations on matters as diverse as antitrust, internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, accounting standards implemented by the financial accounting standards board and accounting-related rules and interpretations of the securities and exchange commission, environmental protection, wage-and-hour standards, and employment and labor relations. in addition, new or proposed environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, including those related to climate change, may result in expanded mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence and disclosure. there is also significant uncertainty in the evolving regulatory regime relating to artificial intelligence, and our current use and continued exploration of the use of this technology in our business may subject us to regulatory scrutiny, litigation, and social and ethical concerns.
our domestic and international insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulatory oversight, including: restrictions and requirements related to licensing; capital, surplus and dividends; underwriting limitations; the ability to enter, exit and continue to operate in markets; statutory accounting and other disclosure requirements; the ability to provide, terminate or cancel certain coverages; premium rates, including regulatory ability to disapprove or reduce the premium rates companies may charge; trade and claims practices; product forms, including regulatory ability to disapprove new product filings; content of disclosures to consumers; type, amount and valuation of investments; assessments or other surcharges for guaranty funds and companies' ability to recover assessments through premium increases; and market conduct and sales practices.
the u.s. and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our operations are complex and may change rapidly, and our efforts to comply with them require significant resources and increase the costs and risks of doing business. the regulations we are subject to have become more stringent over time, may decrease the need for our services, impose significant operational limits on our business and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. further, the laws and regulations affecting our business are subject to change as a result of, among other things, new interpretations and judicial decisions, and any such changes may increase the regulatory requirements imposed on us, impact the way we are able to do business, impact efforts to protect intellectual and other property, and significantly harm our business and results of operations. while we attempt to comply with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we or our employees, consultants, contractors and other agents are in full compliance with such laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws or regulations. if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, which occurs from time to time, we may be subject to investigations, criminal penalties, civil remedies or other adverse consequences, including fines, injunctions, loss of an operating license or approval, increased scrutiny or oversight by regulatory authorities, the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in a particular business, redress to clients, exposure to negative publicity or reputational damage and harm to client, employee and other relationships. moreover, our failure to comply with laws or regulations in one jurisdiction may result in increased regulatory scrutiny by other regulatory agencies in that jurisdiction or regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions. the costs of compliance and the consequences of non-compliance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. for additional discussion of the various laws and regulations affecting our business, see "item 1 - business - regulation" in this report.
changes in tax laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
federal, state or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, are subject to significant change and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. for example, in 2022, the inflation reduction act (the "ira"), which introduced a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax applicable to corporations in certain situations and a 1% excise tax on corporate share repurchases, among other things, was enacted. compliance with the ira may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company, the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements, the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions and increase costs. in addition, the organization for economic co-operation and development's (the "oecd") efforts around global pillars i and ii dealing with possible new digital taxes and global minimum taxes could increase the company's overall tax burden, adversely impacting the company's business, results of operations and financial condition. as part of the oecd's global pillar ii rules, the oecd recommended a 15% global minimum tax on adjusted financial reported income. many jurisdictions, including japan, the european union and the united kingdom, have adopted or plan to adopt global pillar ii for tax years beginning in 2024. the overall impact of the ira and the oecd's global pillar i and ii rules is uncertain due to the ambiguities in the application of certain provisions, the impact of future guidance, interpretations or rules issued by government agencies and potential court decisions interpreting the legislation. future changes in tax laws, including changes in the application or interpretation of the ira, the oecd's global pillar i and ii rules, or increases to the corporate tax rate, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions.
from time to time, we may be, and in certain cases have been, subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to our current and past business operations, including:
•industry-wide investigations regarding business practices, including the use and marketing of certain types of insurance policies or certificates of insurance, and compliance with guidance issued by regulators;
•actions by regulatory authorities that may restrict our ability to increase or maintain our premium rates, require us to reduce premium rates, require us to allow customers to defer premium payments on certain of our products, make offering our products more expensive or unattractive to our clients, impose fines or penalties, and result in other expenses;
•market conduct examinations, for which we are required to pay the expenses of the regulator as well as our own expenses, and which may result in fines, penalties, and other adverse consequences;
•disputes regarding our lender-placed insurance products, including those relating to rates, agent compensation, consumer disclosure, continuous coverage requirements, loan tracking services and other services that we provide to mortgage servicers;
•disputes over coverage or claims adjudication, including in our sharing economy business;
•disputes over our treatment of claims, in which states or insureds may allege that we failed to make required payments or meet prescribed deadlines for adjudicating claims;
•disputes regarding regulatory compliance, sales practices, disclosures, premium refunds, licensing, underwriting and compensation arrangements, including if our climate change mitigation plans and targets are not met;
•disputes over liability claims under comprehensive general liability policies involving property damage or personal injury at insured properties or relating to insured vehicles;
•disputes alleging bundling of credit insurance and extended service contracts and related products with other products provided by financial institutions;
•disputes with tax and insurance authorities regarding our tax liabilities;
•investigations alleging violations of fraud, sanctions, money laundering and/or export control laws;
•disputes relating to customers' claims that they were not aware of the full cost or existence of the insurance or limitations on insurance coverage;
•disputes relating to protecting our intellectual property portfolio and by third parties alleging intellectual property infringement; and
•employment litigation claims brought by current or former employees.
further, actions by certain regulators may cause additional changes to the structure of the lender-placed insurance industry, including the arrangements under which we track coverage on mortgaged properties. these changes could materially adversely affect the results of operations of global housing and the results of operations and financial condition of the company. for additional information, see "item 1 - business - regulation" in this report.
we are involved in a variety of litigation and legal and regulatory proceedings relating to our current and past business operations and may, from time to time, become involved in other such actions. we continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these proceedings.
we participate in settlements on terms that we consider reasonable; however, the results of any pending or future litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable and involve significant uncertainty. unfavorable outcomes in litigation or regulatory proceedings or significant problems in our relationships with regulators could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, reputation, ratings and ability to continue to do business. they could expose us to further investigations or litigation. in addition, certain of our clients in the mortgage, auto financing, credit card and banking industries are the subject of various regulatory investigations and litigation matters regarding mortgage lending practices, credit insurance, debt-deferment and debt cancellation products, and the sale of protection products, which could indirectly negatively affect our businesses. for additional information, see "item 3 - legal proceedings" and note 28 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
the costs of complying with, or our failure to comply with, u.s. and foreign laws related to privacy, data security and data protection could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and reputation.
in providing services and solutions to our customers and operating our business, we process, store and transfer sensitive customer, end-consumer and company data, including personal data, in and across multiple jurisdictions. as a result, we are or may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the u.s. and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data security. for discussion of the various laws and regulations affecting our business, see "item 1 - business - regulation" in this report. the scope and interpretation of these laws and additional laws that are or may be applicable to us are continuously evolving, often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time and may restrict the way services involving data are offered, all of which may adversely affect our results of operations. complying with these and similar laws and regulations requires us to make significant changes to our operations, which rely on the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources and effective planning and management processes. we may be unable to implement required operational changes effectively, efficiently or in a timely manner, which could result in cost overruns, additional expenses, reputational harm, legal and regulatory actions and other adverse consequences.
unauthorized disclosure or transfer of personal or otherwise sensitive data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud, misappropriation or other means, by us, our vendors or other parties with whom we do business could subject us to significant litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, criminal prosecution and other adverse consequences in one or more jurisdictions. such events could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation and cause us to lose clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
our business is subject to risks related to reductions in the insurance premium rates we charge.
we file rates with the state departments of insurance in the ordinary course of business. the rates associated with the premiums we charge are subject to review by regulators. the results of such reviews vary, and regulators could require us to reduce our rates based on various factors, including if they consider our loss ratios to be too low. significant rate reductions could materially reduce our profitability.
from time to time we have engaged in discussions and proceedings with certain state regulators regarding our lender-placed insurance business. as previously disclosed, we completed a regulatory settlement agreement (the "rsa") in 2017 to resolve a targeted multistate market conduct examination focused on lender-placed insurance, which includes a number of requirements and restrictions that are applicable in all participating states and u.s. territories. among other things, the terms of the rsa require more frequent rate filings for lender-placed insurance. this could result in downward pressure on premium rates for these products. if such filings result in significant decreases in premium rates for our lender-placed insurance products, our cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
changes in insurance regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth.
legislation or other regulatory reform related to the insurance industry that increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we are able to do business may significantly harm our business or results of operations. various state and federal regulatory authorities have taken actions with respect to our lender-placed insurance business, including the multistate market conduct examination and related rsa in 2017. if we were unable for any reason to comply with any new or revised requirements, including the rsa, it could result in substantial costs to us and ongoing reporting and monitoring obligations, and may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, new interpretations of existing laws or new judicial decisions affecting the insurance industry could adversely affect our business.
insurance industry-related legislative or regulatory changes that could significantly harm our subsidiaries and us include:
•imposed reductions in premium rates, limitations on the ability to raise premiums on existing policies, limitations on the ability to provide evergreen contracts or new minimum loss ratios;
•increases in minimum capital, reserves, liquidity, solvency and other financial viability requirements, such as rbc standards established by the naic (each as defined hereafter);
•enhanced or new regulatory requirements intended to prevent future financial crises or to otherwise ensure the stability of institutions;
•new licensing requirements;
•restrictions on the ability to offer certain types of insurance products, service contracts or other protection products;
•prohibitions or limitations on provider financial incentives and provider risk-sharing arrangements;
•more stringent standards of review for claims denials or coverage determinations;
•increased regulation relating to lender-placed insurance; and
•new or enhanced regulatory requirements that require insurers to pay claims on terms other than those mandated by underlying policy contracts.
in addition, regulators in certain states have hired third-party auditors to audit the unclaimed property records of insurance companies operating in those states. among other companies, we are currently subject to these audits in a number of states and have been responding to information requests from these auditors.
general risk factors our common stock may be subject to stock price and trading volume volatility.
our common stock price and trading volume has from time to time and could in the future materially fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, including: variations in our quarterly operating results, including against expectations; client or business losses; catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses; the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies; changes in our insurance subsidiaries' financial strength ratings; changes in our corporate debt ratings; changes to our registered securities; limitations on premium levels or the ability to maintain or raise premiums on existing policies; regulatory developments affecting our products or services; and negative publicity relating to us or our competitors. in addition, macroeconomic, geopolitical conflicts and industry fluctuations, including the current inflationary environment, may materially and adversely affect the trading price or volume of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.
employee misconduct could harm us by subjecting us to significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.
our ability to attract, recruit, hire, motivate, develop and retain employees and clients depends upon our corporate culture. our employees are the cornerstone of our culture and acts of misconduct by any employee, and particularly by senior management, could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation. our employees could engage or be accused of engaging in misconduct that subjects us to litigation, regulatory sanctions, financial costs and serious harm to our reputation or financial position. employee misconduct could prompt regulators to allege or determine, on the basis of such misconduct, that we have not established an adequate program to inform employees of applicable rules or to detect and deter violations of such rules. it is not always possible to deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective. misconduct by employees, or even unsubstantiated allegations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, reputation and business.
applicable laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage takeovers and business combinations that some stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.
applicable laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may delay, defer, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests. for example, section 203 of the general corporation law of the state of delaware may limit the ability of an "interested stockholder" to engage in business combinations with us. an interested stockholder is defined to include persons owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. these provisions may make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our directors, which could delay, defer or prevent a change in control. such provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging future takeover attempts.
additionally, applicable state and foreign insurance laws may require prior approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer. state statutes generally provide, and certain foreign statutes provide, that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist when any person directly or indirectly owns, controls, has voting power over, or holds proxies representing, 10% or more of the domestic insurer's voting securities. the application process can be extensive, thereby discouraging the acquisition of a control position.
our certificate of incorporation or by-laws contain provisions that permit the board to issue one or more series of preferred stock, prohibit stockholders from filling vacancies on the board, prohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders and from taking action by written consent and impose advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at stockholder meetings.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report. it contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results might differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly under the headings "item 1a - risk factors" and "forward-looking statements."
general segment information as of december 31, 2023, we had two reportable operating segments which are defined based on the manner in which the company's chief operating decision maker, our ceo, reviews the business to assess performance and allocate resources, and which align to the nature of the products and services offered:
•global lifestyle: includes mobile device solutions (including extended service contracts, insurance policies and related services), extended service contracts and related services for consumer electronics and appliances, and credit and other insurance products (referred to as "connected living"); and vehicle protection services, commercial equipment services and other related services (referred to as "global automotive"); and
•global housing: includes lender-placed homeowners, manufactured housing and flood insurance, as well as voluntary manufactured housing, condominium and homeowners insurance (referred to as "homeowners"); and renters insurance and other products (referred to as "renters and other").
in addition, we report the corporate and other segment, which includes corporate employee-related expenses and activities of the holding company.
we define adjusted ebitda, our segment measure of profitability, as net income from continuing operations, excluding net realized gains (losses) on investments and fair value changes to equity securities, non-core operations (which consists of certain businesses which we have fully exited or expect to fully exit, including the long-tail commercial liability businesses (sharing economy and small commercial businesses), as well as certain legacy long-duration insurance policies and our operations in mainland china), restructuring costs related to strategic exit activities (outside of normal periodic restructuring and cost management activities), assurant health runoff operations, interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization of purchased intangible assets, as well as other highly variable or unusual items.
the following discussion covers the year ended december 31, 2023 ("twelve months 2023") and the year ended december 31, 2022 ("twelve months 2022"). please see the discussion that follows, for each of these segments, for a more detailed comparative analysis. our comparative analysis of twelve months 2022 and the year ended december 31, 2021 is included under the heading "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2022 filed with the sec on february 17, 2023.
executive summary summary of financial results consolidated net income increased $365.9 million, or 132%, to $642.5 million for twelve months 2023 from $276.6 million for twelve months 2022, primarily due to higher global housing segment earnings, including lower reportable catastrophes (defined as individual catastrophic events that generate losses in excess of $5.0 million pre-tax, net of reinsurance and client profit sharing adjustments, and including reinstatement and other premiums), and lower net unrealized losses from changes in the fair value of equity securities.
global lifestyle adjusted ebitda decreased $17.1 million, or 2%, to $792.3 million for twelve months 2023 from $809.4 million for twelve months 2022. the decline was driven by global automotive as elevated claims costs were partially offset by higher investment income. connected living results were up modestly, as stronger mobile device protection results in north america and higher investment income were partially offset by lower mobile results in asia pacific.
global lifestyle net earned premiums, fees and other income increased $499.5 million, or 6%, to $8.56 billion for the twelve months 2023 from $8.06 billion for twelve months 2022, primarily due to prior period sales within global automotive.
global housing adjusted ebitda increased $328.2 million, or 133%, to $574.2 million for twelve months 2023 from $246.0 million for twelve months 2022, primarily driven by the factors noted below, including $60.4 million of lower pre-tax reportable catastrophes. excluding reportable catastrophes, adjusted ebitda increased $267.8 million, or 64%, mainly due to lower non-catastrophe loss experience, including $54.1 million of favorable prior year reserve development in 2023 compared to $15.5 million of unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2022. strong top-line growth in homeowners and expense leverage from scale and operational efficiencies also drove performance.
global housing net earned premiums, fees and other income increased $258.3 million, or 14%, to $2.14 billion for twelve months 2023 from $1.88 billion for twelve months 2022, largely driven by homeowners top-line growth, which was driven by higher average premiums and growth in policies-in-force within lender-placed insurance.
corporate and other adjusted ebitda was $(109.0) million for twelve months 2023 compared to $(99.2) million for twelve months 2022, primarily driven by lower investment income and higher employee-related expenses.
critical factors affecting results our results depend on, among other things, the appropriateness of our product pricing, underwriting, the accuracy of our reserving methodology for future policyholder benefits and claims, the frequency and severity of reportable and non-reportable catastrophes, returns on and values of invested assets, our investment income, and our ability to realize greater operational efficiencies and manage our expenses. our results also depend on our ability to profitably grow our businesses, including our connected living and global automotive businesses, and the performance of our homeowners business. factors affecting these items, including conditions in the financial markets, the global economy, political conditions and the markets in which we operate, fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates and inflation, including the current period of inflationary pressures which have impacted claims costs primarily in the homeowners and the global automotive businesses, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. for more information on these and other factors that could affect our results, see "item 1a - risk factors."
our results may also be impacted by our ability to continue to grow in the markets in which we operate, including in our connected living and global automotive businesses, which will be impacted by our ability to provide a superior digital-first customer experience, including from our investments in technology and digital initiatives, capitalize on the connected home opportunity and investments to onboard and ramp-up new business. our mobile business is subject to volatility in mobile device trade-in volumes and margins based on the actual and anticipated timing of the release of new devices, carrier promotional programs and sales prices for used devices, as well as to changes in consumer preferences. our homeowners revenue is impacted by changes in the housing market. in addition, across many of our businesses, we must respond to competitive pressures, including the threat of disruption and competition for talent, which has increased due to labor shortages and wage inflation. see "item 1a - risk factors - business, strategic and operational risks - significant competitive pressures, changes in customer preferences and disruption could adversely affect our results of operations," " - our mobile business is subject to the risk of declines in the value and availability of mobile devices, and to regulatory compliance and other risks" and " - the success of our business depends on the execution of our strategy, including through the continuing service of key executives, senior leaders, highly-skilled personnel and a high-performing workforce."
for twelve months 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.14 billion; net cash used in investing activities was $637.7 million; and net cash used in financing activities was $403.9 million. we had $1.63 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2023. please see " - liquidity and capital resources" below for further details.
revenues we generate revenues primarily from the sale of our insurance policies, service contracts and related products and services, and from income earned on our investments. sales of insurance policies are recognized in revenue as earned premiums while sales of administrative services are recognized as fee income.
our premium and fee income is supplemented by income earned from our investment portfolio. we recognize revenue from interest payments, dividends, change in market value of equity securities and sales of investments. currently, our investment portfolio is primarily invested in fixed maturity securities. both investment income and changes in market value on these investments can be significantly affected by changes in interest rates.
interest rate volatility can increase or reduce unrealized gains or losses in our investment portfolios. interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, inflation and other factors beyond our control. fluctuations in interest rates affect our returns on, and the market value of, fixed maturity and short-term investments.
the fair market value of the fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio and the investment income from these securities fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions. the fair market value generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us from future investments in fixed maturity securities generally increases or decreases with fluctuations in interest rates. we also have investments that are subject to pre-payment risk, such as mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. interest rate fluctuations may cause actual net investment income and/or timing of cash flows from such investments to differ from estimates made at the time of investment. in periods of declining interest rates, mortgage prepayments generally increase and mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage obligations and bonds are more likely to be prepaid or redeemed as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates. therefore, in these circumstances we may be required to reinvest those funds in lower interest-earning investments.
please see "item 7a - quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" below for further details.
expenses our expenses are primarily policyholder benefits, underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses and interest expense.
policyholder benefits are affected by our claims management programs, reinsurance coverage, contractual terms and conditions, regulatory requirements, economic conditions including inflation, and numerous other factors. benefits paid or reserves required for future benefits could substantially exceed our expectations, causing a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of commissions, premium taxes, licenses, fees, amortization of deferred costs, general operating expenses and income taxes. in addition to the restructuring plan announced in december 2022 and amended in 2023, we continue to undertake various expense savings initiatives while also making investments in talent, capabilities and technology, among other things, which will impact our expenses.
we also incur interest expense related to our debt.
critical accounting policies and estimates certain items in our consolidated financial statements are based on estimates and judgment. differences between actual results and these estimates and judgments could in some cases have material impacts on our consolidated financial statements. the following critical accounting policies require significant estimates and judgment:
•reserves, net of reinsurance
•valuation of investments
•valuation and recoverability of goodwill reserves, net of reinsurance reserves are established using generally accepted actuarial methods and reflect significant judgment and estimates about expected future claim payments. factors used in their calculation include experience derived from historical claim payments and actuarial assumptions. calculations incorporate assumptions about the incidence of incurred claims, the extent to which all claims have been reported, reporting lags, expenses, inflation rates, future investment earnings, internal claims processing costs and other relevant factors. while the methods of making such estimates and establishing the related liabilities are periodically reviewed and updated, the estimation of reserves includes an element of uncertainty given that management is using historical information and methods to project future events and reserve outcomes.
the recorded reserves represent our best estimate at a point in time of the ultimate costs of settlement and administration of a claim or group of claims, based upon actuarial assumptions and projections using facts and circumstances known at the time of calculation. the adequacy of reserves may be impacted by future trends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. these variables are affected by both external and internal events, including: changes in the economic cycle, inflation, changes in repair costs, natural or human-made catastrophes, judicial trends, legislative changes and claims handling procedures.
many of these items are not directly quantifiable and not all future events can be anticipated when reserves are established. reserve estimates are refined as experience develops. adjustments to reserves, both positive and negative, are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such estimates are updated.
because establishment of reserves is an inherently complex process involving significant judgment and estimates, there can be no certainty that future settlement amounts for claims incurred through the financial reporting date will not vary from reported claims reserves. future loss development could require reserves to be increased or decreased, which could have a material effect on our earnings in the periods in which such increases or decreases are made. however, based on information currently available, we believe our reserve estimates are adequate. see "item 1a - risk factors - financial risks - our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims, requiring us to establish additional reserves or to incur additional expense for settling unreserved liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, profitability and capital" and " - financial risks - actual results may differ materially from the analytical models we use to assist in our decision-making in key areas such as pricing, catastrophe risks, reserving and capital management" for more detail on this risk.
reinsurance recoverables we utilize reinsurance for loss protection and capital management, business dispositions and client risk and profit sharing. reinsurance premiums paid are amortized as reductions to premium over the terms of the underlying reinsured policies. amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves. reinsurance recoverables include amounts we are owed by reinsurers for claims paid as well as those included in reserve estimates that are subject to the reinsurance.
we use a probability of default and loss given default methodology in estimating an expected credit loss allowance, whereby the credit ratings of reinsurers are used in determining the probability of default. the allowance is established for reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid future policy benefits and claims and benefits. prior to applying default factors, the net exposure to credit risk is reduced for any collateral for which the right of offset exists, such as funds withheld, assets held in trust and letters of credit, which are part of the reinsurance arrangements, with adjustments to include consideration of credit exposure on the collateral. our methodology incorporates historical default factors for each reinsurer based on their credit rating using comparably rated bonds as published by a major ratings service. the allowance is based upon our ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing and other relevant factors.
in the ordinary course of business, we are involved in both the assumption and cession of reinsurance with non-affiliated companies. the following table provides details of the reinsurance recoverables balance as of december 31, 2023 and 2022:

short duration contracts claims and benefits payable reserves for short duration contracts include (1) case reserves for known claims which are unpaid as of the balance sheet date; (2) ibnr reserves for claims where the insured event has occurred but has not been reported to us as of the balance sheet date; and (3) loss adjustment expense reserves for the expected handling costs of settling the claims. periodically, we review emerging experience and make adjustments to our reserves and assumptions where necessary.
ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses are estimated utilizing generally accepted actuarial loss reserving methods. both paid claims development as well as case incurred development are typically analyzed at the product or product grouping level, considering product size and data credibility. the reserving methods widely employed by us include the chain ladder, munich chain ladder and bornhuetter-ferguson methods. for global housing, reportable catastrophes are analyzed and reserved for separately using a frequency and severity approach.
the methods all involve aggregating paid and case-incurred loss data by accident quarter (or accident year) and accident age for each product grouping. as the data ages, development factors are calculated that measure emerging claim development patterns between reporting periods. by selecting loss development factors indicative of remaining development, known losses are projected to an ultimate incurred basis for each accident period. the underlying premise of the chain ladder method is that future claims development is best estimated using past claims development, whereas the bornhuetter-ferguson method employs a combination of past claims development and prior estimates of ultimate losses based on an expected loss ratio. the munich chain ladder method incorporates the correlations between paid and incurred development in projecting future development factors, and is typically more applicable to products experiencing variability in incurred to paid ratios.
each of these methods applied to the data groupings produces an estimate of the loss reserves for the product grouping. the best estimate is generally selected from a blend of the different methods. the ibnr associated with the best estimate is then allocated to accident year based on a weighting of the underlying actuarial methods. the determination of the best estimate is based on many factors, including:
•the nature and extent of the underlying assumptions;
•the quality and applicability of historical data - whether internal or industry data;
•current and expected future economic and market conditions;
•regulatory, legislative, and judicial considerations;
•the extent of data segmentation - data should be homogeneous yet credible enough for loss development methods to apply;
•trends in loss frequency and severity for various causes of loss;
•consideration of the distribution of loss reserves, management's selection of the best estimate that may exceed an estimate based on median values, suggesting that favorable development may be more likely than unfavorable development; and
•hindsight testing of prior loss estimates - the loss estimates on some product lines will vary from actual loss experience more than others.
when employing the reserving methods, consideration is given to contractual requirements, historical utilization trends and payment patterns, coverage changes, seasonality, product mix, the legislative and regulatory environment, economic factors, natural catastrophes and other relevant factors. we consistently apply reserving principles and methodologies from year to year, while also giving due consideration to the potential variability of these factors.
while management has used judgment in establishing its best estimate of required reserves, different assumptions and variables could lead to significantly different reserve estimates. two key measures of loss activity are loss frequency, which is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure, and loss severity, which is a measure of the average size of claims. factors affecting loss frequency include the effectiveness of loss controls, changes in economic activity and weather patterns. factors affecting loss severity include changes in policy limits, retentions, rate of inflation and judicial interpretations.
if the actual level of loss frequency and severity are higher or lower than expected, the ultimate reserves required will be different than management's estimate. the effect of higher and lower levels of loss frequency and severity on our ultimate costs for claims occurring in 2023 would be as follows:

non-core operations short duration contracts in non-core operations primarily consist of the sharing economy and small commercial products previously reported within global housing. while the contracts are classified as short duration, the coverages were predominantly commercial liability and have a long reporting and settlement tail compared to property coverages which make up most of our core operations.
the reserving methodology described for other short duration contacts is applicable for non-core operations. given the nature of commercial liability coverages and its relatively long claim runoff duration, additional emphasis is placed on elevated loss activity from increasing attorney involvement and analysis of individual case reserve adequacy on known claims. this is done through use of average cost per claim methods that include an allowance for future inflation impacts, detailed open claim inventory analysis, and leveraging industry development patterns to supplement our own historical claims experience.
long duration contracts, including disposed and runoff long duration lines reserves for future policy benefits represent the present value of future benefits to policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums. reserve assumptions reflect best estimates for expected investment yield, inflation, mortality, morbidity, expenses and withdrawal rates. these assumptions are based on our experience to the extent it is credible, modified where appropriate to reflect current trends, industry experience and provisions for possible unfavorable deviation. we also record an unearned revenue reserve which represents premiums received which have not yet been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations.
risks related to the reserves recorded for certain discontinued individual life, annuity and long-term care insurance policies have been fully ceded via reinsurance. while we have not been released from our contractual obligation to the policyholders, changes in and deviations from economic, mortality, morbidity, and withdrawal assumptions used in the calculation of these reserves will not directly affect our results of operations unless there is a default by the assuming reinsurer.
valuation of investments in determining the estimated fair value of our investments, fair values are primarily based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical investments in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable. when such unadjusted quoted prices are not available, estimated fair values are based on quoted prices for identical or similar investments in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs. if these observable inputs are not available, or observable inputs are not determinable, unobservable inputs or adjustments to observable inputs requiring management judgment are used to determine the estimated fair value of investments. the methodologies, assumptions and inputs utilized are described in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. our ability to sell investments and the price ultimately realized for investments depends upon the demand and liquidity in the market.
see also notes 2, 8 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, "item 1a - risk factors - financial risks - our investment portfolio is subject to credit, liquidity and other risks that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition" and " - investments" contained in this item 7.
valuation and recoverability of goodwill our goodwill related to acquisitions of businesses was $2.61 billion and $2.60 billion as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. we review our goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. such indicators include: a significant adverse change in legal factors, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, loss of key personnel or a significant decline in our expected future cash flows due to changes in company-specific factors or the broader business climate. the evaluation of such factors requires considerable management judgment. any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is either at the operating segment or one level below, if that component is a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews such information. components within an operating segment can be aggregated into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics. a goodwill impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value, including goodwill, of the reporting unit over its fair value. an impairment loss is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
our global lifestyle operating segment is disaggregated into two reporting units: connected living and global automotive. our reporting unit for goodwill testing was at the same level as the operating segment for global housing.
the following table illustrates the amount of goodwill carried by operating segment as of the dates indicated:

total                         $2,608.8                      $2,603.0
(1)as of december 31, 2023, $785.2 million and $1,506.9 million of goodwill was assigned to the connected living and global automotive reporting units, respectively. as of december 31, 2022, $761.0 million and $1,432.9 million of goodwill was assigned to the connected living (including global financial services which was aggregated with connected living in 2023) and global automotive reporting units, respectively.
quantitative impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed a quantitative assessment for the global lifestyle and global housing reporting units given the uncertainty in macro-economic conditions and inflation concerns. based on this quantitative assessment, the company determined that it was more likely than not that the reporting units' fair values were more than their carrying amounts and that there was no impairment for the global lifestyle and global housing reporting units as of october 1, 2023.
the determination of fair value of the reporting units requires many estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions include earnings and required capital projections discussed above, discount rates, terminal growth rates, operating income and dividend forecasts for each reporting unit and the weighting assigned to the results of each valuation method included in the fair value calculation. changes in certain assumptions could have a significant impact on the goodwill impairment assessment.
should the operating results of these reporting units decline substantially compared to projected results, or should further interest rate declines increase the net unrealized investment portfolio gain position, we could determine that we need to perform an updated impairment test due to the potential impairment indicators, which may require the recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in any of the reporting units.
for the fourth quarter of 2023 quantitative assessment, had the net book value for the reporting units exceeded its estimated fair value, the company would have recognized a goodwill impairment loss for the difference up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.

year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the year ended december 31, 2022
net income consolidated net income increased $365.9 million, or 132%, to $642.5 million for twelve months 2023 from $276.6 million for twelve months 2022, primarily driven by higher lender-placed net earned premiums and lower non-catastrophe loss experience in our homeowners business within global housing, a $104.3 million decrease in after-tax net unrealized losses from changes in the fair value of equity securities and $47.6 million of lower after-tax reportable catastrophes. also contributing to the increase was a $24.7 million after-tax decline in losses related to our non-core operations and a $14.7 million reduction in after-tax restructuring costs related to our previously announced restructuring plan. the increase in net income was partially offset by higher after-tax depreciation expenses of $18.2 million, mainly due to higher software assets placed into service, lower earnings from global lifestyle, mainly due to ongoing elevated claims in global automotive, and $12.7 million of higher losses from foreign exchange from the remeasurement of net monetary assets in argentina, due to the country's classification as a highly inflationary economy.

adjusted ebitda decreased $17.1 million, or 2%, to $792.3 million for twelve months 2023 from $809.4 million for twelve months 2022, primarily due to ongoing elevated claims costs in global automotive, including higher labor and parts costs due to inflation and unfavorable loss experience in select ancillary products, lower mobile results in asia pacific, including the impact of foreign exchange, and lower profitability in extended service contracts. the decline was partially offset by higher net investment income across global lifestyle and stronger mobile device protection results in north america.
total revenues increased $593.4 million, or 7%, to $8.91 billion for twelve months 2023 from $8.32 billion for twelve months 2022. net earned premiums increased $410.3 million, or 6%, primarily driven by continued domestic organic growth from prior period sales in our global automotive business across all distribution channels. net earned premium from connected living increased modestly, mainly from organic growth across all products, partially offset by the impact of a previously disclosed mobile program contract change that resulted in lower retention of premiums net of reinsurance, as well as the run-off of certain global mobile programs. net investment income increased $93.9 million, or 37%, primarily due to higher yields on cash, short-term investments and fixed maturity securities. fees and other income increased $89.2 million, or 8%, mainly driven by higher average selling prices on mobile trade-in programs, as well as contributions from new programs, partially offset by a mobile program contract change related to our in-store mobile service and repair business.
total benefits, losses and expenses increased $610.5 million, or 8%, to $8.12 billion for twelve months 2023 from $7.51 billion for twelve months 2022. underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $359.2 million, or 6%, mainly due to higher commission expenses from growth across global lifestyle, primarily in global automotive, higher cost of sales in our global mobile business and higher information technology and employee-related expenses to support growth, partially offset by a mobile program contract change related to our in-store mobile service and repair business. policyholder benefits increased $251.3 million, or 19%, primarily due to ongoing elevated claims costs in global automotive, as described above, partially offset by a mobile program contract change that resulted in lower retention of losses net of reinsurance.

adjusted ebitda increased $328.2 million, or 133%, to $574.2 million for twelve months 2023 from $246.0 million for twelve months 2022, mainly due to growth in homeowners from higher lender-placed average insured values, policies in force and premium rates; a $60.4 million decrease in reportable catastrophes; lower non-catastrophe loss experience, including $54.1 million of favorable reserve development in twelve months 2023 compared to $15.5 million of adverse reserve development in twelve months 2022; and higher net investment income. the increase was partially offset by exits from certain international markets and higher catastrophe reinsurance costs primarily from restructuring the program.
total revenues increased $292.2 million, or 15%, to $2.25 billion for twelve months 2023 from $1.96 billion for twelve months 2022. net earned premiums increased $262.9 million, or 15%, primarily driven by homeowners from higher lender-placed average insured values and policies in force, as well as higher premium rates primarily to address increased claims severity, and the absence of $32.8 million of unfavorable catastrophe reinstatement premiums from twelve months 2022 compared to a favorable adjustment of $5.1 million in twelve months 2023, partially offset by exits from certain international markets. net investment income increased $33.9 million, or 45%, primarily due to higher yields on fixed maturity securities, cash and short-term investments, partially offset by lower gains from the sales of real estate joint venture partnerships. the increase in total revenues was partially offset by a decrease in fees and other income of $4.6 million, or 3%, mainly driven by a decline in renters and other from lower installment fees.
total benefits, losses and expenses decreased $36.0 million, or 2%, to $1.68 billion for twelve months 2023 from $1.71 billion for twelve months 2022. policyholder benefits decreased $22.1 million, or 2%, primarily due to lower reportable catastrophe losses and favorable non-catastrophe prior year reserve development, partially offset by higher current year non-catastrophe loss experience from business growth and higher severity. underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $13.9 million, or 2%, primarily due to exits from certain international markets, higher reimbursements related to the national flood insurance program for processing flood claims for hurricane ian and a discretionary benefit from the federal emergency management agency.

year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the year ended december 31, 2022
adjusted ebitda was $(109.0) million for twelve months 2023 compared to $(99.2) million for twelve months 2022. the increase in the loss was primarily due to lower net investment income, mostly due to lower invested assets from the use of the global preneed sale proceeds in twelve months 2022 for share repurchases, and higher employee-related expenses.
total revenues decreased $5.8 million, or 21%, to $21.6 million for twelve months 2023 from $27.4 million for twelve months 2022, primarily driven by a decrease in net investment income of $5.5 million, or 20%, mostly due to lower invested assets from the use of the global preneed sale proceeds in twelve months 2022 for share repurchases, partially offset by higher cash yields.
total benefits, losses and expenses increased $4.0 million, or 3%, to $130.6 million for twelve months 2023 from $126.6 million for twelve months 2022, primarily due to an increase in general and administrative expenses of $4.4 million, or 3%, primarily due to higher employee-related expenses, partially offset by the reduction of expenses from a subsidiary that was sold in second quarter 2022.
investments we had total investments of $8.22 billion and $7.52 billion as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. net unrealized losses on our fixed maturity securities portfolio decreased $256.8 million during twelve months 2023, from a $637.1 million unrealized loss at december 31, 2022 to a $380.3 million unrealized loss at december 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in treasury yields.

net investment income increased $125.0 million, or 34%, to $489.1 million for twelve months 2023 from $364.1 million for twelve months 2022. the increase was primarily driven by higher yields and assets in fixed maturity securities, short term investments and cash and cash equivalents.
net realized losses on investments and fair value changes to equity securities were $68.7 million for twelve months 2023 compared to net realized losses on investments and fair value changes to equity securities of $179.7 million for twelve months 2022. the change in twelve months 2023 was primarily driven by changes in the fair value of equity securities and lower sales of fixed maturity securities, partially offset by a decrease in realized gains on sales of equity securities.
as of december 31, 2023, we owned $17.8 million of securities guaranteed by financial guarantee insurance companies. included in this amount was $16.0 million of municipal securities, whose credit rating was a+ with the guarantee, but would have had a rating of aa- without the guarantee.
for more information on our investments, see notes 8 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
liquidity and capital resources the following section discusses our ability to generate cash flows from each of our subsidiaries, borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet our operating and growth needs. management believes that we will have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our needs over the next twelve months, including the ability to pay interest on our debt and dividends on our common stock.
during third quarter 2023, we submitted an agreement to sell our miami, florida office (the "agreement") to a potential acquiror, which is subject to review, approval, execution and other conditions. if the transaction is consummated pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we expect to record a gain in 2024 above the current carrying value of $46.0 million as of december 31, 2023. we do not anticipate that the gain will impact our capital deployment priorities. the entry into a definitive agreement and the consummation of the transaction are subject to significant uncertainty. there can be no assurance that a definitive agreement will be executed or that any transaction will be approved or consummated.
regulatory requirements assurant, inc. is a holding company and, as such, has limited direct operations of its own. our assets consist primarily of the capital stock of our subsidiaries. accordingly, our future cash flows depend upon the availability of dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries, such as payments under our tax allocation agreement and under management agreements with our subsidiaries. our subsidiaries' ability to pay such dividends and make such other payments is regulated by the states and territories in which our subsidiaries are domiciled. these dividend regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and by type of insurance provided by the applicable subsidiary, but generally require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends they can pay to the holding company. see "item 1a - risk factors - legal and regulatory risks - changes in insurance regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth." along with solvency regulations, the primary driver in determining the amount of capital used for dividends from insurance subsidiaries is the level of capital needed to maintain desired financial strength ratings from a.m. best. for the year ending december 31, 2024, the maximum amount of dividends our regulated u.s. domiciled insurance subsidiaries could pay us, under applicable laws and regulations without prior regulatory approval, is approximately $592.4 million. our international and non-insurance subsidiaries provide additional sources of dividends.
regulators or rating agencies could become more conservative in their methodology and criteria, increasing capital requirements for our insurance subsidiaries or the enterprise.
in september 2023, the following actions were taken by a.m. best:
•upgraded the insurance financial strength ratings on our insurance operating subsidiaries, american bankers insurance company of florida, american security insurance company, caribbean american property insurance company, voyager indemnity insurance company, virginia surety company, inc, and reliable lloyds insurance company, to a+ from a with a stable outlook.
•upgraded our short-term issuer credit ratings on commercial paper to amb-1+ from amb-1 with a stable outlook.
•upgraded our long-term issuer credit ratings on senior unsecured debt to a- from bbb+ with a stable outlook.
•upgraded our long-term issuer credit ratings on subordinated debt to bbb+ from bbb with a stable outlook.
for further information on our ratings and the risks of ratings downgrades, see "item 1 - business - ratings" and "item 1a - risk factors - financial risks - a decline in the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition."
holding company as of december 31, 2023, we had approximately $606.1 million in holding company liquidity, $381.1 million above our targeted minimum level of $225.0 million. the target minimum level of holding company liquidity, which can be used for unforeseen capital needs at our subsidiaries or liquidity needs at the holding company, is calibrated based on approximately one year of pre-tax corporate operating losses and interest expenses. we use the term "holding company liquidity" to represent the portion of cash and other liquid marketable securities held at assurant, inc. (out of a total of $690.0 million as of december 31, 2023) which we are not otherwise holding for a specific purpose as of the balance sheet date. we can use such assets for stock repurchases, stockholder dividends, acquisitions and other corporate purposes.
dividends or returns of capital paid by our subsidiaries, net of infusions of liquid assets and excluding amounts used for or as a result of acquisitions or received from dispositions, were $772.6 million and $549.5 million for twelve months 2023 and twelve months 2022, respectively. we use these cash inflows primarily to pay holding company operating expenses, to make interest payments on indebtedness, to make dividend payments to our common stockholders, to fund investments and acquisitions, and to repurchase our common stock. from time to time, we may also seek to purchase outstanding debt in open market repurchases or privately negotiated transactions.
dividends and repurchases during twelve months 2023 and twelve months 2022, we made common stock repurchases and paid dividends to our common stockholders of $352.3 million and $717.8 million, respectively.
on january 18, 2024, the board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.72 per common share payable on march 25, 2024 to stockholders of record as of february 5, 2024. we paid dividends of $0.72 per common share on december 18, 2023 to stockholders of record as of november 27, 2023. this represented a 3% increase to the quarterly dividend of $0.70 per common share paid on september 18, june 20, and march 20, 2023.
any determination to pay future dividends will be at the discretion of the board and will be dependent upon various factors, including: our subsidiaries' payments of dividends and other statutorily permissible payments to us; our results of operations and cash flows; our financial condition and capital requirements; general business conditions and growth prospects; any legal, tax, regulatory and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends; and any other factors the board deems relevant. the credit facility (as defined below) also contains limitations on our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and repurchase capital stock if we are in default, or such dividend payments or repurchases would cause us to be in default, of our obligations thereunder. in addition, if we elect to defer the payment of interest on our 7.00% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due march 2048 or our 5.25% subordinated notes due january 2061 (refer to "- senior and subordinated notes" below), we generally may not make payments on or repurchase any shares of our capital stock.
during twelve months 2023, we repurchased 1,319,204 shares of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $200.0 million, exclusive of commissions. in may 2021, the board authorized a share repurchase program for up to $900.0 million of our outstanding common stock. in november 2023, the board authorized an additional share repurchase program for up to $600.0 million of our outstanding common stock. as of december 31, 2023, $674.5 million aggregate cost at purchase remained unused under the repurchase authorizations. the timing and the amount of future repurchases will depend on various factors, including those listed above.
assurant subsidiaries the primary sources of funds for our subsidiaries consist of premiums and fees collected, proceeds from the sales and maturity of investments and net investment income. cash is primarily used to pay insurance claims, agent commissions, operating expenses and taxes. we generally invest our subsidiaries' funds in order to generate investment income.
we conduct periodic asset liability studies to measure the duration of our insurance liabilities, to develop optimal asset portfolio maturity structures for our significant lines of business and ultimately to assess that cash flows are sufficient to meet the timing of cash needs. these studies are conducted in accordance with formal company-wide asset liability management guidelines.
to complete a study for a particular line of business, models are developed to project asset and liability cash flows and balance sheet items under a varied set of plausible economic scenarios. these models consider many factors including the current investment portfolio, the required capital for the related assets and liabilities, our tax position and projected cash flows from both existing and projected new business. for risks related to modeling, see "item 1a - risk factors - financial risks -actual results may differ materially from the analytical models we use to assist in our decision-making in key areas such as pricing, catastrophe risks, reserving and capital management."
alternative asset portfolio asset allocations are analyzed for significant lines of business. an investment portfolio maturity structure is then selected from these profiles given our return hurdle and risk appetite. scenario testing of significant liability assumptions and new business projections is also performed.
our liabilities generally do not include policyholder optionality, which means that the timing of payments is generally insensitive to the interest rate environment. in addition, our investment portfolio is largely comprised of highly liquid public fixed maturity securities with a sufficient component of such securities invested that are near maturity which may be sold with minimal risk of loss to meet cash needs.
generally, our subsidiaries' premiums, fees and investment income, along with planned asset sales and maturities, provide sufficient cash to pay claims and expenses. however, there may be instances when unexpected cash needs arise in excess of that available from usual operating sources. in such instances, we have several options to raise needed funds, including selling assets from the subsidiaries' investment portfolios, using holding company cash (if available), issuing commercial paper, or drawing funds from the credit facility.

2026 senior notes: in february 2023, we issued senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $175.0 million, which bear interest at a rate of 6.10% per year, mature in february 2026 and were issued at a 0.035% discount to the public (the "2026 senior notes"). interest on the 2026 senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on february 27 and august 27 of each year, beginning on august 27, 2023. prior to january 27, 2026, we may redeem all or part of the 2026 senior notes at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount of the 2026 senior notes to be redeemed, plus a make-whole premium as described in the 2026 senior notes and accrued and unpaid interest up to the redemption date. on or after that date, we may redeem all or part of the 2026 senior notes at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount of the 2026 senior notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to the redemption date.
in march 2023, we used the net proceeds from the sale of the 2026 senior notes (and available cash on hand) to redeem $175.0 million of the $225.0 million then outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 4.20% senior notes due september 2023 (the "2023 senior notes") plus accrued and unpaid interest up to the redemption date. in connection with the redemption, we recognized a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $0.1 million. the net gain resulted from the recognition of a previously deferred gain from the termination of a hedge of the interest rate risk associated with the redeemed notes, partially offset by the immediate recognition of the remaining deferred debt issuance costs relating to the redeemed notes.
in september 2023, the remaining $50.0 million outstanding principal amount of the 2023 senior notes was paid upon maturity.
in the next five years, we have two debt maturities in february 2026 and march 2028 when the 2026 senior notes and the 2028 senior notes, respectively, become due and payable.
credit facility and commercial paper program we have a $500.0 million five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "credit facility") with a syndicate of banks arranged by jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. and wells fargo bank, national association. the credit facility provides for revolving loans and the issuance of multi-bank, syndicated letters of credit and letters of credit from a sole issuing bank in an aggregate amount of $500.0 million, which may be increased up to $700.0 million. the credit facility is available until december 2026, provided we are in compliance with all covenants. the credit facility has a sublimit for letters of credit issued thereunder of $50.0 million. the proceeds from these loans may be used for our commercial paper program or for general corporate purposes.
we made no borrowings using the credit facility during twelve months 2023 and no loans were outstanding as of december 31, 2023.
our commercial paper program requires us to maintain liquidity facilities either in an available amount equal to any outstanding notes from the program or in an amount sufficient to maintain the ratings assigned to the notes issued from the program. our commercial paper is rated amb-1+ by a.m. best, p-2 by moody's and a-2 by s&p. our subsidiaries do not maintain commercial paper or other borrowing facilities. this program is currently backed up by the credit facility, of which $500.0 million was available as of december 31, 2023.
we did not use the commercial paper program during twelve months 2023 and there were no amounts relating to the commercial paper program outstanding as of december 31, 2023.
for additional information, see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
letters of credit letters of credit are issued in the ordinary course of business. these letters of credit are supported by commitments under which we are required to indemnify the financial institution issuing the letter of credit if the letter of credit is drawn. we had $2.9 million and $2.7 million of letters of credit outstanding as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
cash flows we monitor cash flows at the consolidated, holding company and subsidiary levels. cash flow forecasts at the consolidated and subsidiary levels are provided on a monthly basis, and we use trend and variance analyses to project future cash needs making adjustments to the forecasts when needed.

cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022
operating activities we typically generate operating cash inflows from premiums collected from our insurance products, fees received for services and income received from our investments while outflows consist of policy acquisition costs, benefits paid and operating expenses. these net cash flows are then invested to support the obligations of our insurance products and required capital supporting these products. our cash flows from operating activities are affected by the timing of premiums, fees, and investment income received and expenses paid.
net cash provided by operating activities was $1.14 billion and $596.9 million for twelve months 2023 and twelve months 2022, respectively. the change in net operating cash flows was largely attributable to our mobile business operations, primarily from higher collections of premiums and fees due to timing, and a decrease in payments to vendors for acquisition of mobile devices used to meet insurance claims or generate profits through sales to third parties. the increase was partially offset by higher net paid claims for twelve months 2023 and a receipt of a tax refund that was in excess of tax payments during twelve months 2022.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $637.7 million and $262.1 million for twelve months 2023 and twelve months 2022, respectively. the change in net investing cash flows was primarily driven by the investment of net cash provided by operating activities and reinvestment of proceeds from the sales of maturities of investments in higher yielding fixed maturity securities during the period. also contributing to the change was an increase in purchases of short-term investments due to the timing of working capital needs.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was $403.9 million and $818.4 million for twelve months 2023 and twelve months 2022, respectively. the change in net financing cash flows was primarily due to lower share repurchases during twelve months 2023.

(1)insurance liabilities reflect undiscounted estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders, net of expected future premium cash receipts on in-force policies and excluding fully reinsured runoff operations. the total gross reserve for fully reinsured runoff operations that was excluded was $597.9 million which, if the reinsurers defaulted, would be payable over a 30+ year period with the majority of the payments occurring after 5 years. additional information on the reinsurance arrangements can be found in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. these liabilities also do not include recoverable amounts related to certain high deductible policies in our sharing economy business, included in our non-core operations, for which we are responsible for paying the entirety of the claim and are subsequently reimbursed by the insured for the deductible portion of the claim. as of december 31, 2023, we had exposure to $369.5 million of reserves below the deductible that we would be responsible for if the clients were to default on their contractual obligation to pay us the deductible. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information on our evaluation of the credit risk exposure from these recoverables. as a result, the amounts presented in this table do not agree to the future policy benefits and expenses and claims and benefits payable in the consolidated balance sheets.
(2)our pension obligations and postretirement benefits include an assurant pension plan, various non-qualified pension plans (including an executive pension plan) and certain life and health care benefits for retired employees and their dependents ("retirement health benefits"), all of which were frozen in 2016. in february 2020, we amended the retirement health benefits to terminate such plan benefits to retirees effective december 31, 2024. due to the assurant pension plan's current overfunded status, no contributions were made during 2023 and none are expected to be made in 2024. see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information.
liabilities for future policy benefits and expenses have been included in the commitments and contingencies table. significant uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality, morbidity, expenses, persistency, investment returns, inflation, contract terms and the timing of payments.

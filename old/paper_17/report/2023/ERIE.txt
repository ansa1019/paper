item 1a.     risk factors our business involves various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to those discussed in this section. the risks and uncertainties described in the risk factors below, or any additional risk outside of those discussed below, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, or liquidity if they were to develop into actual events. this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in other reports and materials we file periodically with the securities and exchange commission.
our risks have been divided into the following categories:
risks related to erie insurance exchange - risks related to our dependence on our relationship with the exchange associated with management fees, premium growth, and financial condition, as the exchange is our sole customer and principal source of revenue operating risks - risks stemming from events or circumstances that directly or indirectly affect our operations, including our operations as attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the exchange market, capital, and liquidity risks - risks that may impact the values or results of our investment portfolio, ability to meet financial obligations or covenants, or obtain capital as necessary although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below, risks may have impacts in more than one category and are included where the impact is most significant.
risks related to erie insurance exchange if the management fee rate retained by indemnity is reduced or if there is a significant decrease in the amount of direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange, revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected.
we are dependent upon management fees we retain, which represent our principal source of revenue. in accordance with the subscriber's agreement with the subscribers at the exchange, we may retain up to 25% of all direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange. therefore, management fee revenue from the exchange is calculated by multiplying the management fee rate by the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange. accordingly, any reduction in direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange and/or the management fee rate could have a negative effect on our revenues and net income.
the management fee rate is determined by our board of directors and may not exceed 25% of the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange. the board of directors sets the management fee rate each december for the following year. at their discretion, the rate can be changed at any time. the process of setting the management fee rate includes, but is not limited to, the evaluation of current year operating results compared to both prior year and industry estimated results for both indemnity and the exchange, and consideration of several factors for both entities including, but not limited to: their relative financial strength and capital position; projected revenue, expense and earnings for the subsequent year; future capital needs; as well as competitive position. the evaluation of these factors could result in a reduction to the management fee rate and our revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected.
serving as the attorney-in-fact for subscribers in the reciprocal insurance exchange structure with the exchange being our sole customer, the growth of the exchange could directly affect our operating revenue, which is largely generated from management fees based on the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange. if the exchange's ability to grow or renew policies were adversely impacted, the premium revenue of the exchange could be adversely affected, which could reduce our management fee revenue. the circumstances or events that might impair the exchange's ability to grow include, but are not limited to, the items discussed below.
unfavorable changes in macroeconomic conditions for any reason, including declining consumer confidence, inflation, high unemployment, lower demand for certain services, reduced personal income, and recession, among others, may lead the exchange's customers to modify coverage, not renew policies, or even cancel policies, which could adversely affect the premium revenue of the exchange, and consequently our management fee.
the exchange faces significant competition from other regional and national insurance companies. the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive on the basis of product, price and service. if the exchange's competitors offer property and casualty products with more coverage, offer lower rates, or introduce innovative services in response to evolving customer preferences, and the exchange is unable to implement product or service improvements quickly enough to keep pace, its ability to grow and renew its business may be adversely impacted. in addition, due to the exchange's premium concentration in the automobile and homeowners insurance markets, it may be more sensitive to trends that could affect auto and home insurance coverages and rates over time, for example changing vehicle types or usage, usage-based methods of determining premiums, ownership and driving patterns such as ride sharing or remote work, advancements in vehicle or home technology or safety features such as accident and loss prevention technologies, the development of autonomous vehicles, or residential occupancy patterns, among other factors. innovations, including the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to support underwriting or other decisions, by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry. if the exchange fails to respond to those innovations on a timely basis, its competitive position and results may be materially adversely affected.
the exchange markets and sells its insurance products through independent, non-exclusive insurance agencies. these agencies are not obligated to sell only the exchange's insurance products, and generally also sell products of the exchange's competitors. if agencies do not maintain their current levels of marketing efforts, bind the exchange to unacceptable risks, place business with competing insurers, or if the exchange is unsuccessful in attracting or retaining agencies in its distribution system or maintaining its relationships with those agencies, the exchange's ability to grow and renew its business may be adversely impacted. more broadly, if independent agents face challenges sustaining their own business operations due to unfavorable economic conditions or staffing constraints, it could result in the sale or closure of their businesses, thereby reducing the agency force of the exchange. additionally, shifting consumer behaviors toward increased digital interactions may cause the insurance industry as a whole to migrate to a delivery system other than independent agencies.
the exchange maintains a brand recognized for customer service, which is the result of indemnity's management of the exchange in accordance with the subscriber's agreement. the perceived performance, actions, conduct and behaviors of employees, independent insurance agency representatives, and third-party service providers may result in reputational harm to the exchange's brand. specific incidents which may cause harm include but are not limited to disputes, long customer wait times, errors in processing a claim, failure to protect sensitive customer data, and negative or inaccurate social media or traditional media communications. likewise, an inability to match or exceed the service provided by competitors, who are increasingly relying on digital delivery and enhanced distribution technology, may impede the exchange's ability to maintain and/or grow its customer base. if an extreme catastrophic event were to occur in a heavily concentrated geographic area of subscribers/policyholders, an extraordinarily high number of claims could have the potential to strain claims processing and affect the exchange's ability to service its customers. if third-party service providers fail to perform as anticipated, the exchange may experience operational difficulties, increased costs, and reputational damage. similarly, the exchange's brand could be tarnished by reactions to business practices, adverse financial developments, perceptions of our corporate governance, how we address employee matters and concerns, environmental, social and governance (esg) initiatives, or the conduct of our employees, officers and directors. failure to satisfy expectations in these areas may result in negative publicity or other adverse outcomes, which could be aggravated as the expectations of consumers, regulators and other stakeholders evolve and as social media and other forms of modern communication rapidly magnify reactions. any reputational harm to the exchange could have the potential to impair its ability to grow and renew its business.
as the attorney-in-fact for subscribers in the reciprocal insurance exchange structure with the exchange as our sole customer, we are dependent on the financial condition of the exchange. if the exchange were to fail to maintain acceptable financial strength ratings, its competitive position in the insurance industry could be adversely affected. if a rating downgrade led to customers not renewing or canceling policies, or impacted the exchange's ability to attract new customers, the premium revenue of the exchange could be adversely affected, which could reduce our management fee revenue. the circumstances or events that might impair the exchange's financial condition include, but are not limited to, the items discussed below.
financial strength ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies such as the exchange. higher ratings generally indicate greater financial stability and a stronger ability to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders. the exchange's a.m. best rating is currently a+ ("superior"). a.m. best periodically reviews the exchange's ratings and changes their rating criteria; therefore, the exchange's current rating may not be maintained in the future. a significant downgrade in the a.m. best rating could reduce the competitive position of the exchange, making it more difficult to attract profitable business in the highly competitive property and casualty insurance market and potentially result in reduced sales of its products and lower premium revenue.
the performance of the exchange's investment portfolio is subject to a variety of investment risks. the exchange's investment portfolio is comprised principally of fixed income securities, equity securities and limited partnerships. the fixed income portfolio is subject to a number of risks including, but not limited to, interest rate risk, investment credit risk, sector/concentration risk and liquidity risk. the exchange's common stock and preferred equity securities have exposure to price risk, the risk of potential loss in estimated fair value resulting from an adverse change in prices. limited partnerships are significantly less liquid and generally involve higher degrees of price risk than publicly traded securities. limited partnerships, like publicly traded securities, have exposure to market volatility; but unlike fixed income securities, cash flows and return expectations are less predictable. additionally, a portion of the exchange's common stock and limited partnership portfolios are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk, or the potential loss in estimated fair value resulting from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. if any investments in the exchange's investment portfolio were to suffer a substantial decrease in value, the exchange's financial position could be materially adversely affected through increased unrealized losses or impairments. a significant decrease in the exchange's portfolio could also put it, or its subsidiaries, at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory or rating agency minimum capital requirements.
property and casualty insurers are subject to extensive regulatory supervision in the states in which they do business. this regulatory oversight includes, by way of example, matters relating to licensing, examination, rate setting, market conduct, policy forms, limitations on the nature and amount of certain investments, claims practices, mandated participation in involuntary markets and guaranty funds, reserve adequacy, insurer solvency, restrictions on underwriting standards, accounting standards, transactions between affiliates, risk management, cybersecurity and data privacy, and esg practices. such regulation and supervision are primarily for the benefit and protection of policyholders. changes in applicable insurance laws, tax statutes, cyber, privacy, and other laws and regulations, or changes in the way regulators administer those laws, tax statutes, or regulations could adversely impact the exchange's business, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition, or operating environment and increase its exposure to loss or put it at a competitive disadvantage, which could result in reduced sales of its products and lower premium revenue.
property and casualty insurers face a significant risk of litigation and state and federal regulatory investigations, inquiries and actions in the ordinary course of operating their businesses, including the risk of class action lawsuits. the exchange and its subsidiaries have also been named as defendants in a number of pandemic-related lawsuits and, therefore, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of such litigation. plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against the exchange may seek large or indeterminate amounts of damages, including punitive and treble damages, which may remain unknown for substantial periods of time.
the uncertainty of risks that emerge upon the occurrence of significant unexpected events, such as pandemics, or unexpected economic or social inflation caused by supply chain issues, societal trends, or otherwise, may cause additional challenges in the process of estimating loss and loss adjustment expense reserves or premiums to accommodate future claims and expenses. for example, the behavior of claimants and policyholders and the timing and amounts of claims settlements may change in unexpected ways. furthermore, actions taken by governmental bodies, both legislative and regulatory, in reaction to significant unexpected events, and their related impacts, are hard to predict. technology advancements, such as electric and autonomous vehicles, could impact frequency or severity of losses. the models that are used to determine appropriate premium levels, forecast future losses and expenses, estimate loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, and assess financial strength may be created or deployed in a manner that results in inaccurate predictions. this may result in changes to the exchange's estimated level of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves or impact the adequacy of premiums to accommodate future claims and expenses.
as insurance industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. in some instances, these emerging issues may not become apparent for some time after the exchange has issued the affected insurance policies. as a result, the full extent of liability under the exchange's insurance policies may not be known for many years after the policies are issued. these issues may adversely affect the exchange's business by either extending coverage beyond its underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. if there were legislative action in response to a pandemic or other significant unexpected event that retroactively mandated coverage irrespective of terms, exclusions or other conditions included in policies, such as business interruption, that would otherwise preclude coverage, it could have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the exchange.
the exchange's insurance operations are exposed to claims arising out of catastrophes. common natural catastrophic events include hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, hail storms, and severe winter weather. the frequency and severity of these catastrophes is inherently unpredictable. changing climate conditions have added to the unpredictability of the frequency and severity of natural disasters and have created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. a single catastrophic occurrence or aggregation of multiple smaller occurrences within the geographical region of the exchange or its assumed property reinsurance portfolio could adversely affect the financial condition of the exchange. man-made disasters such as terrorist attacks and riots could also cause losses from insurance claims related to the property and casualty insurance operations, which could adversely affect its financial condition.
operating risks if the costs of providing services to the exchange are not controlled, our profitability could be materially adversely affected.
in accordance with the subscriber's agreement, we perform policy issuance and renewal services for the subscribers at the exchange and we serve as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the subscribers at the exchange with respect to administrative services. the most significant costs we incur in providing policy issuance and renewal services are commissions, employee costs, and technology costs.
commissions to independent agents are our largest expense. commissions include scheduled commissions to agents based upon premiums written as well as incentive compensation, which is earned by achieving certain targeted measures. changes to commission rates or incentive programs may result in increased future costs and lower profitability. our agent incentive compensation includes a profitability component. if claims frequency and loss expenses were to decrease significantly as a result of an unexpected event, such as a pandemic, the profitability component of our agent incentive compensation would improve, and our agent compensation costs would increase. our second largest expense is employee costs, including salaries, healthcare, pension, and other benefit costs. regulatory developments, provider relationships, pandemics and demographic and economic factors that are beyond our control, such as inflation, are indicators that employee costs could increase, which could reduce our profitability. the defined benefit pension plan we offer to our employees is affected by variable factors such as the interest rate used to discount pension liabilities, asset performance, and changes in retirement patterns, which are beyond our control, and any related future cost increases could reduce our profitability.
technological development is necessary to facilitate ease of doing business for employees, agents, and customers. our technological developments are focused on simplifying and improving the employee, agent, and customer experiences, increasing efficiencies, redesigning products, and addressing other potentially disruptive changes in the insurance industry, including the use of artificial intelligence. as we continue to develop technology initiatives in order to remain competitive, our profitability could be negatively impacted as we invest in system development.
if we are unable to attract, develop, and retain talented executives, key managers, and employees our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain talented executives and other key management. talent is defined as people with the right skills, knowledge, abilities, character, and motivation. the loss of the services and leadership of certain key officers and the failure to plan for turnover or retirement or to attract and develop talented new executives and managers could prevent us from successfully communicating, implementing, and executing business strategies.
our success also depends on our ability to attract, develop, and retain a talented employee base. the inability to staff all functions of our business with employees possessing the appropriate talent could have an adverse effect on our business performance. additionally, failure to recognize, evaluate, and respond to changing workforce trends including current labor market conditions and new ways of managing in hybrid work environments, or failure to execute proactive retention and replacement strategies could also have an adverse effect on our business performance. furthermore, failure to instill appropriate cultural expectations and behavioral norms within our employees, particularly in a hybrid work environment, could damage our reputation. staffing appropriately talented employees for the handling of claims and servicing of customers, rendering of disciplined underwriting, and effective sales and marketing are critical to the core functions of our business. in addition, talented employees in the actuarial, finance, human resources, information technology, law, and risk management areas are also essential to support our core functions.
if we are unable to effectively maintain system availability or manage technology initiatives, we may experience adverse financial consequences and/or may be unable to compete effectively.
our business is highly dependent upon the effectiveness of our technology and information systems which support key functions of our core business operations, including processing applications and premium payments, providing customer support, performing actuarial and financial analysis, and maintaining key data. additionally, the exchange relies heavily on technology systems for processing claims. in order to support our business processes and strategic initiatives in a cost and resource efficient manner, we must maintain the effectiveness of existing technology systems and continue to identify and develop new, and enhance existing, technology systems. as we invest in the development of our systems, costs and completion times could exceed original estimates, and/or the project may not deliver the anticipated benefit or perform as expected. if we do not effectively and efficiently manage and upgrade our technology systems, or attract and retain qualified information technology employees and contract personnel to support those systems, our ability to serve our customers and implement our strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted.
additionally, we depend on a large amount of data to price policies appropriately, track exposures, perform financial analysis, report to regulatory bodies, and ultimately make business decisions. should this data be inaccurate or insufficient, risk exposure may be underestimated and/or poor business decisions may be made. this may in turn lead to adverse operational or financial performance and adverse customer or investor confidence.
if we experience difficulties with technology, data and network security, including those that could result from cyber attacks, third-party relationships or cloud-based relationships, our ability to conduct our business could be adversely impacted.
in the normal course of business, we collect, use, store and where appropriate, disclose data concerning individuals and businesses. we also conduct business using third parties who may provide software, data storage, cloud-based computing and other technology services. we have on occasion experienced, and will continue to experience, cyber threats to our data and systems. cyber threats can create significant risks such as destruction of systems or data, denial or interruption of service, disruption of transaction execution, loss or exposure of customer data, theft or exposure of our intellectual property, theft of funds or disruption of other important business functions. even with appropriate governance and controls, the use of artificial intelligence may increase our exposure to cyber threats. our interactions with, and reliance upon, third parties may also expose us to increased risk related to data security, service disruptions or effectiveness of our control system, particularly as we increase our reliance on cloud-based computing and software-as-a-service from third parties to operate our business.
in addition, we are subject to numerous federal and state laws relating to the privacy and security of nonpublic personal information and other sensitive information of our customers, employees and others. the improper access, disclosure, misuse or mishandling of such information could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational damage. third parties on whom we rely for certain business processing functions are also subject to these risks, and their failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could negatively impact us.
the number, complexity, and sophistication of cyber threats continue to increase over time. while we maintain cyber liability insurance to mitigate the financial risk around cyber incidents, such insurance may not cover all costs associated with the consequences of information or systems being compromised, and such insurance may become prohibitively expensive to maintain. additionally, while we have dedicated resources with security incident response capabilities, our response process may not be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not respond quickly enough or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident. similarly, if our third-party service providers experience a cyber incident, they may fail to report, or timely report, the incident to us. as a result, we may suffer significant legal, reputational, or financial losses, which could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.
if events occurred causing interruption of our operations, facilities, systems or business functions, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.
we have established business continuity and disaster recovery plans to provide for the continuation of core business operations in the event that normal business operations could not be performed due to catastrophic or other events, including pandemics. while we continue to test and assess our business continuity and disaster recovery plans to validate they meet the needs of our core business operations and address multiple business interruption events, there is no assurance that core business operations could be performed upon the occurrence of such an event. employee absence, physical premises damage, systems failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform our business functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our business and customer relationships. our operational resiliency is also dependent on third-party personnel, infrastructure and systems on which we rely, including cloud-based technologies and software-as-a-service applications. our operations and those of our third parties may become vulnerable to damage or disruption due to circumstances beyond our or their control, such as from catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, pandemics, supply chain interruptions, network failures, and cyber attacks. additionally, we are dependent on internet and telecommunications access and capabilities. our workforce is largely concentrated in erie, pennsylvania. if a significant event affects the labor force in this area, it could impact the policy acquisition, underwriting, claims and/or support services provided to the policyholders and/or independent agents of the exchange. disruptions to our workforce or our operations for any reason could result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition, or results of operations.
we are subject to applicable insurance laws, tax statutes, and numerous other federal and state laws and regulations, as well as claims and legal proceedings, which, if determined unfavorably, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
our activities are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws on matters as diverse as internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls, securities regulation, data privacy and protection, cybersecurity, taxation, immigration, wage-and-hour standards and employment and labor relations. these laws and regulations are complex and evolving, and compliance with these laws requires significant resources. in some cases, these laws and regulations may increase our costs, negatively impact revenues, or impose operational limitations on our business. further, there can be no assurance that we, our third-party service providers and our independent agents are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations at all times. efforts at compliance with all laws and regulations are further complicated by new and evolving regulations regarding cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and esg matters.
we face a significant risk of litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating our businesses including the risk of class action lawsuits. we are, have been, or may become subject to class actions and individual suits alleging breach of fiduciary or other duties, including our obligations to indemnify directors and officers in connection with certain legal matters. we are also subject to litigation arising out of our general business activities such as contractual and employment relationships and claims regarding the infringement of the intellectual property of others. plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may seek large or indeterminate amounts of damages, including punitive and treble damages, which may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. we are also subject to various regulatory inquiries, such as information requests, subpoenas, and books and record examinations from state and federal regulators and authorities. in addition, changes in the way regulators administer applicable laws, tax statutes, or regulations could adversely impact our business, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition. it is also possible that changes in economic conditions and steps taken by federal, state, and local governments in response to a pandemic or other significant events could cause an increase in taxes at the federal, state, and local levels, which could adversely impact our results of operations.
market, capital, and liquidity risks the performance of our investment portfolio is subject to a variety of investment risks, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
at december 31, 2023, our investment portfolio consisted of approximately 85% fixed maturity securities, with the remaining 15% invested in equity securities and other investments.
general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments and the realization of net investment income or result in realized investment losses. in addition, downward economic trends also may have an adverse effect on our investment results by negatively impacting the business conditions and impairing credit for the issuers of securities held in our respective investment portfolios. this could reduce fair values of investments and generate significant unrealized losses or impairment charges which may adversely affect our financial results.
the performance of the fixed income portfolio is subject to a number of risks including, but not limited to:
•interest rate risk - the risk of adverse changes in the value of fixed income securities as a result of increases in market interest rates.
•investment credit risk - the risk that the value of certain investments may decrease due to the deterioration in financial condition of, or the liquidity available to, one or more issuers of those securities or, in the case of structured securities, due to the deterioration of the loans or other assets that underlie the securities, which, in each case, also includes the risk of permanent loss.
•sector/concentration risk - the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors, or industries. events or developments that have a negative impact on any particular industry, group of related industries, or geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on our investment portfolio to the extent that the portfolio is concentrated within those issuers, sectors, or industries.
•liquidity risk - the risk that we will not be able to convert investment securities into cash on favorable terms and on a timely basis, or that we will not be able to sell them at all, when desired. disruptions in the financial markets or a lack of buyers for the specific securities that we are trying to sell could prevent us from liquidating securities or cause a reduction in prices to levels that are not acceptable to us.
•reinvestment risk - the possibility that the cash flows produced by an investment will have to be reinvested at a reduced rate of return. approximately 36% of our fixed maturity portfolio is expected to mature over the next three years.
our equity securities have exposure to price risk. equity markets, sectors, industries, and individual securities may also be subject to some of the same risks that affect our fixed income portfolio, as discussed above.
all of our fixed income and equity securities are subject to market volatility. to the extent that future market volatility negatively impacts our investments, our financial condition will be negatively impacted. we review the fixed income portfolio on a periodic basis to evaluate positions that are in an unrealized loss position to determine whether impairments are a result of credit loss or other factors. inherent in management's evaluation of a security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. as the process for determining impairments is highly subjective, changes in our assessments may have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition. see also part ii, item 7a. "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk".
deteriorating capital and credit market conditions or a failure to accurately estimate capital needs may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs and access capital.
sufficient liquidity and capital levels are required to pay operating expenses, income taxes, and to provide the necessary resources to fund future growth opportunities, satisfy certain financial covenants, pay dividends on common stock, and repurchase common stock. management estimates the appropriate level of capital necessary based upon current and projected results, which includes evaluating potential risks. failure to accurately estimate our capital needs may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition until additional sources of capital can be obtained. further, a deteriorating financial condition may create a negative perception of us by third parties, including investors, and financial institutions, which could impact our ability to access capital in the debt or equity markets. volatility in the financial markets could also limit our ability to sell certain fixed income securities or cause such investments to sell at deep discounts.
our primary sources of liquidity are management fee revenue and cash flows generated from our investment portfolio. in the event these traditional sources of liquidity are not available, we may have to seek additional financing. our access to funds will depend upon a number of factors including current market conditions, the availability of credit, market liquidity, and the timing of obtaining credit ratings. in deteriorating market conditions, there can be no assurance that we will obtain additional financing, or, if available, that the cost of financing will not substantially increase and affect our overall profitability.
item 7.     management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations highlights significant factors influencing erie indemnity company ("indemnity", "we", "us", "our"). this discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes and all other items contained within this annual report on form 10-k as these contain important information helpful in evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.

recent accounting standards see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 2, significant accounting policies, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards and the impact on our financial statements if known.
operating overview overview we are a pennsylvania business corporation that since 1925 has been the managing attorney-in-fact for the subscribers (policyholders) at the exchange, a reciprocal insurer that writes property and casualty insurance. our primary function as attorney-in-fact is to perform policy issuance and renewal services on behalf of the subscribers at the exchange. we also act as attorney-in-fact on behalf of the subscribers at the exchange, as well as the service provider for the exchange's insurance subsidiaries, with respect to all administrative services.
the exchange is a reciprocal insurance exchange, which is an unincorporated association of individuals, partnerships and corporations that agree to insure one another. each applicant for insurance (a subscriber) to the exchange signs a subscriber's agreement, which contains an appointment of indemnity as their attorney-in-fact to transact the business of the exchange on their behalf.
in accordance with the subscriber's agreement for acting as attorney-in-fact in these two capacities, we retain a management fee. management fee revenue is based upon all direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange and the management fee rate, which is not to exceed 25%. our board of directors establishes the management fee rate at least annually, generally in december for the following year.  the process of setting the management fee rate includes, but is not limited to, the evaluation of current year operating results compared to both prior year and industry estimated results for both indemnity and the exchange, and consideration of several factors for both entities including, but not limited to: their relative financial strength and capital position; projected revenue, expense and earnings for the subsequent year; future capital needs; as well as competitive position. the management fee rate was set at 25% for 2023, 2022 and 2021.  based on analysis of the foregoing factors, our board of directors set the 2024 management fee rate again at 25%.
our earnings are primarily driven by the management fee revenue generated for the services we provide on behalf of the subscribers at the exchange.  the policy issuance and renewal services we provide are related to the sales, underwriting and issuance of policies. the sales related services we provide include agent compensation and certain sales and advertising support services. agent compensation includes scheduled commissions to agents based upon premiums written as well as incentive compensation, which is earned by achieving targeted measures. agent compensation comprised approximately 67% of our 2023 policy issuance and renewal expenses. the underwriting services we provide include underwriting and policy processing and comprised approximately 9% of our 2023 policy issuance and renewal expenses. the remaining services we provide include customer service and administrative support. we also provide information technology services that support all the functions listed above that comprised approximately 11% of our 2023 policy issuance and renewal expenses. included in these expenses are allocations of costs for departments that support these policy issuance and renewal functions.
consistent with its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the exchange does not have any employees or officers. therefore, it enters into contractual relationships by and through the subscribers' attorney-in-fact. indemnity serves as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the subscribers at the exchange with respect to its administrative services as enumerated in the subscriber's agreement. the exchange's insurance subsidiaries also utilize indemnity for these services in accordance with the service agreements between each of the subsidiaries and indemnity. claims handling services include costs incurred in the claims process, including the adjustment, investigation, defense, recording and payment functions. life insurance management services include costs incurred in the management and processing of life insurance business. investment management services are related to investment trading activity, accounting and all other functions attributable to the investment of funds. in 2023, approximately 71% of the administrative services expenses were entirely attributable to the respective administrative functions (claims handling, life insurance management and investment management), while the remaining 29% of these expenses were allocations of costs for departments that support these administrative functions. the expenses we incur and related reimbursements we receive for administrative services are presented gross in our statements of operations. the subscriber's agreement and service agreements provide for reimbursement of amounts incurred for these services to indemnity. reimbursements are settled at cost on a monthly basis. state insurance regulations require that intercompany service agreements and any material amendments be approved in advance by the state insurance department.
our results of operations are tied to the growth and financial condition of the exchange as the exchange is our sole customer, and our earnings are largely generated from management fees based on the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange. the exchange generates revenue by insuring preferred and standard risks, with personal lines comprising 70% of the 2023 direct and affiliated assumed written premiums and commercial lines comprising the remaining 30%.  the principal personal lines products are private passenger automobile and homeowners.  the principal commercial lines products are commercial multi-peril, commercial automobile and workers compensation.
we generate investment income from our fixed maturity and equity security portfolios. our portfolio is managed with the objective of maximizing after-tax returns on a risk-adjusted basis. we actively evaluate the fixed maturity portfolios for securities in an unrealized loss position and record impairment write-downs on investments in instances where we have the intent to sell or it's more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security. impairments resulting from a credit loss are recognized in earnings with a corresponding allowance on the statement of financial position.

nm = not meaningful operating income increased in 2023 compared to 2022 as growth in operating revenue outpaced the growth in operating expenses. management fee revenue is based upon the management fee rate we charge and the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange.  the management fee rate was 25% for 2023, 2022, and 2021.  the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange increased 17.0% to $10.1 billion in 2023 and 9.2% to $8.6 billion in 2022.
cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services increased 12.0% to $2.0 billion in 2023 primarily due to higher scheduled commissions driven by direct and affiliated assumed written premium growth, as well as increased employee compensation and technology costs. cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services increased 7.0% to $1.8 billion in 2022 primarily due to higher scheduled commissions driven by direct and affiliated assumed written premium growth, as well as increased professional fees and technology costs. increases in the cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services in both periods were partially offset by decreased agent incentive compensation driven by higher claims severity and related loss costs experienced by the exchange.
management fee revenue for administrative services increased 9.2% to $63.7 million in 2023 compared to an increase of 0.1% in 2022. the administrative services reimbursement revenue and corresponding cost of operations increased both total operating revenue and total operating expenses by $737.1 million in 2023 and $668.3 million in 2022, but had no net impact on operating income.
total investment income increased $28.3 million in 2023 primarily due to lower net realized and unrealized investment losses and an increase in net investment income compared to 2022. total investment income decreased $66.7 million in 2022
primarily due to a decrease in net investment income as well as net realized and unrealized investment losses in 2022 compared to net gains in 2021.
general conditions and trends affecting our business economic conditions unfavorable changes in economic conditions, including declining consumer confidence, inflation, high unemployment, and the threat of recession, among others, may lead the exchange's customers to modify coverage, not renew policies, or even cancel policies, which could adversely affect the premium revenue of the exchange, and consequently our management fee revenue.  inflation remained elevated from historical levels during 2023. continued elevated inflation or supply chain disruptions could impact the exchange's operations and our management fees. in particular, unanticipated increased inflation costs including medical cost inflation, building material cost inflation, auto repair and replacement cost inflation, and social inflation may impact adequacy of estimated loss reserves and future premium rates of the exchange. the extent and duration of the impacts to economic conditions remain uncertain. if any of these items impacted the financial condition or operations of the exchange, it could have an impact on our financial results. see financial condition, liquidity and capital resources, and part i, item 1a. "risk factors" contained within this report for a discussion of potential impacts to our operations or those of the exchange.
financial market volatility our portfolio of fixed maturity and equity security investments is subject to market volatility especially in periods of instability in the worldwide financial markets. over time, net investment income could also be impacted by volatility and by the general level of interest rates, which impact reinvested cash flow from the portfolio and business operations. depending upon market conditions, considerable fluctuation could occur in the fair value of our investment portfolio and reported total investment income, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. various ongoing geopolitical events, the uncertain inflationary and interest rate environments, and a potential economic slowdown could have a significant impact on the global financial markets with the potential for future losses and/or impairments on our investment portfolio.
critical accounting estimates the financial statements include amounts based upon estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures. we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 1) it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, and 2) different estimates that could have been used, or changes in the estimate that are likely to occur from period-to-period, could have a material impact on our statements of operations or financial position.
the following presents a discussion of those accounting policies surrounding estimates that we believe are the most critical to our reported amounts and require the most subjective and complex judgment. if actual events differ significantly from the underlying assumptions, there could be material adjustments to prior estimates that could potentially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. the estimates and the estimating methods used are reviewed continually, and any adjustments considered necessary are reflected in current earnings.
investment valuation fair value measurements we make estimates concerning the fair value of our investments using valuation techniques to derive the fair value of the fixed maturity and equity investments we hold. fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between willing market participants at the measurement date.
fair value measurements are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information. we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. our investments are categorized into a three-level fair value hierarchy which assigns a level 1 for highly observable inputs and a level 3 to unobservable inputs. we continually assess whether or not an active market exists for all of our investments and as of each reporting date we re-evaluate their classification in the fair value hierarchy.
as of each reporting period, financial instruments recorded at fair value are classified based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. the presence of at least one unobservable input that has significant impact to the fair value measurement would result in classification as a level 3 instrument. our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset, such as the relative impact on the fair value as a result of including a particular input and market conditions. while estimates of the fair values of our investment portfolio are obtained from outside pricing services, we ultimately determine whether the inputs used are observable or unobservable.
as of december 31, 2023, substantially all of the securities measured at fair value in our investment portfolio are classified as level 2. level 2 securities are valued using industry-standard models that consider various inputs, such as the interest rate and credit spread for the underlying financial instruments. all significant inputs are observable, or derived from observable information in the marketplace, or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. at december 31, 2023, our investments classified as level 3 were not significant.
see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 5, fair value, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report for additional details on the fair value measurement of our investments.
impairments our fixed maturity portfolio experienced unrealized losses in 2023 and 2022 as a result of the higher interest rate environment compared to prior years. we regularly monitor our fixed maturity and equity security portfolios for price changes and perform detailed reviews of securities in an unrealized loss position that may indicate that credit-related or other impairments exist. as of december 31, 2023, our intent to sell and credit-related impairments were not material to our financial condition or results of operations.
see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 2, significant accounting policies, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report for additional details on impairments.
retirement benefit plans for employees our pension plans consist of a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees and an unfunded supplemental employee retirement plan ("serp") for certain members of executive and senior management. although we are the sponsor of these postretirement plans and record the funded status of these plans, there are reimbursements between us and the exchange and its subsidiaries for their allocated share of pension income or cost. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 9, postretirement benefits, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report for additional details on these reimbursements.
our pension obligation is developed from actuarial estimates.  several statistical and other factors, which attempt to anticipate future events, are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans.  key factors include assumptions about the discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets.  we review these assumptions annually and modify them considering historical experience, current market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates, and expected future trends.
accumulated and projected benefit obligations are expressed as the present value of future cash payments.  we discount those cash payments based upon a yield curve developed from corporate bond yield information with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits.  lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense, while higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense.  the construction of the yield curve is based upon yields of corporate bonds rated aa or equivalent quality.  target yields are developed from bonds at various maturity points and a curve is fitted to those targets.  spot rates (zero coupon bond yields) are developed from the yield curve and used to discount benefit payment amounts associated with each future year.  the present value of plan benefits is calculated by applying the spot/discount rates to projected benefit cash flows.  a single discount rate is then developed to produce the same present value. the cash flows from the yield curve were matched against our projected benefit payments in the pension plan, which have a duration of about 15 years.  this yield curve supported the selection of a 5.34% discount rate for the projected benefit obligation at december 31, 2023 and for the 2024 pension income.  the same methodology was used to develop the 5.67% and 3.16% discount rates used to determine the projected benefit obligation for 2022 and 2021, respectively, and the pension income for 2023 and expense for 2022, respectively. a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would increase pension cost in the following year by $4.1 million, of which our share would be approximately $1.6 million, and would increase the pension benefit obligation by $37.2 million.
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors, including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on plan assets.  these unrecognized gains and losses are recorded in the pension plan obligation and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). these amounts are systematically recognized to net periodic pension expense in future periods, with gains decreasing and losses increasing future pension expense. if actuarial net gains or losses exceed 5% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation and the market-
related value of plan assets, the excess is recognized through the net periodic pension expense equally over the estimated service period of the employee group, which is currently 14 years.
the expected long-term rate of return for the pension plan represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid.  to determine the expected long-term rate of return assumption, we utilized models based upon rigorous historical analysis and forward-looking views of the financial markets based upon key factors such as historical returns for the asset class' applicable indices, the correlations of the asset classes under various market conditions and consensus views on future real economic growth and inflation.  the expected future return for each asset class is then combined by considering correlations between asset classes and the volatilities of each asset class to produce a reasonable range of asset return results within which our expected long-term rate of return assumption falls. while the expected long-term rate of return is generally less susceptible to annual revisions as there are typically no significant changes in the asset mix, we increased the expected return on asset assumption from 6.50% to 7.00% in 2024 based on the current asset allocation and considering a review of the key factors and expectations of future performance as well as the current market environment. a change of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $2.9 million impact on net pension benefit cost in the following year, of which our share would be approximately $1.2 million.
we use a four-year averaging method to determine the market-related value of plan assets, which is used to determine the expected return component of pension expense.  under this methodology, asset gains or losses that result from returns that differ from our long-term rate of return assumption are recognized in the market-related value of assets on a level basis over a four-year period.  the market-related asset experience during 2023 that related to the actual investment return being different from that assumed during the prior year was a gain of $36.8 million. recognition of this gain will be deferred and recognized over a four-year period, consistent with the market-related asset value methodology. once factored into the market-related asset value, these experience gains and losses will be amortized over a period of 14 years, which is the remaining service period of the employee group.
in 2023, we recognized net pension benefit income of $3.8 million primarily driven by higher discount rates and expected return on assets, partially offset by lower than expected returns during 2022. we continue to project net pension benefit income in 2024 as opposed to expense. while our discount rate assumptions decreased for 2024, the estimated increase in net pension benefit income to $4.3 million in 2024 is primarily due to an anticipated one-time serp settlement credit of $1.0 million. our share of the net pension benefit income after reimbursements was $0.9 million in 2023. we expect our share of the net pension benefit income to be approximately $1.4 million in 2024, of which expense of $13.0 million will be recorded in operating expense and income of $14.4 million will be recorded in other income.
the actuarial assumptions we used in determining our pension obligation may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, or longer or shorter life spans of participants.  while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 9, postretirement benefits, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report for additional details on the pension plans.
results of operations management fee revenue we have two performance obligations in the subscriber's agreement, providing policy issuance and renewal services and acting as attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the exchange, as well as the service provider for the exchange's insurance subsidiaries, with respect to all administrative services. we retain management fees for acting as the attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the exchange in these two capacities and allocate our revenues between our performance obligations.
the management fee is calculated by multiplying all direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange by the management fee rate, which is determined by our board of directors at least annually.  the management fee rate was set at 25% for 2023, 2022 and 2021.  changes in the management fee rate can affect our revenue and net income significantly. the transaction price, including management fee revenue and administrative services reimbursement revenue, includes variable consideration and is allocated based on the estimated standalone selling prices developed using industry information and other available information for similar services. we update the transaction price and the related allocation at least annually based upon the most recent information available or more frequently if there have been significant changes in any components considered in the transaction price.
the following table presents the allocation and disaggregation of revenue for our two performance obligations:

(1)    a constraining estimate of variable consideration exists related to the potential for management fees to be returned if a policy were to be cancelled mid-term. management fees are returned to the exchange when policies are cancelled mid-term and unearned premiums are refunded.
(2)    management fee revenue - administrative services is recognized over time as the services are provided. see item 8. "financial statements - note 3, revenue, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report.
direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange direct and affiliated assumed premiums include premiums written directly by the exchange and premiums assumed from its wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries. direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange increased 17.0% to $10.1 billion in 2023, from $8.6 billion in 2022, primarily driven by increased personal lines and commercial multi-peril premiums written.  year-over-year policies in force for all lines of business increased 6.9% in 2023 as the result of continuing strong policyholder retention and an increase in new policies written, compared to 3.6% in 2022.  the year-over-year average premium per policy for all lines of business increased 9.4% at december 31, 2023, compared to 5.4% at december 31, 2022.
premiums generated from new business increased 37.9% to $1.5 billion in 2023. contributing to this change was a 23.7% increase in new business policies written and a 11.5% increase in year-over-year average premium per policy on new business at december 31, 2023. premiums generated from new business increased 14.5% to $1.1 billion in 2022. year-over-year average premium per policy on new business increased 10.4% at december 31, 2022 and new business policies written increased 3.7% in 2022.
premiums generated from renewal business increased 13.9% to $8.5 billion in 2023, and increased 8.5% to $7.5 billion, in 2022.  underlying the trend in renewal business premiums in both periods were increases in year-over-year average premium per policy of 9.0% at december 31, 2023 and 4.7% at december 31, 2022, as well as an increase in year-over-year policies in force of 4.5% and 3.6% in 2023 and 2022, respectively, driven by a slight increase in policy retention ratios.
the exchange implements rate changes in order to meet loss cost expectations. in response to reduced driving conditions in 2020 resulting from the covid-19 pandemic, the exchange implemented $200 million in personal and commercial auto rate reductions on policies written between july 1, 2020 and june 30, 2021, which negatively impacted exchange's written premium in 2021 by approximately $110 million. the exchange began implementing rate increases in 2021 primarily due to increased claims frequency as driving activity returned to near pre-pandemic levels and continued to implement rate increases in 2022 and 2023 primarily as a result of inflation-driven severity increases.
as the exchange writes policies with annual terms only, rate actions take 12 months to be fully recognized in written premium and 24 months to be recognized in earned premiums. since rate changes are realized at renewal, it takes 12 months to implement a rate change to all policyholders and another 12 months to earn the increased or decreased premiums in full. as a result, certain rate changes approved in 2022 were reflected in 2023, and a portion of the rate actions approved in 2023 will be reflected in 2024. furthermore, the exchange writes certain personal auto policies with a rate locking feature, which generally extends the amount of time it takes for rate actions to be recognized. the exchange continuously evaluates pricing and product offerings to meet consumer demands.
personal lines - total personal lines premiums written increased 18.7% to $7.1 billion in 2023, from $6.0 billion in 2022, driven by a 10.5% increase in total personal lines year-over-year average premium per policy and a 7.4% increase in total personal lines policies in force. total personal lines year-over-year average premium per policy increased 4.4% at december 31, 2022 and policies in force increased 3.9% in 2022.
commercial lines - total commercial lines premiums written increased 13.0% to $3.0 billion in 2023, compared to 2022, driven by a 9.5% increase in the total commercial lines year-over-year average premium per policy and a 3.2% increase in total commercial lines policies in force. total commercial lines premiums written increased 11.2% in 2022, compared to 2021, driven by a 9.0% increase in the total commercial lines year-over-year average premium per policy and a 2.0% increase in total commercial lines policies in force.
future trends-premium revenue - through a careful agency selection and monitoring process, the exchange plans to continue efforts to utilize its agency force to increase market penetration in existing operating territories to contribute to future growth.
changes in premium levels attributable to the growth in policies in force directly affect the profitability of the exchange and have a direct bearing on our management fee. our continued focus on underwriting discipline and the maturing of pricing sophistication models have contributed to the exchange's steady policy retention ratios. the continued growth of its policy base is dependent upon the exchange's ability to retain existing and attract new subscribers/policyholders. a lack of new policy growth or the inability to retain existing customers could have an adverse effect on the exchange's premium level growth, and consequently our management fee.
changes in premium levels attributable to rate changes also directly affect the profitability of the exchange and have a direct bearing on our management fee. pricing actions contemplated or taken by the exchange are subject to various regulatory requirements of the states in which it operates. the pricing actions already implemented, or to be implemented, have an effect on the market competitiveness of the exchange's insurance products. such pricing actions, and those of the exchange's competitors, could affect the ability of the exchange's agents to retain and attract new business. we expect the exchange's pricing actions in 2023 to result in an increase in direct written premiums in 2024; however, exposure reductions and/or changes in mix of business as a result of economic conditions could impact the average direct and affiliated assumed premium written by the exchange, as customers may reduce coverages.

policy issuance and renewal services the management fee revenue allocated for providing policy issuance and renewal services was 24.30% of the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange for 2023, 2022, and 2021. this portion of the management fee is recognized as revenue when the policy is issued or renewed because it is at that time that the services we provide are substantially complete and the executed insurance policy is transferred to the customer. the increase in management fee revenue for policy issuance and renewal services was driven by the increase in the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange discussed previously.
service agreement revenue service agreement revenue primarily consists of service charges we collect from subscribers/policyholders for providing multiple payment plans on policies written by the exchange and its property and casualty subsidiaries and also includes late payment and policy reinstatement fees.  the service charges are fixed dollar amounts per billed installment. service agreement revenue also includes fees received from the exchange for the use of shared office space. the increase in service agreement revenue in 2023 and 2022 is primarily due to an increase in shared office space revenue.

commissions - commissions increased $169.0 million in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by the growth in direct and affiliated assumed written premium, partially offset by a decrease in agent incentive compensation. the profitability component of agent incentive compensation decreased due to higher claims severity and related loss costs in the three-year period ended 2023 compared to the three-year period ended 2022. commissions increased $71.1 million in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily driven by the growth in direct and affiliated assumed written premium, partially offset by a decrease in agent incentive compensation. the profitability component of agent incentive compensation decreased due to higher claims severity and related loss costs experienced primarily in 2022.
non-commission expense - non-commission expense increased $46.9 million in 2023 compared to 2022. underwriting and policy processing costs increased $9.4 million primarily due to policies in force growth. information technology costs increased $18.6 million primarily due to increased professional fees, personnel costs, and hardware and software costs. administrative and other expenses increased $20.0 million primarily due to an increase in personnel costs. personnel costs in 2023 were impacted by increased compensation including higher estimated costs for incentive plan awards, partially offset by lower pension costs due to an increase in the discount rate compared to 2022. increases in incentive plan costs were driven by improved direct written premium and policies in force growth and indemnity's higher stock price at year-end 2023 compared to 2022.
in 2022, non-commission expense increased $47.1 million compared to 2021. underwriting and policy processing costs increased $6.4 million primarily due to increased underwriting report, printing, and personnel costs. information technology costs increased $13.1 million primarily due to increased hardware and software costs and professional fees, partially offset by decreased personnel costs. sales and advertising costs increased $7.5 million primarily due to increased advertising and agent-related expenses. administrative and other expenses increased $22.5 million primarily due to an increase in personnel costs related to compensation and increased professional fees.

net realized and unrealized losses of $5.8 million in 2023 were primarily due to disposals of available-for-sale and equity securities, partially offset by market value adjustment gains on equity securities. net realized and unrealized losses of $27.3 million in 2022 were primarily due to disposals of available-for-sale securities and market value adjustments on equity securities, while gains of $4.9 million in 2021 were primarily due to disposals of available-for-sale securities.
net impairment (losses) recoveries recognized in earnings net impairment losses of $9.8 million in 2023 include $7.3 million of current expected credit losses recognized on loans receivable related to real estate development projects supporting the revitalization efforts in our community. see "other assets" in item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 2, significant accounting policies, of notes to financial statements" for additional information. impairment losses in 2023 also include $2.4 million related to available-for-sale securities, including $1.8 million of securities in an unrealized loss position where we had intent to sell prior to recovery of our amortized cost basis and $0.7 million of credit impairment losses. net impairment losses of $0.7 million in 2022 were related to available-for-sale securities and include $0.5 million of credit impairment losses and $0.2 million of securities in an unrealized loss position where we had intent to sell prior to recovery of our amortized cost basis. net impairment recoveries of $0.2 million in 2021 were primarily the result of a change in the current expected credit loss allowance related to our agent loans.
financial condition of erie insurance exchange serving in the capacity of attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the exchange, we are dependent on the growth and financial condition of the exchange, who is our sole customer. the strength of the exchange and its wholly owned subsidiaries is rated annually by a.m. best through assessing its financial stability and ability to pay claims. the ratings are generally based upon factors relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward return to investors. the exchange and each of its property and casualty subsidiaries are rated a+ "superior", the second highest financial strength rating, which is assigned to companies that have achieved superior overall performance when compared to the standards established by a.m. best and have a superior ability to meet obligations to policyholders over the long term. on august 10, 2023, the outlook for the financial strength rating was affirmed as stable. as of december 31, 2023, only approximately 12% of insurance groups, in which the exchange is included, are rated a+ or higher.
the financial statements of the exchange are prepared in accordance with statutory accounting principles prescribed by the commonwealth of pennsylvania. financial statements prepared under statutory accounting principles focus on the solvency of the insurer and generally provide a more conservative approach than under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. statutory direct written premiums of the exchange and its wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries grew 17.0% to $10.1 billion in 2023 from $8.6 billion in 2022. these premiums, along with investment income, are the major sources of cash that support the operations of the exchange. policyholders' surplus, determined under statutory accounting principles, was $9.3 billion and $10.1 billion at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the exchange and its wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries' year-over-year policy retention ratio continues to be high at 91.2% at december 31, 2023 and 90.5% at december 31, 2022.
we have prepared our financial statements considering the financial strength of the exchange based on its a.m. best rating and strong level of surplus. see part i, item 1a. "risk factors" for possible outcomes that could impact that determination.

we continually review our investment portfolio for impairment and determine whether the impairment is a result of credit loss or other factors. we analyze all positions with an emphasis on those in a significant unrealized loss position. if we have the intent to sell or it's more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis, the entire impairment is recognized in earnings. factors considered in the evaluation of credit loss include the extent to which fair value is less than cost and fundamental factors specific to the issuer such as financial condition, changes in credit ratings, near and long-term business prospects and other factors, as well as the likelihood of recovery of the amortized cost of the security. impairment resulting from credit loss is recognized in earnings with a corresponding allowance on the statement of financial position. we believe our investment valuation philosophy and accounting practices result in appropriate and timely measurement of fair value and recognition of impairment.
fixed maturities under our investment strategy, we maintain a fixed maturity portfolio that is of high quality and well diversified within each market sector. this investment strategy also achieves a balanced maturity schedule. our fixed maturity portfolio is managed with the goal of achieving reasonable returns while limiting exposure to risk.
fixed maturities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, included in shareholders' equity. net unrealized losses on fixed maturities, net of deferred taxes, totaled $24.7 million at december 31, 2023, compared to $52.5 million at december 31, 2022. our evaluation of deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance included available tax planning strategies that could be implemented, if necessary, to support the realizability of deferred tax assets. we believe those tax strategies are feasible and prudent.

shareholders' equity postretirement benefit plans the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans is recognized in the statements of financial position, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. at december 31, 2023, shareholders' equity amounts related to these postretirement plans decreased by $33.8 million, net of tax, of which $11.0 million represents amortization of the prior service cost and net actuarial gain and $22.8 million represents the current period actuarial loss.  the 2023 actuarial loss was driven primarily by the lower discount rate used to measure the future benefit obligations, partially offset by higher than expected return on plan assets. at december 31, 2022, shareholders' equity amounts related to these postretirement plans increased by $76.5 million, net of tax, of which $6.9 million represents amortization of the prior service cost and net actuarial loss and $69.6 million represents the current period actuarial gain.  the 2022 actuarial gain was driven by the higher discount rate, offset by lower than expected return on plan assets. although we are the sponsor of these postretirement plans and record the funded status of these plans, there are reimbursements between us and the exchange and its subsidiaries for their allocated share of pension income or cost. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 9, postretirement benefits, of notes to financial statements" contained within this report for additional details on these reimbursements.
liquidity and capital resources we continue to monitor the sufficiency of our liquidity and capital resources given the potential impact of current economic conditions, including the uncertain inflationary and interest rate environment. while we did not see a significant impact on our sources or uses of cash in 2023, future disruptions in the markets could occur which may affect our liquidity position. if our normal operating and investing cash activities were to become insufficient to meet future funding requirements, we believe we have sufficient access to liquidity through our cash position, diverse liquid marketable securities, and our $100 million bank revolving line of credit that does not expire until october 2026. see broader discussions of potential risks to our operations in part i, item 1a. "risk factors" contained within this report.
sources and uses of cash liquidity is a measure of a company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short- and long-term cash requirements of its business operations and growth needs.  our liquidity requirements have been met primarily by funds generated from management fee revenue and income from investments.  cash provided from these sources is used primarily to fund the costs of our management operations including commissions, salaries and wages, pension plans, share repurchases, dividends to shareholders, the purchase and development of information technology, and other capital expenditures.  we expect that our operating cash needs will be met by funds generated from operations. cash in excess of our operating needs is primarily invested in investment grade fixed maturities. as part of our liquidity review, we regularly evaluate our capital needs based on current and projected results and consider the potential impacts to our liquidity, borrowing capacity, financial covenants and capital availability.
we have certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under various agreements. cash requirements within the next twelve months include accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and other current obligations.
our long-term cash requirements under various contractual obligations and commitments include:
•pension - we have a funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees and an unfunded serp for certain members of executive and senior management. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 9, postretirement benefits, of notes to financial statements" for the funding policy and related contributions for our defined benefit pension plan, and accumulated benefit obligation for our unfunded serp.
•deferred compensation - we have two deferred compensation plans for our executives, senior vice presidents, and other selected officers and two deferred compensation plans for our outside directors. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 10, incentive and deferred compensation plans, of notes to financial statements" for additional details of these obligations and estimated future payments.
•home office renovations - we have an agreement with an external contracting firm for renovations to an office building that is part of our principal headquarters. remaining commitments related to the underlying contracts due in the next 12 months totaled $30.8 million at december 31, 2023. additional contracts will be executed as we begin each new phase of the overall renovation project and will be funded using our working capital. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 7, fixed assets, of notes to financial statements" for additional details on construction in progress costs and expected completion date.
•other commitments - we have commitments for approximately $531 million which include agreements for various services, including information technology, support and maintenance obligations, operating leases for equipment, vehicles and real estate, and other obligations in the ordinary course of business. we expect to make future cash payments according to the contract terms. these agreements are enforceable and legally binding and specify fixed amounts or minimum quantities to be purchased. some agreements may contain cancellation provisions, some of which may require us to pay a termination fee. over half of these commitments are due in the next 12 months. we are reimbursed from the exchange and its subsidiaries for the portion of these costs related to administrative services.
we maintain relationships and cash balances at diversified and well-capitalized financial institutions and have established processes to monitor them. we believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our current and future cash requirements.
volatility in the financial markets presents challenges to us as we occasionally access our investment portfolio as a source of cash.  some of our fixed income investments, despite being publicly traded, may be illiquid.  volatility in these markets could impair our ability to sell certain fixed income securities or cause such securities to sell at deep discounts.  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our needs from sources other than the liquidation of securities.

capital outlook we regularly prepare forecasts evaluating the current and future cash requirements for both normal and extreme risk events, including under current inflationary conditions and a higher interest rate environment.  should an extreme risk event result in a cash requirement exceeding normal cash flows, we have the ability to meet our future funding requirements through various alternatives available to us.
outside of our normal operating and investing cash activities, future funding requirements could be met through: 1) unrestricted and unpledged cash and cash equivalents, which total approximately $128.7 million at december 31, 2023, 2) $100 million available bank revolving line of credit, and 3) liquidation of unpledged assets held in our investment portfolio, including equity securities and investment grade bonds which totaled approximately $799.0 million at december 31, 2023.  volatility in the financial markets could impair our ability to sell certain fixed income securities or cause such securities to sell at deep discounts.  additionally, we have the ability to curtail or modify discretionary cash outlays such as those related to shareholder dividends and share repurchase activities.
as of december 31, 2023, we have access to a $100 million bank revolving line of credit. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 8, bank line of credit, of notes to financial statements" for additional information.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have entered into certain contingent obligations for guarantees. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 16, commitments and contingencies, of notes to financial statements" for additional information. we do not believe that these obligations will have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
enterprise risk management the role of our enterprise risk management ("erm") function is to ensure that all significant risks are clearly identified, understood, proactively managed and consistently monitored to achieve strategic objectives for all stakeholders. our erm program views risk holistically across our entire group of companies. it ensures implementation of risk responses to mitigate potential impacts. see part i, item 1a. "risk factors" contained in this report for a list of risk factors.
our erm process is founded on a governance framework that includes oversight at multiple levels of our organization, including our board of directors and executive management. accountability to identify, manage, and mitigate risk is embedded within all functions and areas of our business. we have defined risk tolerances to monitor and manage significant risks within acceptable levels. in addition to identifying, evaluating, prioritizing, monitoring, and mitigating significant risks, our erm process includes extreme event analyses and scenario testing. given our defined tolerance for risk, risk model output is used to quantify the potential variability of future performance and the sufficiency of capital and liquidity levels.
transactions/agreements with related parties board oversight our board of directors has a broad oversight responsibility over our intercompany relationships with the exchange.  thus, our board of directors may be required to make decisions or take actions that may benefit subscribers at the exchange and the overall health of the exchange. these actions may ultimately benefit our shareholders.
insurance holding company system most states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems, defined as two or more affiliated persons, one or more of which is an insurer. the exchange has the following wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries: erie insurance company, erie insurance company of new york, erie insurance property & casualty company and flagship city insurance company, and a wholly owned life insurance company, erie family life insurance company. indemnity and the exchange, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, meet the definition of an insurance holding company system.
transactions within a holding company system affecting the member insurers of the holding company system must be fair and reasonable and any charges or fees for services performed must be reasonable.  approval by the applicable insurance commissioner is required prior to the consummation of certain transactions affecting the members within a holding company system.
intercompany agreements subscriber's and services agreements we serve as attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the exchange, a reciprocal insurance exchange.  each applicant for insurance to a reciprocal insurance exchange (a subscriber) signs a subscriber's agreement that contains an appointment of an attorney-in-fact.  through the designation of attorney-in-fact, we are required to provide policy issuance and renewal services and act as the attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the exchange with respect to all administrative services, as discussed previously.  in accordance with the subscriber's agreement, we retain a management fee for these services calculated as a percentage of the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the exchange. consistent with its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the exchange does not have any employees or officers. therefore, it enters into contractual relationships by and through the subscribers' attorney-in-fact. the exchange's insurance subsidiaries also utilize indemnity for all administrative services in accordance with the service agreements between each of the subsidiaries and indemnity. the subscriber's agreement and service agreements provide for reimbursement of amounts incurred for these services to indemnity.  reimbursements are settled at cost on a monthly basis. state insurance regulations require that intercompany service agreements and any material amendments be approved in advance by the state insurance department.
shared facilities the exchange and its subsidiaries have a service agreement with indemnity to use space in indemnity-owned properties. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 14, related party, of notes to financial statements" for additional details.
cost allocation the allocation of costs affects our financial condition and that of the exchange and its wholly owned subsidiaries. management's role is to determine that allocations are consistently made in accordance with the subscriber's agreement with the subscribers at the exchange, intercompany service agreements, and applicable insurance laws and regulations. allocation of costs under these various agreements requires judgment and interpretation by indemnity, and such allocations are performed using a consistent methodology, which is intended to adhere to the terms and intentions of the underlying agreements.
intercompany receivables we have significant receivables from the exchange and its affiliates that result in a concentration of credit risk. net receivables from the exchange and other affiliates were $625.3 million, or 25.3% of total assets, at december 31, 2023 and $524.9 million, or 23.4% of total assets, at december 31, 2022. these receivables include management fees due for policy issuance and renewal services performed by us under the subscriber's agreement, and certain costs we incur acting as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the subscribers at the exchange as well as the service provider for the exchange's insurance subsidiaries with respect to all administrative services, as discussed previously. these receivables from the exchange and other affiliates are settled monthly. we continually monitor the financial strength of the exchange.
other loans receivable in december 2023, we issued two senior secured loans totaling $13.6 million to fund a real estate development project supporting revitalization efforts in our community. ownership in the project includes related party and unrelated investors. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 14,  related party, of notes to financial statements" for additional details.

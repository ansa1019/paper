inventory devon's inventories primarily consist of oil and ngl inventory and equipment inventory. oil and ngl inventory are recorded at weighted average cost and carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. equipment inventory is valued at weighted average cost and reviewed periodically for obsolescence or impairment when market conditions indicate.
property and equipment oil and gas property and equipment devon follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas properties. exploration costs, such as exploratory geological and geophysical costs, and costs associated with nonproductive exploratory wells, delay rentals and exploration overhead are charged against earnings as incurred. costs of drilling successful exploratory wells along with acquisition costs and the costs of drilling development wells, including those that are unsuccessful, are capitalized. devon groups its oil and gas properties with a common geological structure or stratigraphic condition ("common operating field") for purposes of computing dd&a, assessing proved property impairments and accounting for asset dispositions. exploratory drilling costs and exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending the determination of proved reserves. if proved reserves are found, drilling costs remain capitalized as proved properties. costs of unsuccessful wells are charged to exploration expense. for exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot be classified as proved when drilling is completed, costs continue to be capitalized as suspended exploratory well costs if there have been sufficient reserves found to justify completion as a producing well and sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. if management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed. in some instances, this determination may take longer than one year. devon reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs quarterly. capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties are depleted by an equivalent unit-of-production method, converting gas to oil at the ratio of six mcf of gas to one bbl of oil. proved leasehold acquisition costs, less accumulated amortization, are depleted over total proved reserves, which includes proved undeveloped reserves. capitalized costs of wells and related equipment and facilities, including estimated asset retirement costs, net of estimated salvage values and less accumulated amortization are depreciated over proved developed reserves associated with those capitalized costs. depletion is calculated by applying the dd&a rate (amortizable base divided by beginning of period proved reserves) to current period production. costs associated with unproved properties are excluded from the depletion calculation until it is determined whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to such properties. devon assesses its unproved properties for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. significant unproved properties are assessed individually. proved properties are assessed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a common operating field. if there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is assessed for potential impairment by management through an established process. if, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax reserve cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. because there is usually a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants or by comparable transactions. the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are typically based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, and capital investment plans, considering all available information at the date of review. 60 table of contents index to financial statements devon energy corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements - (continued) gains or losses are recorded for sales or dispositions of oil and gas properties which constitute an entire common operating field or which result in a significant alteration of the common operating field's dd&a rate. these gains and losses are classified as asset dispositions in the accompanying statements of comprehensive earnings. partial common operating field sales or dispositions deemed not to significantly alter the dd&a rates are generally accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized. devon capitalizes interest costs incurred that are attributable to material unproved oil and gas properties and major development projects of oil and gas properties. other property and equipment costs for midstream assets that are in use are depreciated over the assets' estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method. depreciation and amortization of other property and equipment, including corporate and leasehold improvements, are provided using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives ranging from three to 60
years. interest costs incurred and attributable to major corporate construction projects are also capitalized.
asset retirement obligations devon recognizes liabilities for retirement obligations associated with tangible long-
lived assets, such as producing well sites when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of such assets and the amount can be reasonably estimated. the initial measurement of an asset retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its fair value, with an offsetting asset retirement cost recorded as an increase to the associated property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet unless the associated asset has already been disposed. when the assumptions used to estimate a recorded asset retirement obligation change, a revision is recorded to both the asset retirement obligation and the asset retirement cost. devon's asset retirement obligations also include estimated environmental remediation costs which arise from normal operations and are associated with the retirement of such long-lived assets. the asset retirement cost is depreciated using a systematic and rational method similar to that used for the associated property and equipment.
leases devon establishes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than 12 months. devon's right-of-use operating lease assets are for certain leases related to real estate, drilling rigs and other equipment related to the exploration, development and production of oil and gas. devon's right-of-use financing lease assets are related to real estate. certain of devon's lease agreements include variable payments based on usage or rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation.
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of business combinations over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. such test includes a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if the qualitative assessment determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. the quantitative goodwill impairment test requires the fair value of the reporting unit be compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based upon market capitalization, comparable transactions of similar companies and premiums paid. devon performed impairment tests of goodwill in the fourth quarters of 2023, 2022 and
2021. no impairment was required as a result of the annual tests in these time periods.

commitments and contingencies liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation or other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. liabilities for environmental remediation or restoration claims resulting from allegations of improper operation of assets are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. expenditures related to such environmental matters are expensed or capitalized in accordance with devon's accounting policy for property and equipment.
fair value measurements certain of devon's assets and liabilities are measured at fair value at each reporting date. fair value represents the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. this price is commonly referred to as the "exit price." fair value measurements are classified according to a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs underlying the valuation techniques. this hierarchy consists of three broad levels: • level 1 - inputs consist of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and have the highest priority. when available, devon measures fair value using level 1 inputs because they generally provide the most reliable evidence of fair value. •
level 2 - inputs consist of quoted prices that are generally observable for the asset or liability. common examples of level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets not considered to be active. • level 3 - inputs are not observable from objective sources and have the lowest priority. the most common level 3 fair value measurement is an internally developed cash flow model.
noncontrolling interests noncontrolling interests represent third-party ownership in the net assets of devon's consolidated subsidiaries and are presented as a component of equity. changes in devon's ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in deconsolidation are recognized in equity.
recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted in december 2023, the fasb issued asu 2023-09, improvements to income tax disclosures. asu 2023-09 intends to provide investors with enhanced information about an entity's income taxes by requiring disclosure of items such as disaggregation of the effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information regarding income taxes paid. this asu is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued.
devon is evaluating the impact this asu will have on the disclosures that accompany its consolidated financial statements. in november 2023, the fasb issued asu 2023-07, improvements to reportable segments disclosures. under this asu, the scope and frequency of segment disclosures is increased to provide investors with additional detail about information utilized by an entity's "chief operating decision maker." this asu is effective for devon beginning with our 2024 annual reporting and interim periods beginning in 2025. devon is evaluating the impact this asu will have on the disclosures that accompany its consolidated financial statements.

acquisitions and divestitures wpx merger on january 7, 2021 , devon and wpx completed an all-stock merger of equals. wpx was an oil and gas exploration and production company with assets in the delaware basin in texas and new mexico and the williston basin in north dakota. on the closing date of the merger, each share of wpx common stock was automatically converted into the right to receive 0.5165 of a share of devon common stock. no fractional shares of devon's common stock were issued in the merger, and holders of wpx common stock instead received cash in lieu of fractional shares of devon common stock, if any. based on the closing price of devon's common stock on january 7, 2021, the total value of devon common stock issued to holders of wpx common stock as part of this transaction was approximately $
5.4 billion. the merger was structured as a tax-free reorganization for u.s. federal income tax purposes.
acquisitions in the third quarter of 2022, devon completed its acquisition of producing properties and leasehold interests located in the eagle ford and williston basin for cash consideration of approximately $ 1.7 billion and $
830 million, respectively, net of purchase price adjustments. the total estimated proved reserves associated with these eagle ford and williston basin assets were approximately 87 mmboe and 66 mmboe, respectively. each of these acquisitions were accounted for as asset acquisitions as substantially all of the fair value was concentrated in a group of similar assets. each of the acquisitions resulted in the purchase of producing properties and leasehold interests in a defined geographical and geological area, and substantially all of the assets have similar risk characteristics. contingent earnout payments devon is entitled to contingent earnout payments associated with the sale of its barnett shale assets in 2020 with upside participation beginning at a $ 2.75 henry hub natural gas price or a $ 50 wti oil price. the contingent payment period commenced on january 1, 2021 and has a term of four years. devon received $ 20 million in contingent earnout payments related to this transaction in the first quarter of 2024 and $ 65 million in the first quarter of 2023 and 2022. devon could also receive up to an additional $ 65
million in contingent earnout payments for the remaining performance period depending on future commodity prices.
the valuation of the future contingent earnout payment included within other current assets and other long-term assets in the december 31, 2023 consolidated balance sheet was approximately $ 20 million and $ 35 million, respectively. these values were derived utilizing a monte carlo valuation model and qualify as a level 3 fair value measurement. devon also received $ 4 million in contingent earnout payments in the first quarter of 2023 and 2022
related to the sale of non-core assets in the rockies. devon completed the sale of these non-core assets in 2021
for proceeds of $ 9 million, net of purchase price adjustments, and recognized a $ 35 million gain related to the sale.

restricted stock awards and units restricted stock awards and units are subject to the terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations, if any, that the compensation committee deems appropriate, including restrictions on continued employment. generally, the service requirement for vesting ranges fromonetofour years. dividends declared during the vesting period with respect to restricted stock awards and units will not be paid until the underlying award vests. devon estimates the fair values of restricted stock awards and units as the closing price of devon's common stock on the grant date of the award, which is expensed over the applicable vesting period.
performance share units performance share units are granted to certain members of devon's management and employees. each unit that vests entitles the recipient to one share of devon common stock. the vesting of these units is based on comparing devon's tsr to the tsr of a predetermined group of peer companies over the specifiedthree-yearperformance period. subject to certain limits, the vesting of units may be betweenzeroand200% of the units granted depending on devon's tsr as compared to the peer group as of the end of the performance period.

at vesting, recipients receive dividend equivalents with respect to the number of units vested. the fair value of each performance share unit is estimated as of the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation with the following assumptions used for all grants made under the plan: (i) a risk-free interest rate based on u.s. treasury rates as of the grant date; (ii) a volatility assumption based on the historical realized price volatility of devon and the designated peer group; and (iii) an estimated ranking of devon among the designated peer group. the fair value of the unit on the date of grant is expensed over the applicable vesting period.the following table presents the assumptions related to performance share units granted.

devon has guaranteed performance through 2026 for a minimum volume commitment associated with assets divested in
2018. due to improved commodity prices, market conditions, and performance by the purchaser of the assets, the purchaser was able to fully satisfy the performance obligation due in 2023 and 2022, as well as reimburse devon for shortfall payments previously made on the purchasers' behalf in 2021 and 2020. additionally, at march 31, 2022, devon reduced the estimated future exposure of the performance guarantee. the effect of these cash collections and liability revisions resulted in a $144million benefit in 2022.
during 2022, devon paid approximately $20million for humanitarian relief for the ukrainian people and surrounding countries supporting refugees.
during 2022 and 2021, devon received severance and other non-income tax refunds of $5million and $39million, respectively, related to prior periods.

2023
in 2023, devon recognized income tax credits associated with its qualified research activities. this includes actual credits generated in the 2018-2022 tax years as well as estimated credits for the 2023 tax year.
2021
prior to 2021, devon maintained a valuation allowance against all u.s. federal deferred tax assets. devon recognized approximately $250million of deferred tax liabilities to account for the merger. the recognition of these deferred tax liabilities caused a decrease to devon's net deferred tax assets and a corresponding decrease to the valuation allowance devon had recognized on its u.s. federal deferred tax assets.
due to significant increases in commodity pricing and projections of future income, in the fourth quarter of 2021, devon reassessed its evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years and determined that a u.s. federal valuation allowance was no longer necessary. as such, devon removed its remaining $84million u.s.
federal valuation allowance.

retirement plans defined contribution plans devon sponsors defined contribution plans covering its employees. such plans include its 401(k) plan and enhanced contribution plan. devon makes matching contributions and additional retirement contributions, with the matching contributions being primarily based upon percentages of annual compensation and years of service. in addition, each plan is subject to regulatory limitations by the u.s. government. devon contributed $38million, $37million and
$33million to these plans in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
defined benefit plans devon has various non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, including qualified plans and nonqualified plans covering eligible employees and former employees meeting certain age and service requirements. benefits under the defined benefit plans have been closed to new employees and effective, as of december 31, 2020, devon's benefits committee approved a freeze of all future benefit accruals under the plans.
benefits are primarily funded from assets held in the plans' trusts.

expected return on plan assets- this was determined by evaluating input from external consultants and economists, as well as long-term inflation assumptions and consideration of target allocation of investment types.
mortality rate- devon utilized the society of actuaries produced mortality tables.
other assumptions- for measurement of the 2023 benefit obligation for the other postretirement medical plans, a6.6%
annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2024. the rate was assumed to decrease annually to an ultimate rate of5% in the year 2031 and remain at that level thereafter.

commitments and contingencies devon is party to various legal actions arising in connection with its business. matters that are probable of unfavorable outcome to devon and which can be reasonably estimated are accrued. such accruals are based on information known about the matters, devon's estimates of the outcomes of such matters and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. none of the actions are believed by management to likely involve future amounts that would be material to devon's financial position or results of operations after consideration of recorded accruals. actual amounts could differ materially from management's estimates.
royalty matters numerous oil and natural gas producers and related parties, including devon, have been named in various lawsuits alleging royalty underpayments. devon is currently named as a defendant in a number of such lawsuits,
83
table of contents index to financial statements devon energy corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)
including some lawsuits in which the plaintiffs seek to certify classes of similarly situated plaintiffs. among the allegations typically asserted in these suits are claims that devon used below-market prices, made improper deductions, paid royalty proceeds in an untimely manner without including required interest, used improper measurement techniques and entered into gas purchase and processing arrangements with affiliates that resulted in underpayment of royalties in connection with oil, natural gas and ngls produced and sold. devon is also involved in governmental agency proceedings and royalty audits and is subject to related contracts and regulatory controls in the ordinary course of business, some that may lead to additional royalty claims.
environmental and climate change matters devon's business is subject to numerous federal, state, tribal and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties, as well as remediation costs. although devon believes that it is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on its business, there can be no assurance that this will continue in the future.
beginning in 2013, various parishes in louisiana filed suit against numerous oil and gas companies, including devon, alleging that the companies' operations and activities in certain fields violated the state and local coastal resource management act of 1978, as amended, and caused substantial environmental contamination, subsidence and other environmental damages to land and water bodies located in the coastal zone of louisiana. the plaintiffs'
claims against devon relate primarily to the operations of several of devon's corporate predecessors. the plaintiffs seek, among other things, payment of the costs necessary to clear, re-vegetate and otherwise restore the allegedly impacted areas. although devon cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, devon denies the allegations in these lawsuits and intends to vigorously defend against these claims.
the state of delaware and various municipalities and other governmental and private parties in california have filed legal proceedings against numerous oil and gas companies, including devon, seeking relief to abate alleged impacts of climate change. these proceedings include far-reaching claims for monetary damages and injunctive relief. although devon cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, devon denies the allegations asserted in these lawsuits and intends to vigorously defend against these claims.
other indemnifications and legacy matters pursuant to various sale agreements relating to divested businesses and assets, devon has indemnified various purchasers against liabilities that they may incur with respect to the businesses and assets acquired from devon.
additionally, federal, state and other laws in areas of former operations may require previous operators (including corporate successors of previous operators) to perform or make payments in certain circumstances where the current operator may no longer be able to satisfy the applicable obligation. such obligations may include plugging and abandoning wells, removing production facilities, undertaking other restorative actions or performing requirements under surface agreements in existence at the time of disposition.
in november 2020, the department of the interior, bureau of safety and environmental enforcement ordered several oil and gas operators, including devon, to perform decommissioning and reclamation activities on two california offshore oil and gas production platforms and related facilities. the current operator and owner of the platforms contends that it does not have the financial ability to perform these obligations and relinquished the related federal lease in october 2020. in response to the apparent insolvency of the current operator, the government has ordered the former operators and alleged former lease record title owners to decommission the platforms and related facilities. the government contends that an alleged corporate predecessor of devon owned a partial interest in the subject lease and platforms. devon denies any obligation to decommission the subject platforms and has appealed the order. in the third quarter of 2023, devon settled certain defense and indemnity claims against a third party
84
table of contents index to financial statements devon energy corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements - (continued)
related to these potential decommissioning obligations. pursuant to that settlement agreement, devon received a settlement payment in the fourth quarter of 2023 which devon believes will offset any potential decommissioning liability it may incur related to the subject platforms. although devon continues to pursue its appeal of the government's order and deny any obligation to decommission the subject platforms, in conjunction with the third-
party settlement, devon recorded an increase to its asset retirement obligations in 2023.

earnout payments the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values in the table above.
level 1 fair value measurements cash equivalents- amounts consist primarily of money market investments and the fair value approximates the carrying value.
level 2 fair value measurements commodity derivatives- the fair value of commodity derivatives is estimated using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward curves and data obtained from independent third parties for contracts with similar terms or data obtained from counterparties to the agreements.
debt- devon's debt instruments do not consistently trade actively in an established market. the fair values of its debt are estimated based on rates available for debt with similar terms and maturity when active trading is not available.
level 3 fair value measurements contingent earnout payments- devon has the right to receive contingent consideration related to the barnett asset divestiture based on future oil and gas prices. these values were derived using a monte carlo valuation model and qualify as a level 3 fair value measurement. for additional information, seenote 2.

(1) gas reserves are converted to boe at the rate of six mcf per bbl of oil, based upon the approximate relative energy content of gas and oil. ngl reserves are converted to boe on a one-to-one basis with oil. the conversion rates are not necessarily indicative of the relationship of oil, natural gas and ngl prices.
price revisions reserves decreased78mmboe in 2023 primarily due to price decreases in the trailing 12 month averages for oil, gas and ngls.
reserves increased34mmboe in 2022 primarily due to price increases in the trailing 12 month averages for oil, gas and ngls.

reserves increased155mmboe in 2021 primarily due to price increases in the trailing 12 month averages for oil, gas and ngls.
revisions other than price
2023- total revisions other than price (-1mmboe) are the result of upward revisions due to well performance exceeding previous estimates on developed properties (11mmboe), which were offset by downward revisions to proved undeveloped reserves (-12mmboe) as noted below. in total, we recorded modest upward revisions in the delaware basin
(7mmboe), eagle ford (5mmboe), anadarko basin (4mmboe) and powder river basin (2mmboe) which were offset by downward revisions in the williston basin (-19mmboe) due to reduced well performance compared to previous estimates.
2022- total revisions other than price (-49mmboe) were driven by higher operating costs across all areas of operation and revisions to proved undeveloped reserves. these downward revisions were partially offset by upward revisions due to well performance exceeding previous estimates primarily in the delaware basin. in total, after accounting for these compensating factors, we recorded negative revisions across each of our operating areas with the most significant changes being located in the delaware basin (-33mmboe), followed by the powder river basin
(-5mmboe) and the anadarko basin (-4mmboe).
2021- total revisions other than price (43mmboe) were primarily due to well performance exceeding previous estimates modestly across all areas of operation (53mmboe) and the removal of proved undeveloped locations
(-10mmboe). the upward revisions were driven by the delaware basin (23mmboe), williston basin (12mmboe) and anadarko basin (12mmboe).
extensions and discoveries each year, devon's proved reserves extensions and discoveries consist of adding proved undeveloped reserves to locations classified as undeveloped at year-end and adding proved developed reserves from successful development wells drilled on locations outside the areas classified as proved at the previous year-end. therefore, it is not uncommon for devon's total proved extensions and discoveries to differ from the extensions and discoveries for devon's proved undeveloped reserves. furthermore, because annual additions are classified according to reserve determinations made at the previous year-end and because devon operates a multi-basin portfolio with assets at varying stages of maturity, extensions and discoveries for proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves can differ significantly in any particular year.
2023- of the322mmboe of additions from extensions and discoveries,212mmboe were in the delaware basin,33mmboe were in the anadarko basin,32mmboe were in eagle ford,26mmboe were in the powder river basin and19mmboe were in the williston basin.
2022- of the278mmboe of additions from extensions and discoveries,255mmboe were in the delaware basin,7mmboe were in the powder river basin,6mmboe were in eagle ford,5mmboe were in the anadarko basin and5mmboe were in the williston basin.
2021- of the228mmboe of additions from extensions and discoveries,209mmboe were in the delaware basin,8mmboe were in the anadarko basin,6mmboe were in the williston basin,3mmboe were in eagle ford and2mmboe were in the powder river basin.
purchase of reserves during 2022, devon had reserve additions due to the acquisitions of66mmboe in the williston basin and87mmboe in the eagle ford. for additional information on these asset additions, seenote 2.

2023
total proved undeveloped reserves decreased1% from 2022 to 2023 with the year-end 2023 balance representing22% of total proved reserves. approximately59% of the177mmboe in extensions and discoveries were the result of devon's drilling and development activities in the delaware basin, followed by the anadarko basin (14%), eagle ford (12%), powder river basin (11%) and williston basin (4%). development in the delaware basin accounted for approximately78%
of the165mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves being converted to proved developed reserves in 2023. costs incurred in 2023 to develop and convert devon's proved undeveloped reserves were approximately $1.5billion. proved undeveloped reserves revisions other than price (-12mmboe) were due to changes in previously adopted development plans (-8mmboe) in the williston basin (-5mmboe), delaware basin (-2mmboe) and powder river basin (-1mmboe), combined with modest downward revisions (-4mmboe) caused by continued evaluation of well performance in the delaware basin (-2mmboe), williston basin (-1mmboe) and eagle ford (-1mmboe).

future cash inflows, development costs and production costs were computed using the same assumptions for prices and costs that were used to estimate devon's proved oil and gas reserves at the end of each year. for 2023 estimates, devon's future realized prices were assumed to be $76.29per bbl of oil, $1.74per mcf of gas and $20.43per bbl of ngls. of the $5.2billion of future development costs as of the end of 2023, $1.8billion, $1.0billion and
$0.8billion are estimated to be spent in 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively.
future development costs include not only development costs but also future asset retirement costs. included as part of the $5.2billion of future development costs are $0.9billion of future asset retirement costs. the future income tax expenses have been computed using statutory tax rates, giving effect to allowable tax deductions and tax credits under current laws.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis presents management's perspective of our business, financial condition and overall performance. this information is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance, current financial condition and outlook for the future and should be read in conjunction with "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.
the following discussion and analyses primarily focus on 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 that are not included in this report can be found in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in part ii, item 7 of our 2022 annual report on form 10-k.
executive overview we are a leading independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company whose operations are focused onshore in the united states. our operations are currently focused in five core areas: the delaware basin, eagle ford, anadarko basin, williston basin and powder river basin. our asset base is underpinned by premium acreage in the economic core of the delaware basin and our diverse, top-tier resource plays provide a deep inventory of opportunities for years to come. in the third quarter of 2022, we acquired additional producing properties and leasehold interests in both the williston basin and eagle ford that were complementary to our existing acreage, offered operational synergies and added additional high-quality inventory to our portfolio. moving forward into 2024, we plan to refine our capital allocation by further concentrating investment in the delaware basin. by shifting more capital to the core of this world-class basin and high-grading activity across the rest of our diversified portfolio, we anticipate delivering meaningful improvements to our capital efficiency which will position us to generate growth in free cash flow which can be returned to shareholders.
we remain focused on building economic value by executing on our strategic priorities of moderating production growth, emphasizing capital and operational efficiencies, optimizing reinvestment rates to maximize free cash flow, maintaining low leverage, delivering cash returns to our shareholders and pursuing esg excellence. our recent performance highlights for these priorities include the following items for 2023:
•oil production totaled 320 mbbls/d, which is a 7% increase year over year.
•through 2023, completed approximately 77% of our authorized $3.0 billion share repurchase program, with approximately 45 million of our common shares repurchased for approximately $2.3 billion, or $51.05 per share, since inception of the plan.
•retired $242 million of senior notes.
•exited with $3.9 billion of liquidity, including $0.9 billion of cash.
•generated $6.5 billion of operating cash flow.
•including variable dividends, paid dividends of approximately $1.9 billion.
•earnings attributable to devon were $3.7 billion, or $5.84 per diluted share.
•core earnings (non-gaap) were $3.7 billion, or $5.71 per diluted share.
we remain committed to capital discipline and delivering the objectives that underpin our current plan. those objectives prioritize value creation through moderated capital investment and production growth, particularly with a view of the volatility in commodity prices, supply chain constraints and the economic uncertainty arising from inflation and geopolitical events. our cash-return objectives remain focused on opportunistic share repurchases, funding our fixed and variable dividends, repaying debt at upcoming maturities and building cash balances.
our net earnings and operating cash flow are highly dependent upon oil, gas and ngl prices which can be incredibly volatile due to several varying factors. commodity prices strengthened during 2022 as the continued recovery from the covid-19 pandemic increased demand for oil and gas commodities, while economic sanctions imposed on russia and restraint from opec+ on production index to financial statements growth both simultaneously impacted the supply of these commodities. in 2023, commodity prices weakened primarily due to economic uncertainty surrounding inflation and increased interest rates as well as certain geopolitical events. the graphs below show the trends in commodity prices over the past three years and their related impact on our net earnings, operating cash flow and capital investments.
as we dependably generate strong cash flow results as shown above, we will continue to prioritize delivering cash returns to shareholders through share repurchases and our fixed plus variable dividend strategy while maintaining a strong liquidity position. since the inception of our authorized $3.0 billion share repurchase program, we have repurchased approximately 45 million common shares for approximately $2.3 billion, or $51.05 per share. we also returned value to shareholders by paying dividends of approximately $1.9 billion during 2023. we exited 2023 with $3.9 billion of liquidity, comprised of $0.9 billion of cash and $3.0 billion of available credit under our 2023 senior credit facility. we currently have $6.2 billion of debt outstanding, of which approximately $483 million is classified as short-term. additionally, to help mitigate the volatility of commodity prices and protect ourselves from downside risk, we currently have approximately 30% and 20% of our anticipated 2024 oil and gas production hedged, respectively.
index to financial statements business and industry outlook in 2023, devon marked its 52nd anniversary in the oil and gas business and its 35th year as a public company. we generated nearly $6.5 billion of operating cash flow in 2023 as a result of the strength of our portfolio of assets and our operational execution. our portfolio benefited from highly complementary assets that were acquired in 2022. our 2023 operating cash flow was materially lower than 2022 as commodity prices declined from 2022 highs and cost inflation increased in 2023.
we remain committed to continuing our track record of industry leading return of capital to our shareholders, underpinned by low capital reinvestment rates and a disciplined, returns-driven strategy which is designed to be successful through economic cycles. in line with this strategy, we returned $2.8 billion of cash to shareholders through fixed and variable cash dividends and share repurchases in 2023. for 2024, we are targeting approximately 70% of our free cash flow to be returned to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases.
in 2023, wti oil prices averaged $77.62 per bbl versus $94.39 per bbl in 2022, reflecting a downward trend as oil prices remained volatile even with continued capital discipline by global oil producers. the market price for crude oil is currently expected to be lower in 2024 due to concerns of a global economic slowdown driven by high interest rates and high inflation that could weaken economic activity and oil demand. additionally, oil prices could remain volatile as uncertainty still exists from the impact of sanctioned russian oil in the global market, as well as actions taken by opec+ countries in supporting a balanced global crude supply. growing supply from u.s. oil producers could also weigh down prices in 2024 by dampening the impact of opec+ supply cuts. henry hub natural gas prices fell in 2023, averaging $2.74 per mcf compared to $6.65 per mcf in 2022. for 2024, natural gas prices are expected to remain consistent with 2023 prices due to high storage levels from an abundance of supply and milder winter weather, weakening economic conditions in some sectors leading to lower demand, and continued alternative energy diversification. our 2024 cash flow is partly protected from commodity price volatility due to our current hedge position that covers approximately 30% of our anticipated oil volumes and 20% of our anticipated gas volumes. in order to further insulate our cash flow, we continue to examine and, when appropriate, execute attractive regional basis swap hedges to protect price realizations across our portfolio.
our commitment to capital discipline and capital efficiency remains unchanged with our 2024 capital program. similar to 2023, the majority of our 2024 capital, or approximately 60%, is expected to be focused on our highest returning oil play, the delaware basin. the remainder of our 2024 capital will continue to be deployed to our other core areas of eagle ford, williston basin, anadarko basin and powder river basin but with a reduced activity level in some of these areas, particularly the williston basin. our 2024 capital is expected to be approximately 10% lower than 2023 due to this activity reduction and due to other identified cost reductions. our capital efficiency is expected to improve as lower 2024 capital offsets the impact of lower oil production from reduced 2024 activity. due to our strategy of spending within cash flow, we expect to continue generating material amounts of free cash flow for 2024.
results of operations the following graph, discussion and analysis are intended to provide an understanding of our results of operations and current financial condition. to facilitate the review, these numbers are being presented before consideration of earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. analysis of the change in net earnings is shown below.
our 2023 net earnings were $3.8 billion, compared to net earnings of $6.0 billion for 2022. the graph below shows the change in net earnings from 2022 to 2023. the material changes are further discussed by category on the following pages.

loe expenses and loe per boe increased primarily due to acquisitions in the eagle ford and williston basin that both closed in the third quarter of 2022, along with inflation and higher volumes resulting from increased activity in the delaware basin and anadarko basin. this is partially offset by decreased production taxes due to lower commodity prices.

investment activity during 2023 and 2022, devon received distributions from our investments of $32 million and $39 million, respectively. devon contributed $53 million and $76 million to our investments during 2023 and 2022, respectively.
debt activity during 2023, we repaid $242 million of senior notes at maturity.
shareholder distributions and stock activity we repurchased 19.1 million shares of common stock for $979 million in 2023 and 11.7 million shares of common stock for $718 million in 2022 under the share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors. for additional information, see note 17 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" in this report.
the following table summarizes our common stock dividends in 2023 and 2022. devon has raised its fixed dividend multiple times over the past two calendar years to $0.20 per share beginning in the first quarter of 2023. in addition to the fixed quarterly dividend, we paid a variable dividend in each quarter of 2023 and 2022. for additional information, see note 17 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.

liquidity the business of exploring for, developing and producing oil and natural gas is capital intensive. because oil, natural gas and ngl reserves are a depleting resource, we, like all upstream operators, must continually make capital investments to grow and even sustain production. generally, our capital investments are focused on drilling and completing new wells and maintaining production from existing wells. at opportunistic times, we also acquire operations and properties from other operators or land owners to enhance our existing portfolio of assets.
historically, our primary sources of capital funding and liquidity have been our operating cash flow, cash on hand and asset divestiture proceeds. additionally, we maintain a commercial paper program, supported by our revolving line of credit, which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow and cash balances. if needed, we can also issue debt and equity securities, including through transactions under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec. we estimate the combination of our sources index to financial statements of capital will continue to be adequate to fund our planned capital requirements, as discussed in this section, as well as execute our cash-return business model.
operating cash flow key inputs into determining our planned capital investment is the amount of cash we hold and operating cash flow we expect to generate over the next one to three or more years. at the end of 2023, we held approximately $900 million of cash. our operating cash flow forecasts are sensitive to many variables and include a measure of uncertainty as actual results may differ from our expectations.
commodity prices - the most uncertain and volatile variables for our operating cash flow are the prices of the oil, gas and ngls we produce and sell. prices are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions. regional and worldwide economic activity, weather and other highly variable factors influence market conditions for these products. these factors, which are difficult to predict, create volatility in prices and are beyond our control.
to mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices, we utilize various derivative financial instruments to protect a portion of our production against downside price risk. the key terms to our oil, gas and ngl derivative financial instruments as of december 31, 2023 are presented in note 3 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.
further, when considering the current commodity price environment and our current hedge position, we expect to achieve our capital investment priorities. additionally, we remain committed to capital discipline and focused on delivering the objectives that underpin our capital plan for 2024. the currently elevated level of cost inflation has eroded, and could continue to erode, our cost efficiencies gained over previous years and pressure our margin in 2024. despite this, we expect to continue generating material amounts of free cash flow at current commodity price levels due to our strategy of spending within cash flow.
operating expenses - commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses. significant commodity price decreases can lead to a decrease in drilling and development activities. as a result, the demand and cost for people, services, equipment and materials may also decrease, causing a positive impact on our cash flow as the prices paid for services and equipment decline. however, the inverse is also generally true during periods of rising commodity prices. we expect to mitigate the impact of cost inflation through efficiencies gained from the scale of our operations as well as by leveraging our long-standing relationships with our suppliers.
credit losses - our operating cash flow is also exposed to credit risk in a variety of ways. this includes the credit risk related to customers who purchase our oil, gas and ngl production, the collection of receivables from joint interest owners for their proportionate share of expenditures made on projects we operate and counterparties to our derivative financial contracts. we utilize a variety of mechanisms to limit our exposure to the credit risks of our customers, joint interest owners and counterparties. such mechanisms include, under certain conditions, requiring letters of credit, prepayments or collateral postings.
credit availability we have $3.0 billion of available borrowing capacity under our 2023 senior credit facility at december 31, 2023. the 2023 senior credit facility matures on march 24, 2028, with the option to extend the maturity date by three additional one-year periods subject to lender consent. the 2023 senior credit facility supports our $3.0 billion of short-term credit under our commercial paper program. as of december 31, 2023, there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program. see note 13 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report for further discussion.
the 2023 senior credit facility contains only one material financial covenant. this covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization, as defined in the credit agreement, of no more than 65%. as of december 31, 2023, we were in compliance with this covenant with a 22% debt-to-capitalization ratio.
our access to funds from the 2023 senior credit facility is not subject to a specific funding condition requiring the absence of a "material adverse effect". it is not uncommon for credit agreements to include such provisions. in general, these provisions can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the borrower's financial condition, operations, properties or business considered as a whole, the borrower's ability to make timely debt payments or the enforceability of material terms of the credit agreement. while our credit agreement includes provisions qualified by material adverse effect as well as a covenant that requires us to report a condition or event having a material adverse effect, the obligation of the banks to fund the 2023 senior credit facility is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect.
index to financial statements as market conditions warrant and subject to our contractual restrictions, liquidity position and other factors, we may from time to time seek to repurchase or retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other debt or equity securities in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. any such cash repurchases by us may be funded by cash on hand or incurring new debt. the amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. furthermore, any such repurchases or exchanges may result in our acquiring and retiring a substantial amount of such indebtedness, which would impact the trading liquidity of such indebtedness.
debt ratings we receive debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the u.s. in determining our debt ratings, the agencies consider a number of qualitative and quantitative items including, but not limited to, commodity pricing levels, our liquidity, asset quality, reserve mix, debt levels, cost structure, planned asset sales and size and scale of our production. our credit rating from standard and poor's financial services is bbb with a stable outlook. our credit rating from fitch is bbb+ with a stable outlook. our credit rating from moody's investor service is baa2 with a stable outlook. any rating downgrades may result in additional letters of credit or cash collateral being posted under certain contractual arrangements.
there are no "rating triggers" in any of our contractual debt obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should our debt rating fall below a specified level. however, a downgrade could adversely impact our interest rate on any credit facility borrowings and the ability to economically access debt markets in the future.
cash returns to shareholders we are committed to returning approximately 70% of our free cash flow to shareholders through a fixed dividend, variable dividend and share repurchases. our board of directors will consider a number of factors when setting the quarterly dividend, if any, including a general target of paying out approximately 10% of operating cash flow through the fixed dividend. in addition to the fixed quarterly dividend, we may pay a variable dividend or complete share repurchases. each quarter's free cash flow, which is a non-gaap measure, is computed as operating cash flow (a gaap measure) before balance sheet changes less capital expenditures. the declaration and payment of any future dividend, whether fixed or variable, will remain at the full discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial results, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the board.
in february 2024, devon raised its fixed dividend by 10%, to $0.22 per share, and announced a cash dividend in the amount of $0.44 per share payable in the first quarter of 2024. the dividend consists of a fixed quarterly dividend in the amount of approximately $140 million (or $0.22 per share) and a variable dividend in the amount of approximately $140 million (or $0.22 per share).
our board of directors has authorized a $3.0 billion share repurchase program that expires on december 31, 2024. through february 23, 2024, we had executed $2.4 billion of the authorized program.
capital expenditures our 2024 capital expenditure budget is expected to be approximately $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion, which is approximately 10% lower than our 2023 capital expenditures. in 2024, we plan to refine our capital allocation by further concentrating investment in the delaware basin.
contractual obligations as of december 31, 2023, our material contractual obligations include debt, interest expense, asset retirement obligations, lease obligations, retained obligations related to our divested canadian business, operational agreements, drilling and facility obligations and various tax obligations. as discussed above, we estimate the combination of our sources of capital will continue to be adequate to fund our short- and long-term contractual obligations. see notes 5, 7, , ,  and 18 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report for further discussion.
in february 2024, devon committed to invest approximately $90 million in a geothermal technology company and expects to fund the commitment throughout 2024.
index to financial statements contingencies and legal matters for a detailed discussion of contingencies and legal matters, see note 18 in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this report.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual amounts could differ from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. we consider the following to be our most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment and have reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.
oil and gas assets accounting, classification, reserves & valuation successful efforts method of accounting and classification we utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities which requires management's assessment of the proper designation of wells and associated costs as developmental or exploratory. this classification assessment is dependent on the determination and existence of proved reserves, which is a critical estimate discussed in the section below. the classification of developmental and exploratory costs has a direct impact on the amount of costs we initially recognize as exploration expense or capitalize, then subject to dd&a calculations and impairment assessments and valuations.
once a well is drilled, the determination that proved reserves have been discovered may take considerable time and requires both judgment and application of industry experience. development wells are always capitalized. costs associated with drilling an exploratory well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether proved reserves have been found. at the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs to determine whether the costs should continue to remain capitalized or shall be expensed. when making this determination, management considers current activities, near-term plans for additional exploratory or appraisal drilling and the likelihood of reaching a development program. if management determines future development activities and the determination of proved reserves are unlikely to occur, the associated suspended exploratory well costs are recorded as dry hole expense and reported in exploration expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings. otherwise, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized. at december 31, 2023, all material suspended well costs have been suspended for less than one year.
similar to the evaluation of suspended exploratory well costs, costs for undeveloped leasehold, for which reserves have not been proven, must also be evaluated for continued capitalization or impairment. at the end of each quarter, management assesses undeveloped leasehold costs for impairment by considering future drilling plans, drilling activity results, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects. at december 31, 2023, devon had approximately $501 million of undeveloped leasehold costs. of the remaining undeveloped leasehold costs at december 31, 2023, none is scheduled to expire in 2024.
reserves our estimates of proved and proved developed reserves are a major component of dd&a calculations. additionally, our proved reserves represent the element of these calculations that require the most subjective judgments. estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data, projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures. the process of estimating oil, gas and ngl reserves requires substantial judgment, resulting in imprecise determinations, particularly for new discoveries. different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data. our engineers prepare our reserve estimates. we then subject certain of our reserve estimates to audits performed by a third-party petroleum consulting firm. in 2023, 90% of our proved reserves were subjected to such an audit.
the passage of time provides additional information which may result in revisions to previous estimates to reflect updated information. in the past five years, annual revisions other than price to our proved reserve estimates, which have been both increases and decreases in individual years, have averaged approximately 3% of the previous year's estimate. however, there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future. for example, revisions may be driven broadly by index to financial statements economic factors such as significant changes in operating costs, or they may be more focused such as in a given area or reservoir. the data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.
valuation of long-lived assets long-lived assets used in operations, including proved and unproved oil and gas properties, are depreciated and assessed for impairment annually or whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows is expected to be generated by an asset group. for dd&a calculations and impairment assessments, management groups individual assets based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level ("common operating field") for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. the determination of common operating fields is largely based on geological structural features or stratigraphic condition, which requires judgment. management also considers the nature of production, common infrastructure, common sales points, common processing plants, common regulation and management oversight to make common operating field determinations. these determinations impact the amount of dd&a recognized each period and could impact the determination and measurement of a potential asset impairment.
management evaluates assets for impairment through an established process in which changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes and future development plans are reviewed. if, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants. the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are typically based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital investment plans, considering all available information at the date of review. the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews include future production volumes associated with proved producing and risk-adjusted proved undeveloped reserves, and when needed, probable and possible reserves.
besides the risk-adjusted estimates of reserves and future production volumes, future commodity prices are the largest driver in the variability of undiscounted pre-tax cash flows. for our impairment determinations, we utilize nymex forward strip prices and incorporate internally generated price forecasts along with price forecasts published by reputable investment banks and reservoir engineering firms to estimate our future revenues.
we also estimate and escalate or de-escalate future capital and operating costs by using a method that correlates cost movements to price movements similar to recent history. to measure indicated impairments, we use a market-based weighted-average cost of capital to discount the future net cash flows. changes to any of the reserves or market-based assumptions can significantly affect estimates of undiscounted and discounted pre-tax cash flows and impact the recognition and amount of impairments.
none of our oil and gas assets were at risk of impairment as of december 31, 2023.
income taxes the amount of income taxes recorded requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of federal, state, provincial and foreign tax jurisdictions. we recognize current tax expense based on estimated taxable income for the current period and the applicable statutory tax rates. we routinely assess potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, estimate and establish accruals for such amounts. we have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences, operating losses and other tax carryforwards. we routinely assess our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets by a valuation allowance if we deem it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
further, in the event we were to undergo an "ownership change" (as defined in section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended), our ability to use net operating losses and tax credits generated prior to the ownership change may be limited. generally, an "ownership change" occurs if one or more shareholders, each of whom owns five percent or more in value of a corporation's stock, increase their aggregate percentage ownership by more than 50 percent over the lowest percentage of stock owned by those shareholders at any time during the preceding three-year period. based on currently available information, we do not believe an ownership change has occurred during 2023 for devon, but the merger did cause an ownership change for wpx.
index to financial statements on august 16, 2022, the ira was signed into law and included various income tax related provisions with an effective date beginning in 2023. among the enacted provisions are a 15% camt and several new and expanded clean energy credits and incentives. the camt will be assessed on applicable corporations with an average annual afsi that exceeds $1 billion for the preceding three consecutive years. we have made an accounting policy election to not consider the effects of the camt on the realizability of our deferred tax assets, carryforwards and other tax credits and will instead account for any such effects as a period cost when they arise. we believe we are subject to the camt as we had an average annual afsi that exceeded $1 billion for the three-year period ended december 31, 2022. incremental taxes attributable to the camt are possible and such taxes may be significant.
non-gaap measures core earnings we make reference to "core earnings attributable to devon" and "core earnings per share attributable to devon" in "overview of 2023 results" in this item 7 that are not required by or presented in accordance with gaap. these non-gaap measures are not alternatives to gaap measures and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results reported under gaap. core earnings attributable to devon, as well as the per share amount, represent net earnings excluding certain noncash and other items that are typically excluded by securities analysts in their published estimates of our quarterly financial results. our non-gaap measures are typically used as a quarterly performance measure. amounts excluded for 2023 and 2022 relate to asset dispositions, noncash asset impairments (including unproved asset impairments), deferred tax asset valuation allowance and fair value changes in derivative financial instruments.
amounts excluded for 2021 relate to asset dispositions, noncash asset impairments (including unproved asset impairments), deferred tax asset valuation allowance, changes in tax legislation, fair value changes in derivative financial instruments, restructuring and transaction costs associated with the workforce reductions in 2021 and costs associated with the early retirement of debt.
we believe these non-gaap measures facilitate comparisons of our performance to earnings estimates published by securities analysts. we also believe these non-gaap measures can facilitate comparisons of our performance between periods and to the performance of our peers.
index to financial statements below are reconciliations of our core earnings and earnings per share to their comparable gaap measures.

ebitdax and field-level cash margin to assess the performance of our assets, we use ebitdax and field-level cash margin. we compute ebitdax as net earnings before income tax expense; financing costs, net; exploration expenses; dd&a; asset impairments; asset disposition gains and losses; non-cash share-based compensation; non-cash valuation changes for derivatives and financial instruments; restructuring and transaction costs; accretion on discounted liabilities; and other items not related to our normal operations. field-level cash margin is computed as oil, gas and ngl revenues less production expenses. production expenses consist of lease operating, gathering, processing and transportation expenses, as well as production and property taxes.
we exclude financing costs from ebitdax to assess our operating results without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. exploration expenses and asset disposition gains and losses are excluded from ebitdax because they generally are not indicators of operating efficiency for a given reporting period. dd&a and impairments are excluded from ebitdax because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred. we exclude share-based compensation, valuation changes, restructuring and transaction costs, accretion on discounted liabilities and other items from ebitdax because they are not considered a measure of asset operating performance.
we believe ebitdax and field-level cash margin provide information useful in assessing our operating and financial performance across periods. ebitdax and field-level cash margin as defined by devon may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should be considered in conjunction with net earnings from operations.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary as described further throughout this executive summary, citi demonstrated substantial progress across the franchise during 2023, despite the impact of several notable items in the fourth quarter:
•citi's revenues increased 4% versus the prior year, reflecting an increase in net interest income in services and u.s. personal banking (uspb), driven by higher interest rates, as well as loan growth in cards. the increase in revenues was partially offset by lower non-interest revenues, primarily driven by approximately $1.9 billion in aggregate translation losses (including approximately $880 million in the fourth quarter) due to devaluations of the argentine peso during the year, the impact of lower volatility in markets and the contraction of the global investment banking wallet in investment banking.
•citi's expenses increased 10% versus the prior year. the increase included fourth-quarter pretax charges of approximately $1.7 billion associated with the fdic special assessment and approximately $780 million of restructuring charges. excluding both of these charges, expenses increased 5%, driven by increased investments in other risk and controls and technology, elevated business-as-usual severance costs and additional transformation and business-led investments. the increase was partially offset by productivity savings and expense reductions from the exited markets and continued wind-downs (see "expenses" below).
•citi's cost of credit was $9.2 billion versus $5.2 billion in the prior year. the increase was primarily driven by higher cards net credit losses in branded cards and retail services, reflecting normalization from historically low levels. the increase was also due to net builds in the allowance for credit losses (acl), including approximately $1.9 billion in builds related to increases in transfer risk associated with exposures in russia and argentina (including approximately $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter), as well as builds due to volume growth in branded cards and retail services.
•citi returned $6.1 billion to common shareholders in the form of dividends ($4.1 billion) and share repurchases ($2.0 billion).
•citi's common equity tier 1 (cet1) capital ratio under the basel iii standardized approach increased to 13.4% as of december 31, 2023, compared to 13.0% as of december 31, 2022 (see "capital resources" below). this compares to citi's required regulatory cet1 capital ratio of 12.3% as of october 1, 2023 under the basel iii standardized approach.
•citi closed the four remaining signed consumer banking sale transactions in 2023. citi also continued to make progress with the wind-downs of the korea and china consumer banking businesses and the russia consumer, local commercial and institutional businesses, as well as the planned initial public offering of citi's consumer banking and small business and middle-market banking operations in mexico, and restarted the sales process for its poland consumer banking business.
2023 results summary citigroup citigroup reported net income of $9.2 billion, or $4.04 per share, compared to net income of $14.8 billion, or $7.00 per share in the prior year. net income decreased 38% versus the prior year, driven by the higher expenses, the higher cost of credit and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by the higher revenues. citigroup's effective tax rate was 27% in 2023 versus 19% in the prior year, largely driven by the geographic mix of earnings (see note 10).
as discussed above, results for 2023 included several notable items impacting pretax revenues, expenses and cost of credit:
•approximately $1.9 billion of aggregate translation losses in revenues due to devaluations of the argentine peso
•approximately $1.9 billion in aggregate reserve builds related to increases in transfer risk associated with exposures in russia and argentina, driven by safety and soundness considerations under u.s. banking law
•an approximate $1.7 billion charge to operating expenses related to the fdic special assessment in the fourth quarter
•approximately $780 million of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter, recorded in operating expenses in corporate/other within all other (managed basis), related to actions taken as part of citi's organizational simplification initiatives in total, on an after-tax basis the notable items were $(5.4) billion.
additionally, results for 2023 included pretax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $1.0 billion (approximately $659 million after-tax), primarily driven by gains on sale of citi's india and taiwan consumer banking businesses. (see "all other-divestiture-related impacts (reconciling items)" below.)
the above notable items and divestiture-related impacts, collectively, had a $2.40 negative impact on eps in 2023. for additional information on the translation losses due to the devaluations of the argentine peso, see "managing global risk-other risks-country risk-argentina" below and "services," "markets" and "banking" below. excluding the notable items and divestiture-related impacts, eps was $6.44. (as used throughout this form 10-k, citi's results of operations and financial condition excluding the notable items and divestiture-related impacts are non-gaap financial measures.)
results for 2022 included pretax divestiture-related impacts of $82 million. (see "all other-divestiture-related impacts (reconciling items)" below.) collectively, divestiture-related impacts had a $0.09 negative impact on eps. excluding divestiture-related impacts, eps in 2022 was $7.09. results in 2022 also included approximately $820 million of translation losses in revenues due to the devaluations of the argentine peso.
citigroup revenues of $78.5 billion in 2023 increased 4% on a reported basis. excluding divestiture-related impacts, revenues of $77.1 billion also increased 4% versus the prior year. excluding both divestiture-related and argentine peso devaluation impacts, revenues of $79 billion in 2023 increased 5% versus the prior year. the increase in revenues reflected strength across services and uspb, partially offset by declines in markets, banking and wealth, as well as the revenue reduction from the exited markets and continued wind-downs in all other (managed basis).
citigroup's end-of-period loans were $689 billion, up 5% versus the prior year, largely driven by growth in uspb.
citigroup's end-of-period deposits were approximately $1.3 trillion, down 4% versus the prior year. the decline in deposits was largely due to a reduction in services, reflecting quantitative tightening and a shift of deposits to higher-yielding investments in uspb and wealth in 2023. for additional information about citi's deposits by business, including drivers and deposit trends, see each respective business's results of operations and "liquidity risk-deposits" below.
expenses citigroup's operating expenses of $56.4 billion increased 10% from the prior year. in the fourth quarter of 2023, citi incurred the approximate $1.7 billion charge associated with the fdic special assessment and approximately $780 million of restructuring charges related to citi's organizational simplification initiatives (see note 9). expenses also included divestiture-related impacts of $372 million in 2023 and $696 million in the prior year. excluding divestiture-related impacts, expenses of $56 billion increased 11% versus the prior year. excluding divestiture-related impacts, the restructuring charges and the fdic special assessment, expenses of $53.5 billion increased 6%, driven by increased investments in other risk and controls and technology, elevated business-as-usual severance costs and additional transformation and business-led investments. the increase was partially offset by productivity savings and expense reductions from the exited markets and continued wind-downs in legacy franchises (managed basis) within all other (managed basis). citi expects to incur additional costs related to its organizational simplification in the first quarter of 2024.
cost of credit citi's total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims was a cost of $9.2 billion, compared to $5.2 billion in the prior year. the increase was driven by higher net credit losses in branded cards and retail services, reflecting the normalization to pre-pandemic levels at the end of 2023, and net builds in the allowance for credit losses (acl), including approximately $1.9 billion related to increases in transfer risk associated with exposures in russia and argentina (approximately $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter), as well as builds due to volume growth in branded cards and retail services. for additional information on citi's acl, including the builds for transfer risk, see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates-citi's allowance for credit losses (acl)" below.
net credit losses of $6.4 billion increased 70% from the prior year. consumer net credit losses of $6.2 billion increased 71%, largely reflecting the rise in cards net credit loss rates from historically low levels. corporate net credit losses increased to $250 million from $178 million.
citi expects to incur higher net credit losses in 2024, primarily due to higher cards net credit loss rates, which citi expects to rise above pre-pandemic levels and, on a full-year basis, peak in 2024. the higher net credit losses expectation is already reflected in the company's acl on loans for outstanding balances at december 31, 2023.
for additional information on citi's consumer and corporate credit costs, see each respective business's results of operations and "credit risk" below.
capital citigroup's cet1 capital ratio was 13.4% as of december 31, 2023, compared to 13.0% as of december 31, 2022, based on the basel iii standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets (rwa). the increase was primarily driven by net income, impacts from the sales of certain asia consumer banking (asia consumer) businesses and beneficial net movements in accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci), partially offset by the payment of common dividends, share repurchases and an increase in rwa.
in 2023, citi repurchased $2.0 billion of common shares and paid $4.1 billion of common dividends (see "unregistered sales of equity securities, repurchases of equity securities and dividends" below). citi will continue to assess common share repurchases on a quarter-by-quarter basis given uncertainty regarding regulatory capital requirements. for additional information on capital-related risks, trends and uncertainties, see "capital resources-regulatory capital standards and developments" as well as "risk factors-strategic risks," "-operational risks" and "-compliance risks" below.
citigroup's supplementary leverage ratio as of december 31, 2023 was 5.8%, unchanged from december 31, 2022 as higher tier 1 capital was offset by an increase in total leverage exposure. for additional information on citi's capital ratios and related components, see "capital resources" below.
services services net income of $4.6 billion decreased 6%, as higher expenses and higher cost of credit were partially offset by the increase in revenues. services expenses of $10.0 billion increased 15%, primarily driven by continued investment in technology and other risk and controls, volume-related expenses and business-led investments in treasury and trade solutions (tts), partially offset by the impact of productivity savings. cost of credit increased to $950 million from $207 million the prior year, largely driven by an acl build in other assets, primarily due to the reserve build for increases in transfer risk associated with exposures in russia and argentina.
services revenues of $18.1 billion increased 16%, driven by net interest income growth of 28%, partially offset by an 8% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of the argentine peso devaluations (approximately $1.2 billion in 2023 and approximately $0.4 billion in 2022). excluding this impact, non-interest revenue increased 6%.
tts revenues of $13.6 billion increased 16%, driven by 25% growth in net interest income, partially offset by an 11% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of the argentine peso devaluations. the increase in tts net interest income was primarily driven by higher interest rates and cost of funds management across currencies, as well as growth in deposits. excluding the impact of the currency devaluations, non-interest revenue increased 10%, driven by continued growth in underlying drivers.
securities services revenues of $4.4 billion increased 15%, as net interest income grew 46%, partially offset by a 5% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of the argentine peso devaluations. the increase in net interest income was driven by higher interest rates across currencies and cost of funds management, partially offset by lower average deposits.
excluding the impact of the currency devaluations, non-interest revenue increased 1%, driven by increased fees from higher auc/aua balances from new client business and deepening share of existing client wallet, as well as continued elevated levels of corporate activity in issuer services.
for additional information on the results of operations of services in 2023, see "services" below.
markets markets net income of $4.0 billion decreased 33%, driven by lower revenues, higher expenses and higher cost of credit. markets expenses of $13.2 billion increased 7%, primarily driven by investments in transformation, technology and other risk and controls, partially offset by productivity savings. cost of credit increased to $437 million from $155 million in the prior year, driven by an acl build in other assets, largely due to the reserve build for increases in transfer risk associated with exposures in russia and argentina.
markets revenues of $18.9 billion decreased 6%, driven by a 6% decrease in fixed income markets and a 9% decrease in equity markets. the decrease in fixed income was driven by a decrease in rates and currencies and spread products reflecting lower volatility, the impact of the argentine peso devaluations, a strong prior-year comparison and a significant slowdown in activity in december 2023. the decrease in equity markets was primarily due to a decline in equity derivatives, due to lower institutional activity, spread compression and lower volatility.
for additional information on the results of operations of markets in 2023, see "markets" below.
banking banking reported a net loss of $48 million, compared to net income of $386 million in the prior year, primarily driven by lower corporate lending revenues, including the impact of a loss on loan hedges, and higher expenses, partially offset by lower cost of credit. banking expenses of $4.9 billion increased 9%, primarily driven by the absence of an operational loss reserve release in the prior year, business-led investments and the impact of business-as-usual severance, partially offset by productivity savings. cost of credit was a benefit of $165 million, compared to cost of credit of $549 million in the prior year, driven by acl releases in loans and unfunded lending commitments, partially offset by an acl build in other assets.
banking revenues of $4.6 billion decreased 15%, including the $443 million loss on loan hedges in 2023 and the $307 million gain on loan hedges in the prior year. excluding the gain (loss) on loan hedges, banking revenues of $5.0 billion decreased 2%, as slightly higher revenues in investment banking were more than offset by lower corporate lending revenues. investment banking revenues of $2.5 billion increased 1%, driven by lower markdowns in non-investment-grade loan commitments. the increase in revenue was largely offset by an overall decline in global investment banking wallet, as heightened macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity. excluding the impact of the gain (loss) on loan hedges, corporate lending revenues decreased 4%, largely driven by lower volumes on continued balance sheet optimization. the decline in revenues also reflected approximately $134 million in translation losses in argentina due to devaluations of the argentine peso, including a $64 million translation loss in the fourth quarter of 2023. (as used throughout this form 10-k, citi's results of operations and financial condition excluding the impact of the gain (loss) on loan hedges are non-gaap financial measures.)
for additional information on the results of operations of banking in 2023, see "banking" below.
u.s. personal banking uspb net income of $1.8 billion decreased 34%, reflecting higher cost of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenues. uspb expenses increased 3%, primarily driven by continued investments in other risk and controls and technology, business-led investments and business-as-usual severance costs, partially offset by productivity savings. cost of credit increased to $6.7 billion, compared to $3.4 billion in the prior year. the increase was largely driven by higher net credit losses and a higher net acl build, primarily reflecting growth in loan balances in branded cards and retail services. net credit losses increased 79%, primarily reflecting normalization from historically low levels in u.s. cards, as net credit loss rates for both branded cards and retail services reached pre-pandemic levels at the end of 2023.
uspb revenues of $19.2 billion increased 14%, due to higher net interest income (up 12%), driven by strong loan growth and higher deposit spreads, as well as higher non-interest revenue (up 19%). branded cards revenues of $10.0 billion increased 11%, primarily driven by the higher net interest income, as average loans increased 13%. retail services revenues of $6.6 billion increased 21%, primarily driven by the higher net interest income from loan growth, as well as higher non-interest revenue due to the lower partner payments, driven by higher net credit losses. retail banking revenues of $2.6 billion increased 6%, primarily driven by higher deposit spreads and mortgage loan growth, partially offset by the impact of the transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposit balances to wealth.
for additional information on the results of operations of uspb in 2023, see "u.s. personal banking" below.
wealth wealth net income of $346 million decreased 64%, reflecting lower revenues and higher expenses, partially offset by lower cost of credit. wealth expenses increased 10% to $6.6 billion, primarily driven by continued investments in other risk and controls and technology, partially offset by productivity savings and re-pacing of strategic investments. cost of credit was a net benefit of $2 million, compared to cost of credit of $306 million in the prior year, largely driven by a net acl release.
wealth revenues of $7.1 billion decreased 5%, largely driven by lower net interest income (down 6%), driven by lower deposit spreads, as well as lower non-interest revenue (down 3%), largely driven by investment product revenue headwinds, partially offset by the benefits of the transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposit balances from uspb.
for additional information on the results of operations of wealth in 2023, see "wealth" below.
all other (managed basis)
all other (managed basis) net loss of $2.1 billion, compared to net income of $163 million in the prior year, was driven by higher expenses, primarily due to the $1.7 billion fdic special assessment, and higher cost of credit due to acl builds for loans in mexico consumer and other assets, reflecting an increase in transfer risk associated with exposures in russia. the higher expenses and cost of credit were partially offset by higher revenues and the prior-year release of cumulative translation adjustment (cta) losses (net of hedges) from aoci, recorded in revenues (approximately $140 million pretax), and in discontinued operations (approximately $260 million pretax), related to the substantial liquidation of a u.k. consumer legacy operation (see note 2).
for additional information on the results of operations of all other (managed basis) in 2023, see "all other-divestiture-related impacts (reconciling items)" and "all other (managed basis)" below.
macroeconomic and other risks and uncertainties various geopolitical, macroeconomic and regulatory challenges and uncertainties continue to adversely affect economic conditions in the u.s. and globally, including, among others, continued elevated interest rates, elevated inflation, and economic and geopolitical challenges related to china, the russia-ukraine war and escalating conflicts in the middle east. these and other factors have negatively impacted global economic growth rates and consumer sentiment and have resulted in a continued risk of recession in various regions and countries globally. in addition, these and other factors could adversely affect citi's customers, clients, businesses, funding costs, cost of credit and overall results of operations and financial condition during 2024.
for a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and risks that will or could impact citi's businesses, results of operations, capital and other financial condition during 2024, see "executive summary" above and "risk factors," each respective business's results of operations and "managing global risk," including "managing global risk-other risks-country risk-russia" and "-argentina" below.
citi's consent order compliance citi has embarked on a multiyear transformation, with the target outcome to change citi's business and operating models such that they simultaneously strengthen risk and controls and improve citi's value to customers, clients and shareholders.
this includes efforts to effectively implement the october 2020 federal reserve board (frb) and office of the comptroller of the currency (occ) consent orders issued to citigroup and citibank, respectively. in the second quarter of 2021, citi made an initial submission to the occ, and submitted its plans to address the consent orders to both regulators during the third quarter of 2021. citi continues to work constructively with the regulators and provides to both regulators on an ongoing basis additional information regarding its plans and progress. citi will continue to reflect their feedback in its project plans and execution efforts.
as discussed above, citi's efforts include continued investments in its transformation, including the remediation of its consent orders. citi's ceo has made the strengthening of citi's risk and control environment a strategic priority and has established a chief operating officer organization to centralize program management. in addition, the citigroup and citibank boards of directors each formed a transformation oversight committee, an ad hoc committee of each board, to provide oversight of management's remediation efforts under the consent orders. the citi board of directors has determined that citi's plans are responsive to the company's objectives and that progress continues to be made on execution of the plans.
for additional information about the consent orders, see "risk factors-compliance risks" below and citi's current report on form 8-k filed with the sec on october 7, 2020.

net income of $4.6 billion decreased 6%, primarily driven by higher expenses and higher cost of credit, partially offset by higher revenues.
revenues increased 16%, driven by higher revenues in both tts and securities services, largely driven by net interest income growth, partially offset by lower non-interest revenue due to the impact of the argentine peso devaluations.
tts revenues increased 16%, reflecting 25% growth in net interest income, partially offset by an 11% decrease in non-interest revenue. the increase in net interest income was primarily driven by higher interest rates and cost of funds management across currencies as well as growth in deposits. average deposits increased 2%, largely driven by growth in international markets. the decrease in non-interest revenue was driven by approximately $1.0 billion in translation losses in revenues in argentina due to devaluations of the argentine peso, including a $0.5 billion translation loss in the fourth quarter of 2023. excluding these translation losses, non-interest revenue grew 10%, reflecting continued growth in underlying drivers, including higher cross-border flows (up 15%), u.s. dollar clearing volumes (up 6%) and commercial card spend (up 16%).
securities services revenues increased 15%, as net interest income grew 46%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies and cost of funds management, partially offset by the impact of an 8% decline in average deposits and lower non-interest revenue. the decline in average deposits largely reflected the impact of monetary tightening. the decrease in non-interest revenue was driven by approximately $0.2 billion in translation losses in revenues in argentina due to the argentine peso devaluations, including a $0.1 billion translation loss in the fourth quarter of 2023. the decline in non-interest revenues was partially offset by increased fees from higher auc/aua balances from new client business and deepening share of existing client wallet, as well as continued elevated levels of corporate activity in issuer services.
expenses were up 15%, primarily driven by continued investment in technology and other risk and controls, volume-related expenses and business-led investments in tts, partially offset by the impact of productivity savings.
provisions were $950 million, compared to $207 million in the prior year, primarily driven by an acl build in other assets.
the net acl build was $910 million, compared to $156 million in the prior year, primarily due to an acl build in other assets related to transfer risk associated with exposures in russia and argentina, driven by safety and soundness considerations under u.s. banking law. for additional information on citi's acl, see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates" below.

2022 vs. 2021
net income of $4.9 billion increased 30%, primarily driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit.
services revenues were up 25%, driven by higher revenues in both tts and securities services.
tts revenues increased 29%, largely due to 49% growth in net interest income, reflecting deepening of existing client relations and gaining new clients across segments. the increase in net interest income was also driven by the benefits from higher interest rates, balance sheet optimization, higher average deposits and higher average loans. average deposits grew 1%, as volume growth was partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation. average loans grew 11%, primarily driven by the strength in trade flows in international, partially offset by loan sales in north america.
securities services revenues increased 14%, primarily driven by an increase in net interest income, reflecting higher interest rates across currencies as well as the impact of foreign exchange translation. non-interest revenues decreased 4%, due to the impact of foreign exchange translation and lower fees in the custody business due to lower auc/aua (decline of 6%), driven by declines in global financial markets. the decline in non-interest revenues was partially offset by continued elevated levels of corporate activity in issuer services and new client onboarding of $1.2 trillion in auc/aua. average deposits declined 1%, due to clients seeking higher rate alternatives.
expenses were up 13%, primarily driven by continued investment in citi's technology and other risk and controls, volume-related expenses and business-led investments in tts.
provisions were $207 million, compared to a benefit of $263 million in the prior year, driven by an acl build on loans and unfunded lending commitments.
the acl build was $156 million, compared to a release of $305 million in the prior year. the acl build was primarily driven by deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions.
markets markets provides corporate, institutional and public sector clients around the world with a full range of sales and trading services across equities, foreign exchange, rates, spread products and commodities. the range of services includes market-making across asset classes, risk management solutions, financing, prime brokerage, research, securities clearing and settlement.
as a market maker, markets facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. these price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are recorded in principal transactions. other primarily includes realized gains and losses on available-for-sale (afs) debt securities, gains and losses on equity securities not held in trading accounts and other non-recurring gains and losses. interest income earned on assets held, less interest paid on long- and short-term debt, secured funding transactions and customer deposits, is recorded as net interest income.
the amount and types of markets revenues are impacted by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor confidence; and other macroeconomic conditions. markets revenues include revenues earned by citi that are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement with banking-corporate lending for investment banking, markets and services products sold to corporate lending clients.
assuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in increases in revenues. however, changes in market conditions can significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and the fair value of product inventory. management of the markets businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluation of the above factors.
markets international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 95 countries and jurisdictions.

2023 vs. 2022
net income of $4.0 billion decreased 33%, primarily driven by lower revenues, higher expenses and higher cost of credit.
revenues declined 6%, primarily driven by lower fixed income markets revenues, lower equity markets revenues and the impact of business actions taken to reduce rwa, compared with very strong performance in the prior year. citi expects that revenues in its markets business will continue to reflect the overall market environment during 2024.
fixed income markets revenues decreased 6%. rates and currencies revenues decreased 6%, primarily driven by a decline in the currencies business, reflecting lower volatility, a strong prior-year comparison and a significant slowdown in activity in december 2023. the decline in rates and currencies revenues also reflected $526 million in translation losses in revenues in argentina due to the argentine peso devaluations, including $236 million in translation loss in the fourth quarter of 2023. spread products and other fixed income revenues decreased 5%, largely driven by lower client activity, lower volatility and a strong prior-year comparison.
equity markets revenues decreased 9%, primarily due to a decline in equity derivatives, due to lower institutional activity, spread compression and lower volatility. prime services revenues increased modestly, as prime finance balances grew, reflecting continued client momentum.
expenses increased 7%, primarily driven by investments in transformation, technology and other risk and controls, partially offset by productivity savings.
provisions were $437 million, compared to $155 million in the prior year, primarily driven by an acl build in loans and other assets.
the net acl build was $405 million, compared to $160 million in the prior year. the acl build for loans was $204 million, primarily driven by risks and uncertainties impacting vulnerable industries, including commercial real estate. the net acl build for other assets was $200 million, primarily driven by transfer risk associated with exposures in russia and argentina, driven by safety and soundness considerations under u.s. banking law. for additional information on citi's acl, see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates" below.

2022 vs. 2021
net income of $5.9 billion decreased 11%, primarily driven by higher cost of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.
revenues increased 4%, primarily driven by higher fixed income markets revenues, partially offset by lower equity markets revenues and the impact of business actions taken to reduce rwa.
fixed income markets revenues increased 10%. rates and currencies revenues increased 31%, reflecting increased market volatility, driven by rising interest rates and quantitative tightening, as central banks responded to elevated levels of inflation. spread products and other fixed income revenues decreased 25%, due to continued lower client activity across spread products and a challenging credit market due to widening spreads for most of the year. the decline in spread products and other fixed income revenues was partially offset by strength in commodities, particularly with corporate clients, as the business assisted those clients in managing risk associated with the increased volatility.
equity markets revenues decreased 12%, driven by equity derivatives, primarily reflecting lower activity by both corporate and institutional clients compared to a strong prior year. the lower revenues also reflected a decline in equity cash, driven by lower client activity.
expenses increased 9%, primarily driven by volume-related costs and investment in transformation, technology and other risk and controls.
provisions were $155 million, compared to a benefit of $329 million in the prior year, driven by a net acl build, partially offset by lower net credit losses.
net credit losses were a benefit of $5 million, compared to $97 million in the prior year, largely driven by improvements in portfolio credit quality.
the net acl build was $160 million, compared to a net release of $426 million in the prior year. the net acl build was primarily driven by a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions.

(1)    investment banking fees are primarily composed of underwriting, advisory, loan syndication structuring and other related financing activity.
(2)    includes revenues earned by citi that are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement with banking-corporate lending for investment banking, markets and services products sold to corporate lending clients.
(3)    credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. gain (loss) on loan hedges includes the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives, partially offset by the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. hedges on accrual loans reflect the mark-to-market on credit derivatives used to economically hedge the corporate loan accrual portfolio. the fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. citigroup's results of operations excluding the impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges is a non-gaap financial measure.
(4)    management uses this information in reviewing the segment's results and believes it is useful to investors concerning underlying segment performance and trends.
(5)    excludes loans that are carried at fair value for all periods.
nm not meaningful the discussion of the results of operations for banking below excludes (where noted) the impact of any gain (loss) on hedges of accrual loans, which are non-gaap financial measures. for a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.
2023 vs. 2022
net loss was $48 million, compared to net income of $386 million in the prior year, primarily driven by lower revenues and higher expenses, partially offset by lower cost of credit.
revenues decreased 15% (including gain (loss) on loan hedges), primarily reflecting the loss on loan hedges ($443 million loss versus $307 million gain in the prior year) and lower revenues in corporate lending, as well as the contraction of global investment banking wallet.
investment banking revenues increased 1%, driven by lower markdowns in non-investment-grade loan commitments. the increase in revenue was mainly offset by the overall decline in market wallet, as heightened macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity. advisory fees decreased 24%, primarily driven by a decline in the market wallet. equity underwriting fees decreased 19%, driven by overall softness in equity issuance activity. debt underwriting fees increased 9%, driven by increased client activity, partially offset by a decline in the market wallet.
corporate lending revenues decreased 30%, including the impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges. excluding the impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges, revenues decreased 4%, largely driven by lower volumes on continued balance sheet optimization. the decline in revenues also reflected approximately $134 million in translation losses in non-interest revenue in argentina due to devaluations of the argentine peso, including a $64 million translation loss in the fourth quarter of 2023.
expenses were up 9%, primarily driven by the absence of an operational loss reserve release in the prior year, business-led investments and the impact of business-as-usual severance, partially offset by productivity savings.
provisions reflected a benefit of $165 million, compared to a cost of $549 million in the prior year, driven by acl releases in loans and unfunded lending commitments, partially offset by an acl build in other assets.
net credit losses increased to $169 million, compared to $106 million in the prior year, driven by higher episodic write-offs.
the net acl release was $334 million, compared to a net build of $443 million in the prior year. the acl releases in loans and unfunded lending commitments were driven by an improved macroeconomic outlook. these releases were partially offset by an acl build in other assets, primarily related to transfer risk associated with exposures in argentina and russia, driven by safety and soundness considerations under u.s. banking law. for additional information on citi's acl, see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates" below.

2022 vs. 2021
net income of $386 million decreased 91%, primarily driven by lower revenues and higher cost of credit.
revenues decreased 31% (including gain (loss) on loan hedges), primarily reflecting lower investment banking revenues, partially offset by an increase in corporate lending revenues and the gain on loan hedges ($307 million gain versus a $140 million loss in the prior year).
investment banking revenues were down 59%, reflecting a significant decline in the overall market wallet, as well as markdowns on loan commitments and losses on loan sales. advisory, equity and debt underwriting fees decreased 25%, 71% and 47%, respectively, primarily driven by the decline in the market wallet.
corporate lending revenues increased 70%, including the impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges. excluding the impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges, revenues increased 41%, primarily driven by higher revenue share from investment banking, services and markets, partially offset by lower volumes and higher hedging costs.
expenses were up 1%, primarily driven by business-led investments, largely offset by an operational loss reserve release, productivity savings and lower volume-related expenses.
provisions were $549 million, compared to a benefit of $1.9 billion in the prior year, driven by a net acl build, partially offset by lower net credit losses.
net credit losses were $106 million, compared to $217 million in the prior year, driven by improvements in portfolio credit quality.
the net acl build was $443 million, compared to a net release of $2.1 billion in the prior year. the net acl build was primarily driven by a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions.

2023 vs. 2022
net income was $1.8 billion, compared to $2.8 billion in the prior year, reflecting higher cost of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.
revenues increased 14%, due to higher net interest income (up 12%), driven by strong loan growth and higher deposit spreads, as well as higher non-interest revenue (up 19%). the increase in non-interest revenue was largely driven by lower partner payments in retail services, due to higher net credit losses, and an increase in interchange fees, driven by higher card spend volumes in branded cards. the increase in non-interest revenue was partially offset by an increase in rewards costs in branded cards, driven by the higher card spend volumes.
cards revenues increased 15%. branded cards revenues increased 11%, primarily driven by the higher net interest income, reflecting the strong loan growth. branded cards new account acquisitions increased 9% and card spend volumes increased 5%. branded cards average loans increased 13%, reflecting the higher card spend volumes and lower card payment rates.
retail services revenues increased 21%, primarily driven by higher net interest income on higher loan balances, as well as higher non-interest revenue due to the lower partner payments, driven by the higher net credit losses (see note 5). retail services credit card spend volumes decreased 4% and average loans increased 9%, largely reflecting lower card payment rates.
retail banking revenues increased 6%, primarily driven by higher deposit spreads and mortgage loan growth, partially offset by the impact of the transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposit balances to wealth. average mortgage loans increased 16%, primarily driven by lower refinancings due to high interest rates and higher mortgage originations. average deposits decreased 4%, largely reflecting the transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposit balances to wealth.
expenses increased 3%, primarily driven by continued investments in other risk and controls, technology, business-led investments and business-as-usual severance costs, partially offset by productivity savings.
provisions were $6.7 billion, compared to $3.4 billion in the prior year, largely driven by higher net credit losses and a higher acl build for loans. net credit losses increased 79%, primarily reflecting higher losses in cards in line with expectations, with branded cards net credit losses up 93% to $2.7 billion and retail services net credit losses up 84% to $2.3 billion. both branded cards and retail services net credit losses reached pre-pandemic levels at the end of 2023.
the net acl build was $1.5 billion, compared to $0.5 billion in the prior year, primarily reflecting growth in loan balances in branded cards and retail services. for additional information on citi's acl, see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates" below.

2022 vs. 2021
net income was $2.8 billion, compared to $6.1 billion in the prior year, reflecting higher cost of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.
revenues increased 6%, primarily due to higher net interest income (up 11%), driven by strong loan growth in branded cards and retail services and the impact of higher interest rates in retail banking. the increase in revenues was partially offset by lower non-interest revenue, largely reflecting higher partner payments in retail services resulting from higher revenues.
cards revenues increased 8%. branded cards revenues increased 9%, primarily driven by higher net interest income on higher loan balances. branded cards new account acquisitions increased 11% and card spend volumes increased 16%. average loans increased 11%, reflecting the higher card spend volumes.
retail services revenues increased 7%, primarily driven by higher net interest income on higher loan balances and lower card payment rates, partially offset by the increase in partner payments. the increase in partner payments reflected higher income sharing as a result of higher revenues. retail services card spend volumes increased 8% and average loans increased 6%, reflecting the higher card spend volumes.
retail banking revenues decreased 2%, as the higher interest rates and modest deposit growth were more than offset by lower mortgage revenues due to fewer mortgage originations, driven by the higher interest rates. average deposits increased 3%, largely reflecting higher levels of consumer liquidity in the first half of 2022.
expenses increased 10%, primarily driven by continued investments in citi's transformation, other risk and control initiatives, volume-related expenses and business-led investments, partially offset by productivity savings.
provisions were $3.4 billion, compared to a benefit of $1.0 billion in the prior year, largely driven by a net acl build. net credit losses decreased 1%, driven by historically low loss rates experienced in the first half of 2022, partially offset by higher losses in the second half of the year, particularly in retail services (net credit losses up 7% to $1.3 billion). branded cards net credit losses declined 17% to $1.4 billion.
the net acl build was $0.5 billion, compared to a net release of $3.9 billion in the prior year, primarily driven by u.s. cards loan growth and a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions.

2023 vs. 2022
net income was $346 million, compared to $950 million in the prior year, reflecting lower revenues and higher expenses, partially offset by lower cost of credit.
revenues decreased 5%, largely driven by lower net interest income (down 6%), due to lower deposit spreads, as well as lower non-interest revenue (down 3%), largely driven by investment product revenue headwinds, partially offset by the benefits of the transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposit balances from uspb. average loans were largely unchanged. average deposits decreased 1%, reflecting transfers to higher-yielding investments on citi's platform. client balances increased 6%, primarily driven by higher client investment assets, partially offset by lower deposit balances.
private bank revenues decreased 17%, primarily driven by lower deposit spreads, lower deposit and loan volumes and the investment product revenue headwinds.
wealth at work revenues increased 18%, driven by improved lending spreads, primarily in mortgages, and higher investment product revenues, partially offset by lower deposit revenues.
citigold revenues were largely unchanged, as higher deposit revenues internationally were offset by lower deposit revenues in north america and lower lending revenues globally.
expenses increased 10%, primarily driven by continued investments in other risk and controls and technology, partially offset by productivity savings and re-pacing of strategic investments.
provisions were a benefit of $2 million, compared to provisions of $306 million in the prior year, largely driven by a net acl release.
the net acl release was $97 million, compared to a net build of $202 million in the prior year, primarily driven by improvements in macroeconomic assumptions. for additional information on citi's acl, see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates" below.

all other includes activities not assigned to the reportable operating segments (services, markets, banking, uspb and wealth), including legacy franchises and corporate/other. for additional information about legacy franchises and corporate/other, see "all other (managed basis)" below.
all other (managed basis) results exclude divestiture-related impacts (see the "reconciling items" column in the table below) related to (i) citi's divestitures of its asia consumer banking businesses and (ii) the planned divestiture or ipo of mexico consumer banking and small business and middle-market banking, within legacy franchises. legacy franchises (managed basis) results also exclude these divestiture-related impacts. certain of the results of operations of all other (managed basis) and legacy franchises (managed basis) are non-gaap financial measures (see "overview-non-gaap financial measures" above).
the table below presents a reconciliation from all other (u.s. gaap) to all other (managed basis). all other (u.s. gaap), less reconciling items, equals all other (managed basis). the reconciling items are fully reflected on each respective line item in citi's consolidated statement of income.

2023 vs. 2022
net loss was $2.1 billion, compared to net income of $163 million in the prior year, driven by higher expenses (largely related to the fdic special assessment and citi's restructuring charge) and higher cost of credit. the higher expenses and cost of credit were partially offset by higher revenues and the prior-year release of cta losses (net of hedges) from aoci, consisting of approximately $140 million recorded in revenues and approximately $260 million pretax recorded in discontinued operations, related to the substantial liquidation of a u.k. consumer legacy operation (see note 2).
all other (managed basis) revenues increased 4%, driven by higher revenues in corporate/other, partially offset by lower revenues in legacy franchises (managed basis).
legacy franchises (managed basis) revenues decreased 4%, primarily driven by lower revenues in asia consumer (managed basis), partially offset by higher revenues in mexico consumer/sbmm (managed basis).
mexico consumer/sbmm (managed basis) revenues increased 23%, as cards revenues in mexico consumer increased 31%, sbmm revenues increased 28% and retail banking revenues increased 19%, mainly due to the benefit of fx translation as well as higher interest rates and higher deposit and loan growth.
asia consumer (managed basis) revenues decreased 48%, primarily driven by the reduction from exited markets and wind-downs.
corporate/other revenues were $2.2 billion, compared to $1.5 billion in the prior year, driven by higher net interest income. the higher net interest income was primarily due to higher interest rates on deposits with banks and the investment portfolio, partially offset by higher cost of funds.
expenses increased 22%, primarily driven by the $1.7 billion fdic special assessment related to regional bank failures, restructuring charges and higher business-as-usual severance costs, partially offset by lower consulting expenses and lower expenses in both wind-down and exit markets. the restructuring charges were recorded in the fourth quarter and primarily consisted of severance costs associated with headcount reductions related to the organizational simplification initiatives (see note 9).
provisions were $1.3 billion, compared to $498 million in the prior year, driven by a higher net acl build for loans and other assets and higher net credit losses. net credit losses increased 13%, primarily driven by higher lending volumes in mexico consumer.
the net acl build for loans was $106 million, compared to a net release of $368 million in the prior year, primarily driven by higher lending volumes in mexico consumer. the net acl build in other assets was primarily due to the reserve build for transfer risk associated with exposures in russia, driven by safety and soundness considerations under u.s. banking law. for additional information on citi's acl, see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates" below.
for additional information about trends, uncertainties and risks related to all other's (managed basis) future results, see "executive summary" above and "risk factors" and "managing global risk-other risks-country risk-russia" below.
2022 vs. 2021
net income was $163 million, compared to net income of $1.0 billion in the prior year, primarily driven by lower revenues, higher cost of credit and the release of the cta losses (net of hedges) from aoci.
all other (managed basis) revenues decreased 5%, driven by lower revenues in legacy franchises (managed basis), and lower non-interest revenue in corporate/other, partially offset by higher net interest income in corporate/other.
legacy franchises (managed basis) revenues decreased 14%, primarily driven by lower revenues in asia consumer (managed basis) and legacy holdings assets, partially offset by higher revenues in mexico consumer/sbmm (managed basis).
mexico consumer/sbmm (managed basis) revenues increased 2%, as cards revenues in mexico consumer increased 6% and sbmm revenues increased 10%, primarily due to higher interest rates and higher deposit and loan growth. the increase in revenues was partially offset by a 1% decrease in retail banking revenues, primarily driven by lower fiduciary fees reflecting declines in equity market valuations.
asia consumer (managed basis) revenues decreased 25%, primarily driven by the loss of revenues from the closing of the exit markets and the impacts of the ongoing korea wind-down.
legacy holdings assets revenues of $(81) million decreased from $186 million in the prior year, largely driven by the cta loss (net of hedges) recorded in aoci, as well as the continued wind-down of legacy holdings assets.
corporate/other revenues were $1.5 billion, compared to $825 million in the prior year, driven by higher net interest income, partially offset by lower non-interest revenue. the higher net interest income was primarily due to the investment portfolio driven by higher balances, higher interest rates and lower mortgage-backed securities prepayments, partially offset by higher cost of funds related to higher institutional certificates of deposit. the lower non-interest revenue was primarily due to the absence of mark-to-market gains in the prior year as well as higher hedging costs.
expenses decreased 2%, primarily driven by lower consulting expenses, the impact of certain legal settlements and lower expenses in both wind-down and exit markets.
provisions were $498 million, compared to a benefit of $88 million in the prior year, primarily driven by a lower net acl release, partially offset by lower net credit losses. net credit losses decreased 48%, primarily reflecting improved delinquencies in both asia consumer and mexico consumer.
the net acl release was $368 million, compared to a net acl release of $1.7 billion in the prior year, driven by further improvement in portfolio credit quality.
capital resources management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary as described further throughout this executive summary, citi demonstrated substantial progress across the franchise during 2023, despite the impact of several notable items in the fourth quarter:
•citi's revenues increased 4% versus the prior year, reflecting an increase in net interest income in services and u.s. personal banking (uspb), driven by higher interest rates, as well as loan growth in cards. the increase in revenues was partially offset by lower non-interest revenues, primarily driven by approximately $1.9 billion in aggregate translation losses (including approximately $880 million in the fourth quarter) due to devaluations of the argentine peso during the year, the impact of lower volatility in markets and the contraction of the global investment banking wallet in investment banking.
•citi's expenses increased 10% versus the prior year. the increase included fourth-quarter pretax charges of approximately $1.7 billion associated with the fdic special assessment and approximately $780 million of restructuring charges. excluding both of these charges, expenses increased 5%, driven by increased investments in other risk and controls and technology, elevated business-as-usual severance costs and additional transformation and business-led investments. the increase was partially offset by productivity savings and expense reductions from the exited markets and continued wind-downs (see "expenses" below).
•citi's cost of credit was $9.2 billion versus $5.2 billion in the prior year. the increase was primarily driven by higher cards net credit losses in branded cards and retail services, reflecting normalization from historically low levels. the increase was also due to net builds in the allowance for credit losses (acl), including approximately $1.9 billion in builds related to increases in transfer risk associated with exposures in russia and argentina (including approximately $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter), as well as builds due to volume growth in branded cards and retail services.
•citi returned $6.1 billion to common shareholders in the form of dividends ($4.1 billion) and share repurchases ($2.0 billion).
•citi's common equity tier 1 (cet1) capital ratio under the basel iii standardized approach increased to 13.4% as of december 31, 2023, compared to 13.0% as of december 31, 2022 (see "capital resources" below). this compares to citi's required regulatory cet1 capital ratio of 12.3% as of october 1, 2023 under the basel iii standardized approach.
•citi closed the four remaining signed consumer banking sale transactions in 2023. citi also continued to make progress with the wind-downs of the korea and china consumer banking businesses and the russia consumer, local commercial and institutional businesses, as well as the planned initial public offering of citi's consumer banking and small business and middle-market banking operations in mexico, and restarted the sales process for its poland consumer banking business.
2023 results summary citigroup citigroup reported net income of $9.2 billion, or $4.04 per share, compared to net income of $14.8 billion, or $7.00 per share in the prior year. net income decreased 38% versus the prior year, driven by the higher expenses, the higher cost of credit and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by the higher revenues. citigroup's effective tax rate was 27% in 2023 versus 19% in the prior year, largely driven by the geographic mix of earnings (see note 10).
as discussed above, results for 2023 included several notable items impacting pretax revenues, expenses and cost of credit:
•approximately $1.9 billion of aggregate translation losses in revenues due to devaluations of the argentine peso
•approximately $1.9 billion in aggregate reserve builds related to increases in transfer risk associated with exposures in russia and argentina, driven by safety and soundness considerations under u.s. banking law
•an approximate $1.7 billion charge to operating expenses related to the fdic special assessment in the fourth quarter
•approximately $780 million of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter, recorded in operating expenses in corporate/other within all other (managed basis), related to actions taken as part of citi's organizational simplification initiatives in total, on an after-tax basis the notable items were $(5.4) billion.
additionally, results for 2023 included pretax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $1.0 billion (approximately $659 million after-tax), primarily driven by gains on sale of citi's india and taiwan consumer banking businesses. (see "all other-divestiture-related impacts (reconciling items)" below.)
the above notable items and divestiture-related impacts, collectively, had a $2.40 negative impact on eps in 2023. for additional information on the translation losses due to the devaluations of the argentine peso, see "managing global risk-other risks-country risk-argentina" below and "services," "markets" and "banking" below. excluding the notable items and divestiture-related impacts, eps was $6.44. (as used throughout this form 10-k, citi's results of operations and financial condition excluding the notable items and divestiture-related impacts are non-gaap financial measures.)
results for 2022 included pretax divestiture-related impacts of $82 million. (see "all other-divestiture-related impacts (reconciling items)" below.) collectively, divestiture-related impacts had a $0.09 negative impact on eps. excluding divestiture-related impacts, eps in 2022 was $7.09. results in 2022 also included approximately $820 million of translation losses in revenues due to the devaluations of the argentine peso.
citigroup revenues of $78.5 billion in 2023 increased 4% on a reported basis. excluding divestiture-related impacts, revenues of $77.1 billion also increased 4% versus the prior year. excluding both divestiture-related and argentine peso devaluation impacts, revenues of $79 billion in 2023 increased 5% versus the prior year. the increase in revenues reflected strength across services and uspb, partially offset by declines in markets, banking and wealth, as well as the revenue reduction from the exited markets and continued wind-downs in all other (managed basis).
citigroup's end-of-period loans were $689 billion, up 5% versus the prior year, largely driven by growth in uspb.
citigroup's end-of-period deposits were approximately $1.3 trillion, down 4% versus the prior year. the decline in deposits was largely due to a reduction in services, reflecting quantitative tightening and a shift of deposits to higher-yielding investments in uspb and wealth in 2023. for additional information about citi's deposits by business, including drivers and deposit trends, see each respective business's results of operations and "liquidity risk-deposits" below.
expenses citigroup's operating expenses of $56.4 billion increased 10% from the prior year. in the fourth quarter of 2023, citi incurred the approximate $1.7 billion charge associated with the fdic special assessment and approximately $780 million of restructuring charges related to citi's organizational simplification initiatives (see note 9). expenses also included divestiture-related impacts of $372 million in 2023 and $696 million in the prior year. excluding divestiture-related impacts, expenses of $56 billion increased 11% versus the prior year. excluding divestiture-related impacts, the restructuring charges and the fdic special assessment, expenses of $53.5 billion increased 6%, driven by increased investments in other risk and controls and technology, elevated business-as-usual severance costs and additional transformation and business-led investments. the increase was partially offset by productivity savings and expense reductions from the exited markets and continued wind-downs in legacy franchises (managed basis) within all other (managed basis). citi expects to incur additional costs related to its organizational simplification in the first quarter of 2024.
cost of credit citi's total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims was a cost of $9.2 billion, compared to $5.2 billion in the prior year. the increase was driven by higher net credit losses in branded cards and retail services, reflecting the normalization to pre-pandemic levels at the end of 2023, and net builds in the allowance for credit losses (acl), including approximately $1.9 billion related to increases in transfer risk associated with exposures in russia and argentina (approximately $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter), as well as builds due to volume growth in branded cards and retail services. for additional information on citi's acl, including the builds for transfer risk, see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates-citi's allowance for credit losses (acl)" below.
net credit losses of $6.4 billion increased 70% from the prior year. consumer net credit losses of $6.2 billion increased 71%, largely reflecting the rise in cards net credit loss rates from historically low levels. corporate net credit losses increased to $250 million from $178 million.
citi expects to incur higher net credit losses in 2024, primarily due to higher cards net credit loss rates, which citi expects to rise above pre-pandemic levels and, on a full-year basis, peak in 2024. the higher net credit losses expectation is already reflected in the company's acl on loans for outstanding balances at december 31, 2023.
for additional information on citi's consumer and corporate credit costs, see each respective business's results of operations and "credit risk" below.
capital citigroup's cet1 capital ratio was 13.4% as of december 31, 2023, compared to 13.0% as of december 31, 2022, based on the basel iii standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets (rwa). the increase was primarily driven by net income, impacts from the sales of certain asia consumer banking (asia consumer) businesses and beneficial net movements in accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci), partially offset by the payment of common dividends, share repurchases and an increase in rwa.
in 2023, citi repurchased $2.0 billion of common shares and paid $4.1 billion of common dividends (see "unregistered sales of equity securities, repurchases of equity securities and dividends" below). citi will continue to assess common share repurchases on a quarter-by-quarter basis given uncertainty regarding regulatory capital requirements. for additional information on capital-related risks, trends and uncertainties, see "capital resources-regulatory capital standards and developments" as well as "risk factors-strategic risks," "-operational risks" and "-compliance risks" below.
citigroup's supplementary leverage ratio as of december 31, 2023 was 5.8%, unchanged from december 31, 2022 as higher tier 1 capital was offset by an increase in total leverage exposure. for additional information on citi's capital ratios and related components, see "capital resources" below.
services services net income of $4.6 billion decreased 6%, as higher expenses and higher cost of credit were partially offset by the increase in revenues. services expenses of $10.0 billion increased 15%, primarily driven by continued investment in technology and other risk and controls, volume-related expenses and business-led investments in treasury and trade solutions (tts), partially offset by the impact of productivity savings. cost of credit increased to $950 million from $207 million the prior year, largely driven by an acl build in other assets, primarily due to the reserve build for increases in transfer risk associated with exposures in russia and argentina.
services revenues of $18.1 billion increased 16%, driven by net interest income growth of 28%, partially offset by an 8% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of the argentine peso devaluations (approximately $1.2 billion in 2023 and approximately $0.4 billion in 2022). excluding this impact, non-interest revenue increased 6%.
tts revenues of $13.6 billion increased 16%, driven by 25% growth in net interest income, partially offset by an 11% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of the argentine peso devaluations. the increase in tts net interest income was primarily driven by higher interest rates and cost of funds management across currencies, as well as growth in deposits. excluding the impact of the currency devaluations, non-interest revenue increased 10%, driven by continued growth in underlying drivers.
securities services revenues of $4.4 billion increased 15%, as net interest income grew 46%, partially offset by a 5% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of the argentine peso devaluations. the increase in net interest income was driven by higher interest rates across currencies and cost of funds management, partially offset by lower average deposits.
excluding the impact of the currency devaluations, non-interest revenue increased 1%, driven by increased fees from higher auc/aua balances from new client business and deepening share of existing client wallet, as well as continued elevated levels of corporate activity in issuer services.
for additional information on the results of operations of services in 2023, see "services" below.
markets markets net income of $4.0 billion decreased 33%, driven by lower revenues, higher expenses and higher cost of credit. markets expenses of $13.2 billion increased 7%, primarily driven by investments in transformation, technology and other risk and controls, partially offset by productivity savings. cost of credit increased to $437 million from $155 million in the prior year, driven by an acl build in other assets, largely due to the reserve build for increases in transfer risk associated with exposures in russia and argentina.
markets revenues of $18.9 billion decreased 6%, driven by a 6% decrease in fixed income markets and a 9% decrease in equity markets. the decrease in fixed income was driven by a decrease in rates and currencies and spread products reflecting lower volatility, the impact of the argentine peso devaluations, a strong prior-year comparison and a significant slowdown in activity in december 2023. the decrease in equity markets was primarily due to a decline in equity derivatives, due to lower institutional activity, spread compression and lower volatility.
for additional information on the results of operations of markets in 2023, see "markets" below.
banking banking reported a net loss of $48 million, compared to net income of $386 million in the prior year, primarily driven by lower corporate lending revenues, including the impact of a loss on loan hedges, and higher expenses, partially offset by lower cost of credit. banking expenses of $4.9 billion increased 9%, primarily driven by the absence of an operational loss reserve release in the prior year, business-led investments and the impact of business-as-usual severance, partially offset by productivity savings. cost of credit was a benefit of $165 million, compared to cost of credit of $549 million in the prior year, driven by acl releases in loans and unfunded lending commitments, partially offset by an acl build in other assets.
banking revenues of $4.6 billion decreased 15%, including the $443 million loss on loan hedges in 2023 and the $307 million gain on loan hedges in the prior year. excluding the gain (loss) on loan hedges, banking revenues of $5.0 billion decreased 2%, as slightly higher revenues in investment banking were more than offset by lower corporate lending revenues. investment banking revenues of $2.5 billion increased 1%, driven by lower markdowns in non-investment-grade loan commitments. the increase in revenue was largely offset by an overall decline in global investment banking wallet, as heightened macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity. excluding the impact of the gain (loss) on loan hedges, corporate lending revenues decreased 4%, largely driven by lower volumes on continued balance sheet optimization. the decline in revenues also reflected approximately $134 million in translation losses in argentina due to devaluations of the argentine peso, including a $64 million translation loss in the fourth quarter of 2023. (as used throughout this form 10-k, citi's results of operations and financial condition excluding the impact of the gain (loss) on loan hedges are non-gaap financial measures.)

u.s. personal banking uspb net income of $1.8 billion decreased 34%, reflecting higher cost of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenues. uspb expenses increased 3%, primarily driven by continued investments in other risk and controls and technology, business-led investments and business-as-usual severance costs, partially offset by productivity savings. cost of credit increased to $6.7 billion, compared to $3.4 billion in the prior year. the increase was largely driven by higher net credit losses and a higher net acl build, primarily reflecting growth in loan balances in branded cards and retail services. net credit losses increased 79%, primarily reflecting normalization from historically low levels in u.s. cards, as net credit loss rates for both branded cards and retail services reached pre-pandemic levels at the end of 2023.
uspb revenues of $19.2 billion increased 14%, due to higher net interest income (up 12%), driven by strong loan growth and higher deposit spreads, as well as higher non-interest revenue (up 19%). branded cards revenues of $10.0 billion increased 11%, primarily driven by the higher net interest income, as average loans increased 13%. retail services revenues of $6.6 billion increased 21%, primarily driven by the higher net interest income from loan growth, as well as higher non-interest revenue due to the lower partner payments, driven by higher net credit losses. retail banking revenues of $2.6 billion increased 6%, primarily driven by higher deposit spreads and mortgage loan growth, partially offset by the impact of the transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposit balances to wealth.
for additional information on the results of operations of uspb in 2023, see "u.s. personal banking" below.
wealth wealth net income of $346 million decreased 64%, reflecting lower revenues and higher expenses, partially offset by lower cost of credit. wealth expenses increased 10% to $6.6 billion, primarily driven by continued investments in other risk and controls and technology, partially offset by productivity savings and re-pacing of strategic investments. cost of credit was a net benefit of $2 million, compared to cost of credit of $306 million in the prior year, largely driven by a net acl release.
wealth revenues of $7.1 billion decreased 5%, largely driven by lower net interest income (down 6%), driven by lower deposit spreads, as well as lower non-interest revenue (down 3%), largely driven by investment product revenue headwinds, partially offset by the benefits of the transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposit balances from uspb.
for additional information on the results of operations of wealth in 2023, see "wealth" below.
all other (managed basis)
all other (managed basis) net loss of $2.1 billion, compared to net income of $163 million in the prior year, was driven by higher expenses, primarily due to the $1.7 billion fdic special assessment, and higher cost of credit due to acl builds for loans in mexico consumer and other assets, reflecting an increase in transfer risk associated with exposures in russia. the higher expenses and cost of credit were partially offset by higher revenues and the prior-year release of cumulative translation adjustment (cta) losses (net of hedges) from aoci, recorded in revenues (approximately $140 million pretax), and in discontinued operations (approximately $260 million pretax), related to the substantial liquidation of a u.k. consumer legacy operation (see note 2).

macroeconomic and other risks and uncertainties various geopolitical, macroeconomic and regulatory challenges and uncertainties continue to adversely affect economic conditions in the u.s. and globally, including, among others, continued elevated interest rates, elevated inflation, and economic and geopolitical challenges related to china, the russia-ukraine war and escalating conflicts in the middle east. these and other factors have negatively impacted global economic growth rates and consumer sentiment and have resulted in a continued risk of recession in various regions and countries globally. in addition, these and other factors could adversely affect citi's customers, clients, businesses, funding costs, cost of credit and overall results of operations and financial condition during 2024.
for a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and risks that will or could impact citi's businesses, results of operations, capital and other financial condition during 2024, see "executive summary" above and "risk factors," each respective business's results of operations and "managing global risk," including "managing global risk-other risks-country risk-russia" and "-argentina" below.
citi's consent order compliance citi has embarked on a multiyear transformation, with the target outcome to change citi's business and operating models such that they simultaneously strengthen risk and controls and improve citi's value to customers, clients and shareholders.
this includes efforts to effectively implement the october 2020 federal reserve board (frb) and office of the comptroller of the currency (occ) consent orders issued to citigroup and citibank, respectively. in the second quarter of 2021, citi made an initial submission to the occ, and submitted its plans to address the consent orders to both regulators during the third quarter of 2021. citi continues to work constructively with the regulators and provides to both regulators on an ongoing basis additional information regarding its plans and progress. citi will continue to reflect their feedback in its project plans and execution efforts.
as discussed above, citi's efforts include continued investments in its transformation, including the remediation of its consent orders. citi's ceo has made the strengthening of citi's risk and control environment a strategic priority and has established a chief operating officer organization to centralize program management. in addition, the citigroup and citibank boards of directors each formed a transformation oversight committee, an ad hoc committee of each board, to provide oversight of management's remediation efforts under the consent orders. the citi board of directors has determined that citi's plans are responsive to the company's objectives and that progress continues to be made on execution of the plans.
for additional information about the consent orders, see "risk factors-compliance risks" below and citi's current report on form 8-k filed with the sec on october 7, 2020.

2023 vs. 2022
net income of $4.6 billion decreased 6%, primarily driven by higher expenses and higher cost of credit, partially offset by higher revenues.
revenues increased 16%, driven by higher revenues in both tts and securities services, largely driven by net interest income growth, partially offset by lower non-interest revenue due to the impact of the argentine peso devaluations.
tts revenues increased 16%, reflecting 25% growth in net interest income, partially offset by an 11% decrease in non-interest revenue. the increase in net interest income was primarily driven by higher interest rates and cost of funds management across currencies as well as growth in deposits. average deposits increased 2%, largely driven by growth in international markets. the decrease in non-interest revenue was driven by approximately $1.0 billion in translation losses in revenues in argentina due to devaluations of the argentine peso, including a $0.5 billion translation loss in the fourth quarter of 2023. excluding these translation losses, non-interest revenue grew 10%, reflecting continued growth in underlying drivers, including higher cross-border flows (up 15%), u.s. dollar clearing volumes (up 6%) and commercial card spend (up 16%).
securities services revenues increased 15%, as net interest income grew 46%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies and cost of funds management, partially offset by the impact of an 8% decline in average deposits and lower non-interest revenue. the decline in average deposits largely reflected the impact of monetary tightening. the decrease in non-interest revenue was driven by approximately $0.2 billion in translation losses in revenues in argentina due to the argentine peso devaluations, including a $0.1 billion translation loss in the fourth quarter of 2023. the decline in non-interest revenues was partially offset by increased fees from higher auc/aua balances from new client business and deepening share of existing client wallet, as well as continued elevated levels of corporate activity in issuer services.
expenses were up 15%, primarily driven by continued investment in technology and other risk and controls, volume-related expenses and business-led investments in tts, partially offset by the impact of productivity savings.
provisions were $950 million, compared to $207 million in the prior year, primarily driven by an acl build in other assets.
the net acl build was $910 million, compared to $156 million in the prior year, primarily due to an acl build in other assets related to transfer risk associated with exposures in russia and argentina, driven by safety and soundness considerations under u.s. banking law. for additional information on citi's acl, see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates" below.

2022 vs. 2021
net income of $4.9 billion increased 30%, primarily driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit.
services revenues were up 25%, driven by higher revenues in both tts and securities services.
tts revenues increased 29%, largely due to 49% growth in net interest income, reflecting deepening of existing client relations and gaining new clients across segments. the increase in net interest income was also driven by the benefits from higher interest rates, balance sheet optimization, higher average deposits and higher average loans. average deposits grew 1%, as volume growth was partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation. average loans grew 11%, primarily driven by the strength in trade flows in international, partially offset by loan sales in north america.
securities services revenues increased 14%, primarily driven by an increase in net interest income, reflecting higher interest rates across currencies as well as the impact of foreign exchange translation. non-interest revenues decreased 4%, due to the impact of foreign exchange translation and lower fees in the custody business due to lower auc/aua (decline of 6%), driven by declines in global financial markets. the decline in non-interest revenues was partially offset by continued elevated levels of corporate activity in issuer services and new client onboarding of $1.2 trillion in auc/aua. average deposits declined 1%, due to clients seeking higher rate alternatives.
expenses were up 13%, primarily driven by continued investment in citi's technology and other risk and controls, volume-related expenses and business-led investments in tts.
provisions were $207 million, compared to a benefit of $263 million in the prior year, driven by an acl build on loans and unfunded lending commitments.
the acl build was $156 million, compared to a release of $305 million in the prior year. the acl build was primarily driven by deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions.
markets markets provides corporate, institutional and public sector clients around the world with a full range of sales and trading services across equities, foreign exchange, rates, spread products and commodities. the range of services includes market-making across asset classes, risk management solutions, financing, prime brokerage, research, securities clearing and settlement.
as a market maker, markets facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. these price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are recorded in principal transactions. other primarily includes realized gains and losses on available-for-sale (afs) debt securities, gains and losses on equity securities not held in trading accounts and other non-recurring gains and losses. interest income earned on assets held, less interest paid on long- and short-term debt, secured funding transactions and customer deposits, is recorded as net interest income.
the amount and types of markets revenues are impacted by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor confidence; and other macroeconomic conditions. markets revenues include revenues earned by citi that are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement with banking-corporate lending for investment banking, markets and services products sold to corporate lending clients.
assuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in increases in revenues. however, changes in market conditions can significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and the fair value of product inventory. management of the markets businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluation of the above factors.
markets international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 95 countries and jurisdictions.

(1)    investment banking fees are primarily composed of underwriting, advisory, loan syndication structuring and other related financing activity.
(2)    includes revenues earned by citi that are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement with banking-corporate lending for investment banking, markets and services products sold to corporate lending clients.
(3)    citi assesses its markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. for example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk managed by derivatives that are recorded in principal transactions revenue within non-interest revenue. for a description of the composition of these revenue line items, see notes 4, 5 and 6.
(4)    management uses this information in reviewing the segment's results and believes it is useful to investors concerning underlying segment performance and trends.
(5)    excludes loans that are carried at fair value for all periods.

2023 vs. 2022
net income of $4.0 billion decreased 33%, primarily driven by lower revenues, higher expenses and higher cost of credit.
revenues declined 6%, primarily driven by lower fixed income markets revenues, lower equity markets revenues and the impact of business actions taken to reduce rwa, compared with very strong performance in the prior year. citi expects that revenues in its markets business will continue to reflect the overall market environment during 2024.
fixed income markets revenues decreased 6%. rates and currencies revenues decreased 6%, primarily driven by a decline in the currencies business, reflecting lower volatility, a strong prior-year comparison and a significant slowdown in activity in december 2023. the decline in rates and currencies revenues also reflected $526 million in translation losses in revenues in argentina due to the argentine peso devaluations, including $236 million in translation loss in the fourth quarter of 2023. spread products and other fixed income revenues decreased 5%, largely driven by lower client activity, lower volatility and a strong prior-year comparison.
equity markets revenues decreased 9%, primarily due to a decline in equity derivatives, due to lower institutional activity, spread compression and lower volatility. prime services revenues increased modestly, as prime finance balances grew, reflecting continued client momentum.
expenses increased 7%, primarily driven by investments in transformation, technology and other risk and controls, partially offset by productivity savings.
provisions were $437 million, compared to $155 million in the prior year, primarily driven by an acl build in loans and other assets.
the net acl build was $405 million, compared to $160 million in the prior year. the acl build for loans was $204 million, primarily driven by risks and uncertainties impacting vulnerable industries, including commercial real estate. the net acl build for other assets was $200 million, primarily driven by transfer risk associated with exposures in russia and argentina, driven by safety and soundness considerations under u.s. banking law. for additional information on citi's acl, see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates" below.

2022 vs. 2021
net income of $5.9 billion decreased 11%, primarily driven by higher cost of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.
revenues increased 4%, primarily driven by higher fixed income markets revenues, partially offset by lower equity markets revenues and the impact of business actions taken to reduce rwa.
fixed income markets revenues increased 10%. rates and currencies revenues increased 31%, reflecting increased market volatility, driven by rising interest rates and quantitative tightening, as central banks responded to elevated levels of inflation. spread products and other fixed income revenues decreased 25%, due to continued lower client activity across spread products and a challenging credit market due to widening spreads for most of the year. the decline in spread products and other fixed income revenues was partially offset by strength in commodities, particularly with corporate clients, as the business assisted those clients in managing risk associated with the increased volatility.
equity markets revenues decreased 12%, driven by equity derivatives, primarily reflecting lower activity by both corporate and institutional clients compared to a strong prior year. the lower revenues also reflected a decline in equity cash, driven by lower client activity.
expenses increased 9%, primarily driven by volume-related costs and investment in transformation, technology and other risk and controls.
provisions were $155 million, compared to a benefit of $329 million in the prior year, driven by a net acl build, partially offset by lower net credit losses.
net credit losses were a benefit of $5 million, compared to $97 million in the prior year, largely driven by improvements in portfolio credit quality.
the net acl build was $160 million, compared to a net release of $426 million in the prior year. the net acl build was primarily driven by a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions.

(1)    investment banking fees are primarily composed of underwriting, advisory, loan syndication structuring and other related financing activity.
(2)    includes revenues earned by citi that are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement with banking-corporate lending for investment banking, markets and services products sold to corporate lending clients.
(3)    credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. gain (loss) on loan hedges includes the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives, partially offset by the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. hedges on accrual loans reflect the mark-to-market on credit derivatives used to economically hedge the corporate loan accrual portfolio. the fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. citigroup's results of operations excluding the impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges is a non-gaap financial measure.
(4)    management uses this information in reviewing the segment's results and believes it is useful to investors concerning underlying segment performance and trends.
(5)    excludes loans that are carried at fair value for all periods.
nm not meaningful the discussion of the results of operations for banking below excludes (where noted) the impact of any gain (loss) on hedges of accrual loans, which are non-gaap financial measures. for a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.
2023 vs. 2022
net loss was $48 million, compared to net income of $386 million in the prior year, primarily driven by lower revenues and higher expenses, partially offset by lower cost of credit.
revenues decreased 15% (including gain (loss) on loan hedges), primarily reflecting the loss on loan hedges ($443 million loss versus $307 million gain in the prior year) and lower revenues in corporate lending, as well as the contraction of global investment banking wallet.
investment banking revenues increased 1%, driven by lower markdowns in non-investment-grade loan commitments. the increase in revenue was mainly offset by the overall decline in market wallet, as heightened macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity. advisory fees decreased 24%, primarily driven by a decline in the market wallet. equity underwriting fees decreased 19%, driven by overall softness in equity issuance activity. debt underwriting fees increased 9%, driven by increased client activity, partially offset by a decline in the market wallet.
corporate lending revenues decreased 30%, including the impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges. excluding the impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges, revenues decreased 4%, largely driven by lower volumes on continued balance sheet optimization. the decline in revenues also reflected approximately $134 million in translation losses in non-interest revenue in argentina due to devaluations of the argentine peso, including a $64 million translation loss in the fourth quarter of 2023.
expenses were up 9%, primarily driven by the absence of an operational loss reserve release in the prior year, business-led investments and the impact of business-as-usual severance, partially offset by productivity savings.
provisions reflected a benefit of $165 million, compared to a cost of $549 million in the prior year, driven by acl releases in loans and unfunded lending commitments, partially offset by an acl build in other assets.
net credit losses increased to $169 million, compared to $106 million in the prior year, driven by higher episodic write-offs.
the net acl release was $334 million, compared to a net build of $443 million in the prior year. the acl releases in loans and unfunded lending commitments were driven by an improved macroeconomic outlook. these releases were partially offset by an acl build in other assets, primarily related to transfer risk associated with exposures in argentina and russia, driven by safety and soundness considerations under u.s. banking law. for additional information on citi's acl, see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates" below.

2022 vs. 2021
net income of $386 million decreased 91%, primarily driven by lower revenues and higher cost of credit.
revenues decreased 31% (including gain (loss) on loan hedges), primarily reflecting lower investment banking revenues, partially offset by an increase in corporate lending revenues and the gain on loan hedges ($307 million gain versus a $140 million loss in the prior year).
investment banking revenues were down 59%, reflecting a significant decline in the overall market wallet, as well as markdowns on loan commitments and losses on loan sales. advisory, equity and debt underwriting fees decreased 25%, 71% and 47%, respectively, primarily driven by the decline in the market wallet.
corporate lending revenues increased 70%, including the impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges. excluding the impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges, revenues increased 41%, primarily driven by higher revenue share from investment banking, services and markets, partially offset by lower volumes and higher hedging costs.
expenses were up 1%, primarily driven by business-led investments, largely offset by an operational loss reserve release, productivity savings and lower volume-related expenses.
provisions were $549 million, compared to a benefit of $1.9 billion in the prior year, driven by a net acl build, partially offset by lower net credit losses.
net credit losses were $106 million, compared to $217 million in the prior year, driven by improvements in portfolio credit quality.
the net acl build was $443 million, compared to a net release of $2.1 billion in the prior year. the net acl build was primarily driven by a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions.

2023 vs. 2022
net income was $1.8 billion, compared to $2.8 billion in the prior year, reflecting higher cost of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.
revenues increased 14%, due to higher net interest income (up 12%), driven by strong loan growth and higher deposit spreads, as well as higher non-interest revenue (up 19%). the increase in non-interest revenue was largely driven by lower partner payments in retail services, due to higher net credit losses, and an increase in interchange fees, driven by higher card spend volumes in branded cards. the increase in non-interest revenue was partially offset by an increase in rewards costs in branded cards, driven by the higher card spend volumes.
cards revenues increased 15%. branded cards revenues increased 11%, primarily driven by the higher net interest income, reflecting the strong loan growth. branded cards new account acquisitions increased 9% and card spend volumes increased 5%. branded cards average loans increased 13%, reflecting the higher card spend volumes and lower card payment rates.
retail services revenues increased 21%, primarily driven by higher net interest income on higher loan balances, as well as higher non-interest revenue due to the lower partner payments, driven by the higher net credit losses (see note 5). retail services credit card spend volumes decreased 4% and average loans increased 9%, largely reflecting lower card payment rates.
retail banking revenues increased 6%, primarily driven by higher deposit spreads and mortgage loan growth, partially offset by the impact of the transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposit balances to wealth. average mortgage loans increased 16%, primarily driven by lower refinancings due to high interest rates and higher mortgage originations. average deposits decreased 4%, largely reflecting the transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposit balances to wealth.
expenses increased 3%, primarily driven by continued investments in other risk and controls, technology, business-led investments and business-as-usual severance costs, partially offset by productivity savings.
provisions were $6.7 billion, compared to $3.4 billion in the prior year, largely driven by higher net credit losses and a higher acl build for loans. net credit losses increased 79%, primarily reflecting higher losses in cards in line with expectations, with branded cards net credit losses up 93% to $2.7 billion and retail services net credit losses up 84% to $2.3 billion. both branded cards and retail services net credit losses reached pre-pandemic levels at the end of 2023.
the net acl build was $1.5 billion, compared to $0.5 billion in the prior year, primarily reflecting growth in loan balances in branded cards and retail services. for additional information on citi's acl, see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates" below.

2022 vs. 2021
net income was $2.8 billion, compared to $6.1 billion in the prior year, reflecting higher cost of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.
revenues increased 6%, primarily due to higher net interest income (up 11%), driven by strong loan growth in branded cards and retail services and the impact of higher interest rates in retail banking. the increase in revenues was partially offset by lower non-interest revenue, largely reflecting higher partner payments in retail services resulting from higher revenues.
cards revenues increased 8%. branded cards revenues increased 9%, primarily driven by higher net interest income on higher loan balances. branded cards new account acquisitions increased 11% and card spend volumes increased 16%. average loans increased 11%, reflecting the higher card spend volumes.
retail services revenues increased 7%, primarily driven by higher net interest income on higher loan balances and lower card payment rates, partially offset by the increase in partner payments. the increase in partner payments reflected higher income sharing as a result of higher revenues. retail services card spend volumes increased 8% and average loans increased 6%, reflecting the higher card spend volumes.
retail banking revenues decreased 2%, as the higher interest rates and modest deposit growth were more than offset by lower mortgage revenues due to fewer mortgage originations, driven by the higher interest rates. average deposits increased 3%, largely reflecting higher levels of consumer liquidity in the first half of 2022.
expenses increased 10%, primarily driven by continued investments in citi's transformation, other risk and control initiatives, volume-related expenses and business-led investments, partially offset by productivity savings.
provisions were $3.4 billion, compared to a benefit of $1.0 billion in the prior year, largely driven by a net acl build. net credit losses decreased 1%, driven by historically low loss rates experienced in the first half of 2022, partially offset by higher losses in the second half of the year, particularly in retail services (net credit losses up 7% to $1.3 billion). branded cards net credit losses declined 17% to $1.4 billion.
the net acl build was $0.5 billion, compared to a net release of $3.9 billion in the prior year, primarily driven by u.s. cards loan growth and a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions.

2023 vs. 2022
net loss was $2.1 billion, compared to net income of $163 million in the prior year, driven by higher expenses (largely related to the fdic special assessment and citi's restructuring charge) and higher cost of credit. the higher expenses and cost of credit were partially offset by higher revenues and the prior-year release of cta losses (net of hedges) from aoci, consisting of approximately $140 million recorded in revenues and approximately $260 million pretax recorded in discontinued operations, related to the substantial liquidation of a u.k. consumer legacy operation (see note 2).
all other (managed basis) revenues increased 4%, driven by higher revenues in corporate/other, partially offset by lower revenues in legacy franchises (managed basis).
legacy franchises (managed basis) revenues decreased 4%, primarily driven by lower revenues in asia consumer (managed basis), partially offset by higher revenues in mexico consumer/sbmm (managed basis).
mexico consumer/sbmm (managed basis) revenues increased 23%, as cards revenues in mexico consumer increased 31%, sbmm revenues increased 28% and retail banking revenues increased 19%, mainly due to the benefit of fx translation as well as higher interest rates and higher deposit and loan growth.
asia consumer (managed basis) revenues decreased 48%, primarily driven by the reduction from exited markets and wind-downs.
corporate/other revenues were $2.2 billion, compared to $1.5 billion in the prior year, driven by higher net interest income. the higher net interest income was primarily due to higher interest rates on deposits with banks and the investment portfolio, partially offset by higher cost of funds.
expenses increased 22%, primarily driven by the $1.7 billion fdic special assessment related to regional bank failures, restructuring charges and higher business-as-usual severance costs, partially offset by lower consulting expenses and lower expenses in both wind-down and exit markets. the restructuring charges were recorded in the fourth quarter and primarily consisted of severance costs associated with headcount reductions related to the organizational simplification initiatives (see note 9).
provisions were $1.3 billion, compared to $498 million in the prior year, driven by a higher net acl build for loans and other assets and higher net credit losses. net credit losses increased 13%, primarily driven by higher lending volumes in mexico consumer.
the net acl build for loans was $106 million, compared to a net release of $368 million in the prior year, primarily driven by higher lending volumes in mexico consumer. the net acl build in other assets was primarily due to the reserve build for transfer risk associated with exposures in russia, driven by safety and soundness considerations under u.s. banking law. for additional information on citi's acl, see "significant accounting policies and significant estimates" below.
for additional information about trends, uncertainties and risks related to all other's (managed basis) future results, see "executive summary" above and "risk factors" and "managing global risk-other risks-country risk-russia" below.
2022 vs. 2021
net income was $163 million, compared to net income of $1.0 billion in the prior year, primarily driven by lower revenues, higher cost of credit and the release of the cta losses (net of hedges) from aoci.
all other (managed basis) revenues decreased 5%, driven by lower revenues in legacy franchises (managed basis), and lower non-interest revenue in corporate/other, partially offset by higher net interest income in corporate/other.
legacy franchises (managed basis) revenues decreased 14%, primarily driven by lower revenues in asia consumer (managed basis) and legacy holdings assets, partially offset by higher revenues in mexico consumer/sbmm (managed basis).
mexico consumer/sbmm (managed basis) revenues increased 2%, as cards revenues in mexico consumer increased 6% and sbmm revenues increased 10%, primarily due to higher interest rates and higher deposit and loan growth. the increase in revenues was partially offset by a 1% decrease in retail banking revenues, primarily driven by lower fiduciary fees reflecting declines in equity market valuations.
asia consumer (managed basis) revenues decreased 25%, primarily driven by the loss of revenues from the closing of the exit markets and the impacts of the ongoing korea wind-down.
legacy holdings assets revenues of $(81) million decreased from $186 million in the prior year, largely driven by the cta loss (net of hedges) recorded in aoci, as well as the continued wind-down of legacy holdings assets.
corporate/other revenues were $1.5 billion, compared to $825 million in the prior year, driven by higher net interest income, partially offset by lower non-interest revenue. the higher net interest income was primarily due to the investment portfolio driven by higher balances, higher interest rates and lower mortgage-backed securities prepayments, partially offset by higher cost of funds related to higher institutional certificates of deposit. the lower non-interest revenue was primarily due to the absence of mark-to-market gains in the prior year as well as higher hedging costs.
expenses decreased 2%, primarily driven by lower consulting expenses, the impact of certain legal settlements and lower expenses in both wind-down and exit markets.
provisions were $498 million, compared to a benefit of $88 million in the prior year, primarily driven by a lower net acl release, partially offset by lower net credit losses. net credit losses decreased 48%, primarily reflecting improved delinquencies in both asia consumer and mexico consumer.
the net acl release was $368 million, compared to a net acl release of $1.7 billion in the prior year, driven by further improvement in portfolio credit quality.

item 1a.    risk factors.
risk factor summary the following summary highlights some of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. this summary is not complete and the risks summarized below are not the only risks we face. these risks are discussed more fully further below in this section entitled "risk factors" in item 1a. of this report. these risks include, but are not limited to, the following:
•we have a substantial amount of indebtedness that could materially adversely affect, among other things, our financial condition, our ability to return capital to our shareholders, needed investments into our business, and our credit ratings.
•if we are unable to successfully execute the next phase of our strategic transformation, including our portfolio optimization, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
•our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to certain considerations.
•our results of operations may be negatively impacted by the outcome of uncertainties related to legal claims, disputes, investigations and litigation, including the ongoing antitrust and competition investigations and related class actions lawsuits.
•inflationary trends and pricing uncertainty, including in the price of our input costs, such as raw materials, transportation and energy, could adversely affect our business and financial results in the short term and result in uncertainties in the long term.
•supply chain disruptions, geopolitical developments, including the russia-ukraine war, the israel-hamas war and wider middle east developments (including disruptions to the red sea passage or such conflicts spreading further in the relevant regions), or climate-change events (including severe weather events) may adversely affect our suppliers or our procurement of raw materials, and thus may impact our business and financial results.
•our success depends on attracting and retaining talented people within our business and our management team. changes to management, including turnover of our top executives, and significant shortfalls in recruitment, retention or transition of employees or our management team could adversely affect our ability to compete and achieve our strategic goals.

risk factors we routinely encounter and address risks in conducting our business. some of these risks may cause our future results to be different - sometimes materially different - than we presently anticipate. below are material risks we have identified that could adversely affect our business. how we react to material future developments, as well as how our competitors and customers react to those developments, could also affect our future results.
risks related to our business and industry we have a substantial amount of indebtedness that could materially adversely affect, among other things, our financial condition, our ability to return capital to our shareholders, needed investments into our business and our credit ratings.
as of december 31, 2023, our total debt was $10.071 billion. despite our level of indebtedness, we expect to continue to have the ability to borrow additional debt. there may be circumstances in which required payments of principal and/or interest on our debt could adversely affect our cash flows, our operating results or our ability to return capital to our shareholders. in addition, our existing revolving credit facility and term loans are also at variable interest rates, exposing us to potentially material interest rate risk at our current level of indebtedness.
furthermore, our degree of leverage could adversely affect our future credit ratings. if we are unable to maintain or improve our current investment grade rating or improve our leverage, it could adversely affect our future cost of funding, liquidity and access to capital markets. the company does not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of its senior unsecured debt. however, any downgrade in our credit rating may, depending on the extent of such downgrade, negatively impact our ability to raise additional debt capital, our liquidity and capital position, and may increase our cost of borrowing for new capital raises. in addition, our existing revolving credit facility and term loans have pricing grids that are based on credit rating, such that our cost of borrowing may increase as our public debt rating decreases. the pricing grid rates have increased by 0.125% for the duration that financial covenant relief (as described below) is provided.
our revolving credit facility and term loans contain various covenants, limitations and events of default customary for similar facilities for similarly rated borrowers, including the requirement for us to maintain, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a maximum ratio of net debt for borrowed money to credit adjusted ebitda in respect of the previous four fiscal quarters. on september 19, 2023, we entered into further amendments to our revolving credit facility and term loans that extend certain relief with respect to this financial covenant by providing that during the relief period our leverage ratio shall not exceed as of the end of the fiscal quarter (for the period of the four fiscal quarters then ended): (i) 5.25x for any fiscal quarter ending on or before march 31, 2024, (ii) 4.75x for the fiscal quarter ending june 30, 2024, (iii) 4.50x for the fiscal quarter ending september 30, 2024, (iv) 4.25x for any subsequent fiscal quarter ending on or before march 31, 2025, (v) 4.00x for any subsequent fiscal quarter ending on or before september 30, 2025 and (vi) 3.75x for the fiscal quarter ending december 31, 2025. the financial covenant relief provided in these most recent amendments superseded the ratios and step downs set forth in prior amendments to these credit facilities entered into on august 4, 2022 and march 23, 2023.
during the financial covenant relief period, the amendments prohibit us from (i) effecting share repurchases, (ii) declaring and paying dividends in cash on common stock in excess of $0.81 per share per fiscal quarter (for an aggregate amount of $3.24 per fiscal year) and (iii) creating liens to secure debt in excess of the greater of $300 million and 3.65% of consolidated net tangible assets, in each case subject to certain exceptions set forth in the amendments. during the financial covenant relief period, the term loans are subject to a mandatory prepayment provision whereby certain asset sale proceeds must be used to pay down amounts outstanding thereunder. see note 9 for additional information on the amendments to the debt agreements.
our current level of leverage could increase our vulnerability to sustained, adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit our ability to obtain further financing, lead to a reduction or suspension of our dividend payments, decrease our flexibility in responding to or preparing for changes in the industry in which we operate and our ability to pursue certain operational and strategic projects or opportunities, including necessary investments into our business or large acquisitions. our level of indebtedness, as well as a failure to comply with covenants under our debt instruments, could adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition or our ability to return capital to our shareholders and any additional debt modifications, instruments or covenant reliefs may subject us to additional covenants and restrictions.
14
if we are unable to successfully execute the next phase of our strategic transformation, including our portfolio optimization, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
in december 2022, we announced our new strategic and financial vision previewing a refreshed strategic plan and new operating model, which among other things, consists of a renewed growth-focus strategy, enhanced cost & productivity initiatives, a redesigned operating model, a reaffirmation of our commitment to our portfolio optimization initiatives and a plan to evolve our board in line with best-in-class governance standards, as well as certain changes to our executive leadership team. implementing such changes can be complex, costly and time-consuming and may also result in unanticipated issues, such as additional expenses, competitive responses, employee turnover or impact on our commercial relationships. even if such initiatives are implemented successfully, the full benefits may not be realized or may not be realized within the desired timeframe. the failure to meet the challenges involved in implementing our strategic transformation could result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
as a part of our ongoing strategic transformation and our portfolio optimization strategy as discussed above, we continue to evaluate and work towards divestitures or strategic transactions. for instance, during the third quarter of 2022, the second quarter of 2023 and the third quarter of 2023, we completed divestitures of our microbial control business, a portion of the savory solutions business and our flavor specialty ingredients business, respectively. during the third quarter of 2023, we announced that we entered into an agreement for the sale of our cosmetics ingredients business, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. the successful entry into and closing of such transactions is contingent on many factors, including, among other things, the performance of the underlying assets or business as well as the relevant industry dynamics overall, the interest of potential buyers and their ability to finance such transactions (which is also impacted by general economic and financial conditions and market dynamics), requisite regulatory approvals, and related separation activities. divestitures involve separation costs and efforts that may divert management's and employees' attention and also result in stranded costs and dis-synergies for the company. moreover, divestitures often entail post-closing third party agreements, such as supply arrangements (including with "take or pay" provisions), product manufacturing, cross-licensing, transitional, or site services agreements ("ancillary agreements"), that may bind the company for certain periods after closing, during which market or company conditions may change. any failure to enter into, complete or potential delays in closing any such transaction, any failure to mitigate or manage the associated costs of such transactions, or obtain appropriate terms for ancillary agreements, could adversely affect the implementation of our portfolio optimization strategy as well as our financial condition, including our leverage ratio.
our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to certain considerations.
dividends are authorized and determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion and depend upon a number of factors, including:
•cash available for dividends;
•our results of operations and anticipated future results of operations;
•our financial condition, including our current or forecasted future cash flows provided by our operating activities (after deducting anticipated future capital expenditures and other commitments required to carry out our operations and business strategy);
•our operating expenses;
•restrictions in our credit agreement related to the issuance of dividends, including minimum capital requirements; and
•other general and economic conditions or other factors our board of directors deems to be relevant.
we expect to continue to pay dividends to our shareholders; however, our board may reduce, suspend or discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. any reduction in the amount of dividends we pay to shareholders could have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.
our results of operations may be negatively impacted by the outcome of uncertainties related to legal claims, disputes, investigations and litigation, including the ongoing antitrust and competition investigations and related class actions lawsuits.
from time to time we are involved in a number of legal claims, regulatory investigations and litigation, including claims related to intellectual property, product liability, competition and antitrust, environmental matters and indirect taxes. for instance, product liability claims may arise due to the fact that we supply products to the food and beverage, functional food, pharma/nutraceutical and personal care industries. our manufacturing and other facilities may expose us to environmental claims and regulatory investigations and potential fines. in addition, and as further described in our consolidated financial statements, we are subject to antitrust and competition investigations in the united states and europe, as well as class action lawsuits against us and certain of our competitors in the united states and canada, alleging violations of antitrust laws and related claims. we may face additional civil suits in the united states or elsewhere, relating to such alleged conduct. at this
15
time, we are unable to predict or determine the scope, duration, or outcome of these investigations. our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable outcomes in these or other pending or future claims, disputes, investigations or litigation. poor results of operations, liquidity or financial condition-particularly as we work towards implementation of our ongoing strategic transformation and our portfolio optimization strategy-may increase the likelihood of shareholder litigation.
in addition, in light of our product offerings into functional food, nutraceuticals, natural antioxidants or pharmaceutical products, we may also be subject to claims of false or deceptive advertising claims relating to the efficacy, health benefits or other performance attributes of such offerings in the u.s., europe and other foreign jurisdictions in which we offer these types of products. these claims can arise as a result of function claims, health claims, nutrient content claims and other claims that impermissibly suggest such benefits or attributes for certain foods or food components. the cost of defending these claims or our obligations for direct damages and indemnification if we were found liable could adversely affect our results of operations.
our insurance may not be adequate to protect us from potential material expenses related to pending and future claims and our current levels of insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable prices. any of these factors could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.
inflationary trends and pricing uncertainty, including in the price of our input costs, such as raw materials, transportation and energy, could adversely affect our business and financial results in the short term and result in uncertainties in the long term.
the global economy continues to experience high rates of inflation. though inflation appears to be gradually declining in certain parts of the world, inflationary pressure and price uncertainty is expected to continue in 2024. as a result of the broader inflationary environment and supply chain disruptions we have experienced, and may continue to experience, volatility and increases in the price of input costs, such as certain raw materials, transportation and energy costs. we might also suffer from supply disruptions from supplier exits as higher costs may become unaffordable for certain suppliers. in addition, though many central banks have paused monetary policies such as increasing interest rates to counter inflation, rates remain at historical highs and may continue to remain at such levels. these and other monetary policies to counter inflation could negatively affect our borrowing costs and those of our customers and suppliers, as well as exchange rates and other macroeconomic factors.
if we are unable to increase the prices of our products to our customers to offset inflationary cost trends, or if we are unable to achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases, we could fail to meet our cost expectations, and our profits and operating results could be adversely affected. our ability to price our products competitively to timely reflect higher input costs is critical to maintain and grow our sales. increases in prices of our products to customers or the impact of the broader inflationary environment on our customers may continue to lead to declines in demand and sales volumes. further, we may not be able to accurately predict or hedge for price fluctuations of input costs, or predict the volume impact of the price increases in our products, while our competitors may be able to more successfully adjust to such input cost volatility. increasing our prices to our customers could result in long-term sales declines or loss of market share if our customers find alternative suppliers or choose to reformulate their consumer products to rely less on our products, which could have an adverse long-term impact on our results of operations. increased cost volatility trends may also impact the business and financial situation of our customers or suppliers, which could in turn affect the demand or supply, respectively, by such parties. future inflationary and deflationary trends are beyond our control, and we may not be able to sufficiently mitigate any impact on our business and financial situation.
supply chain disruptions, geopolitical developments, including the russia-ukraine war, the israel-hamas war and wider middle east developments (including disruptions to the red sea passage or such conflicts spreading further in the relevant regions), or climate-change events (including severe weather events) may adversely affect our suppliers or our procurement of raw materials, and thus may impact our business and financial results.
in connection with our manufacturing of our products, we often rely on third party suppliers for raw materials. we use many different raw materials for our business, such as essential oils, extracts and concentrates derived from fruits, vegetables, flowers, woods and other botanicals, animal products, raw fruits, organic chemicals and petroleum-based chemicals, as well as, gelatin, glycols, cellulose processed grains, guar, locust bean gum, organic vegetable oils, peels, saccharides, seaweed, soybeans, and sugars and yeasts.
supply chain disruptions, such as the ones related to the covid-19 pandemic, may impair or delay our ability to obtain sufficient quantities of certain raw materials through our ordinary supply channels and cause us to incur higher costs by procuring raw materials from other sources in order to compensate for such delays or lack of availability.
in addition, our suppliers, similar to us, are subject to risks, inherent in agriculture, manufacturing and distribution on a global scale, including industrial accidents, environmental events, climate change, strikes and other labor disputes, disruptions in supply chain or information systems, disruption or loss of key research or manufacturing sites, product quality control, safety and environmental compliance issues, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, as well as natural disasters, global or
16
local health crises, international conflicts, terrorist acts, geopolitical developments, trade wars, and other external factors over which neither they nor we have control. these suppliers could also become insolvent or experience other financial distress.
if our suppliers are unable to supply us with sufficient quantities of ingredients and raw materials to meet our needs, we would need to seek alternative sources of such materials (which may result in higher transportation or procurement costs) or pursue our own production of such ingredients or direct acquisition of such raw materials. however, for certain of our ingredients and raw materials, we rely on a limited number of suppliers where there are not readily available alternatives. if we are unable to obtain or manufacture alternative sources of such ingredients or raw materials at a similar cost, we may seek to (i) reformulate our products and/or (ii) increase pricing to reflect the higher supply cost. to mitigate our sourcing risk, we maintain strategic stock levels for critical items. however, if we do not accurately estimate the amount of raw materials that will be used for the geographic region in which we will need these materials or competitively price our products, our margins could be adversely affected.
geopolitical developments, such as trade wars, the russia-ukraine war, the israel-hamas war and wider middle east developments (including disruptions to the red sea passage or such conflicts spreading further in the relevant regions), could adversely impact, among other things, our raw material, energy and transportation costs, certain of our suppliers, distributors, customers and local markets, global and local macroeconomic conditions, and cause further supply chain disruptions (including by delaying the delivery times of raw materials needed for our business or our products to customers). as the russia-ukraine war has prolonged, it continues to impact our sourcing of certain raw materials for future years, and we continue to look for alternative suppliers or adjust the types of raw materials used in our products. in addition, as the israel-hamas war develops with potential implications for the wider middle east (including the red sea passage), it may have similar impacts on suppliers, customers or local markets.
at the same time, climate-change related disruptions, may affect the availability, quality and pricing of raw materials. there is growing evidence that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather and precipitation patterns, growing and harvesting conditions (both on land and in the sea), and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters, such as floods, wildfires, droughts and water scarcity. to the extent such climate change effects have a negative impact on crop size and quality, supply chain, energy or transportation costs, it could impact the availability, quality and pricing of affected raw materials. climate related policies and energy production restrictions and pricing may exacerbate such negative impacts.
more generally, as we source many of our raw materials globally to help ensure quality control or to mitigate supply chain disruptions, we are subject to additional risks related to the increases in energy or transportation costs. energy prices are in turn subject to significant volatility caused by, among other things, market fluctuations, supply and demand changes, currency fluctuations, production and transportation disruptions, and other world events, as well as geopolitical developments and climate change related conditions discussed above.
if we are not able to successfully mitigate such supply chain and climate-change related risks, we could experience disruptions in production or increased costs, which may result in decrease in our gross margin or reduced sales, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
our success depends on attracting and retaining talented people within our business and our management team. changes to management, including turnover of our top executives, and significant shortfalls in recruitment, retention or transition of employees or our management team could adversely affect our ability to compete and achieve our strategic goals.
attracting, developing, and retaining talented employees is essential to the successful delivery of our products and has become more difficult and costly in the current labor market. furthermore, as we continue to focus on innovation, our need for scientists and other professionals will increase and may result in increased labor costs. the ability to attract and retain talented employees is critical in the development of new products and technologies which is an integral component of our growth strategy.
competition for employees can be intense and if we are unable to successfully integrate, motivate and reward our employees, we may not be able to retain them. if we are unable to retain our employees or attract new employees in the future, our ability to effectively compete with our competitors and to grow our business could be adversely affected. in addition, we have announced, as part of our strategic transformation initiatives, certain headcount reductions to re-align our workforce to match strategic and financial objectives and optimize resources for long-term growth. such reductions could lead to increased uncertainty, attrition or lower morale amongst those employees who are not directly affected by the headcount reductions as those reductions are being implemented, which may result in decreased productivity or could otherwise impact our results of operation.
in addition, the loss of any member of our senior management could materially adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and strategy. we may not find an adequate replacement in a timely fashion, or at all and any replacement may
17
view the business differently than current members of management. future executives may make changes to our strategic focus, operations, business plans or financial guidance and outlook, with corresponding changes in how we report our results of operations. we can make no assurances that we would be able to properly manage any shift in focus or that any changes to our business would ultimately prove successful.
lastly, our success may depend on the ability of our new chief executive officer to integrate and quickly adapt to and understand our business, operations, and strategic plans. this will be critical to the company and our management's ability to make informed decisions about our near-term strategic direction and operations. while our board of directors strives to mitigate the risk through a robust management succession process, which includes the outgoing chief executive officer serving in an advisory role until december 2024, leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage. an inadequate transition may cause disruption to our business due to, among other things, diverting management's attention away from the company's financial and operational goals or causing a deterioration in morale.
if we are unable to successfully market to our expanded and diverse customer base, our operating results and future growth may be adversely affected.
as a result of our acquisition of frutarom and the n&b transaction, the number of our customers significantly increased and became more diverse. our historical customer base was primarily comprised of large and medium-sized food, beverage and consumer products companies. with the completion of the n&b transaction, our customer base has further increased significantly and, based on 2023 sales, we had approximately 27,000 customers, approximately 54% of which are small and mid-sized companies. this substantial increase in and diversity of our customer base has required us and may continue to require us to adjust, among other things, our product development, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, customer relationship and sales strategy as well as adapt corporate, information technology, finance and administrative infrastructures to support different go-to-market models. we may experience difficulty managing the growth of a portfolio of customers that is more diverse in terms of its geographical presence as well as with respect to the types of services they require and the infrastructure required to deliver our products. if we are unable to successfully gain market share or maintain our relationships with these customers, our future growth could be adversely affected.
our business is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively our sales and results of operations will suffer.
the markets in which we compete are highly competitive. we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world, including multi-national and specialized companies active in flavors, fragrances, enzymes, pharmaceutical excipients, nutrition and specialty ingredients, as well as consumer product companies which may develop their own competing products. for instance, in the flavors industry, we face increasing competition from ingredient suppliers that have expanded their portfolios to include flavor offerings. some of our competitors specialize in one or more of our product sub-segments, while others participate in many of our product sub-segments. in addition, some of our global competitors may have more resources than we do or may have proprietary products that could permit them to respond to changing business and economic conditions more effectively than we can. moreover, there has been increased consolidation among our competitors, and such consolidation or partnerships among our competitors may exacerbate these risks.
as we continue to enter into adjacent markets, such as functional foods, specialty fine ingredients and nutrition products, we may face greater competition-related risks in these markets than with our other businesses. for example, the specialty fine ingredients market is more price sensitive than the flavors market and is characterized by relatively lower profit margins. some fine ingredients products are less unique and more replaceable than competitors' products. there is no assurance that operating margins will remain at current levels, which could substantially impact our business, operating results and financial condition.
competition in our business is based, among other things, on innovation, product quality, regulatory compliance, pricing, quality of customer service, the support provided by marketing and application groups, and understanding of consumers. it is difficult for us to predict the timing, scale and success of our competitors' actions in these areas. in particular, the discovery and development of new products, protection of our intellectual property and development and retention of key employees are critical to our ability to effectively compete in our business. advancement in technologies have also enhanced the ability of our competitors to develop substitutable products. increased competition by existing or future competitors, including aggressive price competition, could result in the loss of sales, reduced pricing and margin pressure and could adversely impact our sales and profitability.
failing to identify and make capital expenditures to achieve growth opportunities, being unable to make new concepts scalable, or failing to effectively and timely reinvest in our business operations, could result in the loss of competitive position and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
a significant portion of our sales is generated from a limited number of large multi-national customers, which are currently under competitive pressures that may affect the demand for our products and profitability.
18
during 2023, our 25 largest customers, a majority of which were multi-national consumer products companies, collectively accounted for approximately 32% of our sales in the aggregate. large multi-national customers' market share, especially in the consumer product industry, continues to be pressured by new smaller companies and specialty players that cater to or are more adept at adjusting to the latest consumer trends, including towards natural products and clean labels, changes in the retail landscape (including e-commerce and consolidation), and increased competition from private labels, which have resulted and may continue to result in decreased demand for our products by such multi-national customers and volume erosion, especially in our nourish business. furthermore, consolidations amongst our customers have resulted in larger and more sophisticated customers with greater buying power and additional negotiating strength. if such trends continue, our sales could be adversely impacted if we are not able to replace these sales.
in addition, large multi-national customers and increasingly middle market customers continue to utilize "core lists" of suppliers to improve margins and profitability in the flavors and fragrance segments. typically, these "core list" suppliers are then given priority for new or modified products. recently, these customers are making inclusion on their "core lists" contingent upon a supplier providing more favorable terms, including rebates, which could adversely affect our margins. we must either offer competitive cost-in-use solutions to secure and maintain inclusion on these "core lists" or seek to manage the relationship without being on the "core-list." if we choose not to pursue "core-list" status due to profitability concerns or if we are unable to obtain "core-list" status, our ability to maintain our share of these customers' future purchases could be adversely affected and therefore our future results of operations.
we may not successfully develop and introduce new products that meet our customers' needs, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
our ability to differentiate ourselves and deliver growth largely depends on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and product improvements that meet our customers' needs, and ultimately appeal to consumers. innovation is a key element of our ability to develop and introduce new products. we cannot be certain that we will be successful in achieving our innovation goals, such as the development of new molecules, new and expanded delivery systems and other technologies. in 2023, we spent approximately 5.5% of our sales on research and development, and as part of our new strategic vision announced in december 2022, we expect to continue investment in research and development and innovation initiatives. this investment level may vary in the future if available resources to invest in research and development are limited due to our ongoing integration and restructuring efforts or from adverse macroeconomic or supply chain factors. we also may need to devote more resources to enhancing our existing product portfolios. our research and development investments may only generate future revenues to the extent that we are able to develop products that meet our customers' specifications, are at an acceptable cost and achieve acceptance by the targeted consumer market. furthermore, there may be significant lag times from the time we incur research and development costs to the time that these research and development costs may result in increased revenue.
consequently, even when we "win" a project, our ability to generate revenues as a result of these investments is subject to numerous customer, economic and other risks that are outside of our control, including delays by our customers in the launch of a new product, the level of promotional support for the launch, poor performance of our third-party vendors, anticipated sales by our customers not being realized or changes in market preferences or demands, or disruptive innovations by competitors.
international conflicts (such as the russia-ukraine war and israel-hamas war), geopolitical events, natural disasters, public health crises (such as the covid-19 pandemic), trade wars, terrorist acts, labor strikes, political or economic crises (such as uncertainty related to protracted u.s. federal government funding negotiations), accidents and other events could adversely affect our business and financial results, including by disrupting development, manufacturing, distribution or sale of our products.
as a company engaged in the global development, manufacture and distribution of products, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes, product quality control issues, safety, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, as well as natural disasters, public health crises, such as pandemics or epidemics, international conflicts, geopolitical events, trade wars, terrorist acts, political or economic crises (such as the uncertainty related to protracted u.s. federal government funding negotiations) and other external factors over which we have no control. see, also "-supply chain disruptions, geopolitical developments, including the russia-ukraine war, the israel-hamas war and wider middle east developments (including disruptions to the red sea passage), or climate-change events (including severe weather events) may adversely affect our suppliers or our procurement of raw materials, and thus may impact our business and financial results." for instance, the russia-ukraine war has adversely impacted and may continue to impact, among other things, certain of our local markets and suppliers, global and local macroeconomic conditions, foreign exchange rates and financial markets, raw material, energy and transportation costs, and cause further supply chain disruptions. we maintain operations in both russia and ukraine and export products to customers in russia and ukraine from operations outside the region. in response to the events in ukraine, the company has limited the production and supply of ingredients in and to russia to only those that meet the essential needs of people, including food, hygiene and medicine. as a result of changes and uncertainties arising out of the russia-ukraine war, our operating performance in russia remains lower compared
19
to previous years and may not reverse in the near future. the israel-hamas war may also have impacts on our operations in israel and certain of our customers, local markets and suppliers.
while we operate research and development, manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the world, many of these facilities are extremely specialized and certain of our research and development or creative laboratories facilities are uniquely situated to support our research and development efforts while certain of our manufacturing facilities are the sole location where a specific ingredient or product is produced. if our research and development activities or the manufacturing of ingredients or products were disrupted, the cost of relocating or replacing these activities or reformulating these ingredients or products may be substantial, which could result in production or development delays or otherwise have an adverse effect on our margins, operating results and future growth.
moreover, as a result of the covid-19 pandemic's impact on the global supply chain, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, increased costs, delays or limited availability related to raw materials, strain on shipping and transportation resources, and higher energy prices, which have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact, our margins and operating results. although we do not currently anticipate any impairment charges related to covid-19, the continuing effects of the pandemic could result in increased risks to us of asset write-downs and impairments, including, but not limited to, property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangibles, and equity investments. any of these events or factors could potentially result in a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
a significant data breach or other disruption to our information technology systems could disrupt our operations, result in the loss of confidential information or personal data, and adversely impact our reputation, business or results of operations.
we rely on information technology systems, including some managed by third-party providers, to conduct business and to support our business processes, including those relating to product formulas, product development, manufacturing, sales, order and invoice processing, production, distribution, internal communications and communications with third parties throughout the world, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory (including sec), tax or legal requirements, and collecting and storing customer, supplier, employee and other stakeholder information.
to address the risks to our information technology systems and the associated costs, we maintain an information security program that includes updating technology and information security policies and controls, cybersecurity insurance, cybersecurity governance and compliance, employee/consultant awareness training, table-top exercises, logging and monitoring and routine testing of our information technology systems. we believe that these preventative actions provide adequate measures of protection against information security breaches/incidents and generally reduce our cybersecurity risks, however, cybersecurity incidents, data breaches and operational disruptions are constantly evolving, becoming more sophisticated, including through the increasing use of ai, and conducted by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives, including foreign governments, cyber terrorists, cyber criminals, malicious employees and other insiders and outsiders. additionally, continued geopolitical turmoil, including the ongoing conflicts in the middle east and between russia and ukraine, heightened the risk of cyber incidents. we and our third-party providers are subject to the risks posed by such incidents, which can take many forms, including code anomalies, "acts of god," data leakage, hardware or software failures, human errors, cyber extortion, password theft or introduction of viruses, malware and ransomware, including through phishing emails.
a disruption to our information technology systems could result in the loss of confidential business, customer, supplier or employee information, litigation or fines, and may require substantial investigations, repairs or replacements or impact our ability to summarize and report financial results in a timely manner, resulting in significant financial, legal and relational costs and potentially harming our reputation and adversely impacting our operations, customer service and results of operations. additionally, the increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing and ai, may lead to potential loss or unauthorized disclosure or use of personal data and proprietary information that was collected, used, stored, or transferred with respect to our business, and to dissemination or destruction of confidential information, unintentionally or otherwise, stored in our or in our third party providers' systems or through use of ai, which may significantly increase our business and information security costs, and expose us to reputational harm, penalties, or legal liability. as we complete integration of systems of prior acquired companies with iff's systems and prepare for the announced divestitures, we reduce our risk profile. additionally, an information security or data breach could require us to devote significant management and financial resources to address the problems created, and, as a result of the private rights of action provided for under the european union's general data protection regulation (the "gdpr"), the california consumer privacy act (the "ccpa") and other laws relating to data protection and privacy in other jurisdictions, in the event of such breaches, additional private litigation against us may result. these types of adverse impacts could also occur in the event the confidentiality, integrity or availability of company, customer, supplier or employee information are compromised due to a data loss by us or a trusted third party. we or the third parties with which we share information may not discover any such incidents and/or loss of information for a significant period of time after the incident occurs. in addition, our hybrid and remote work arrangements could introduce operational risk, including cybersecurity and it systems management risks.
20
we have experienced threats to our data and our systems and although we have not experienced a material incident to date, there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent or limit the impact of a future incident. additionally, while we have insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks in place, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.
we are subject to risks associated with the potential use of ai in our own operations and by third-party partners that we may engage with.
recent technological advances in ai come with significant risks related to its use across many industries, including our own. iff may be exposed to such risks in cases where iff utilizes ai in connection with certain business activities now or in the future, in cases where, whether known or unknown to iff, iff personnel, use ai for our business or at iff locations, or in cases where our third-party partners, whether or not known to iff, use ai in their business activities (which we may not be in a position to control).
the use of ai by us, our employees or any of our third-party partners may result in unauthorized disclosure of personal data, proprietary information and trade secrets, commercially sensitive or confidential information of iff, our employees or our partners. similarly, we may become, through the use of ai and unbeknownst to us, recipients or users of such information provided by other parties, which may enable, among other things, third parties to claim that we infringed on their intellectual property rights. such unauthorized disclosures or uses of information can result, among other things, in reputational harm, loss of confidence by our customers or employees, penalties, litigation costs, or legal liability.
analyses, results or business processes relying on ai may also be deficient, inaccurate, or biased and we may fail to identify in a timely fashion or at all, if or to the extent that is the case. furthermore, ai can exacerbate our cybersecurity or it risks. see "--a significant data breach or other disruption to our information technology systems could disrupt our operations, result in the loss of confidential information or personal data, and adversely impact our reputation, business or results of operations." with new and evolving ai comes a continually changing ai regulatory environment, which may create additional compliance costs and risks. at the same time, ai has the potential to significantly change the way we do our business by, among other things, creating efficiencies, improving our processes, customer experience, talent management and our decision-making. any failure to capitalize on the ai benefits to the same degree or with the same speed as our competitors may put us in a disadvantageous position.
if we are unable to successfully manage these risks, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
we have made investments in and continue to expand our business into emerging markets, which exposes us to certain risks.
as part of our growth strategy, we have increased our presence in emerging markets by expanding our manufacturing presence, sales organization and product offerings in these markets, and we expect to continue to expand our business in these markets as part of our new strategic vision announced in december 2022. with our acquisition of frutarom in 2018 and the n&b transaction, each of which also had a significant presence in emerging markets, our business in these markets has meaningfully grown. in addition to the currency and international risks described below, our operations in these markets may be subject to a variety of other risks. emerging markets typically have a consumer base with limited or fluctuating disposable income and customer demand in these markets may fluctuate accordingly. as a result, a decrease in customer demand in emerging markets may have an adverse effect on our ability to execute our growth strategy.
further, there is no assurance that our existing products, variants of our existing products or new products that we make, manufacture, distribute or sell will be accepted or be successful in any particular developing or emerging market, due to local or global competition, product price, cultural differences, consumer preferences or otherwise. in addition, emerging markets may have weak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights, exchange controls, unstable governments and privatization or other government actions that may affect taxes, subsidies and incentive programs and the flow of goods and currency. in conducting our business, we move products from one country to another and may provide services in one country from a subsidiary located in another country. accordingly, we are vulnerable to abrupt changes in trade, customs and tax regimes in these markets. if we are unable to expand our business in developing and emerging markets, effectively operate, or manage the risks associated with operating in these markets, or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these markets, our operating results and future growth could be adversely affected.
the impact of currency fluctuation or devaluation in the international markets in which we operate may negatively affect our results of operations.
21
we have significant operations outside the u.s., the results of which are reported in the local currency and then translated into u.s. dollars at applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. the exchange rates between these currencies and the u.s. dollar have fluctuated and will continue to do so in the future, with the fluctuations being particularly pronounced in certain emerging markets. changes in exchange rates between these local currencies and the u.s. dollar will affect the recorded levels of sales, profitability, assets and/or liabilities. along with other macroeconomic uncertainty we are experiencing such as a highly inflationary global environment and supply chain disruptions discussed elsewhere in these risk factors, we have experienced and continue to expect volatility in global foreign currency exchange rates. changes to interest rate policy as managed by the federal reserve bank to counter inflationary trends may further impact such exchange rates. further volatility or unfavorable movements in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our financial condition, cash flows or liquidity. although we employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, including sourcing strategies and a limited number of foreign currency hedging activities, we cannot guarantee that such hedging and risk management strategies will be effective, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.
international economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements, operations and growth.
we operate on a global basis, with manufacturing and sales facilities in or supply arrangements with companies based in the u.s., europe, africa, the middle east, latin america, and greater asia. during 2023, approximately 72% of our combined net sales were to customers outside the u.s. and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations. as a result, our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in international operations. these risks, which can vary substantially by location, include the following:
•governmental laws, regulations and policies adopted to manage national economic and macroeconomic conditions, such as increases in taxes, austerity measures that may impact consumer spending, monetary policies that may impact inflation rates, employment regulations, currency fluctuations or controls and sustainability of resources;
•changes in environmental, health and safety permits or regulations, such as regulations related to biodiversity or the continued implementation and evolution of the european union's reach regulations and similar regulations that are being evaluated and adopted in other markets, or the ban on microplastics recently adopted by the european commission ("ec") and the burdens and costs of our compliance with such regulations which may differ significantly across jurisdictions;
•increased product labeling and ingredient prohibitions in specific markets that may impact consumer preferences, products costs and/or customer acceptance;
•the imposition of or changes in customs, tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, other trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, and sanctions on trade with certain countries, imposed by the u.s. or other countries, which could adversely affect our cost or ability to import raw materials or export our products to surrounding markets;
•risks and costs arising from our ability to cater to local demand and customer preferences, language and cultural differences;
•the movement for increased unionization in the u.s. and internationally may lead to labor instability, employee turnover, increased labor costs or production and operation disruptions;
•changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in the countries in which we operate, including the risk of expropriation or nationalization, the costs and ability to repatriate the profit that we generate in these countries;
•risks and costs associated with complying with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws;
•risks and costs associated with complying with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, similar u.s. or foreign anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations, applicable sanctions laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate or ethical business practices and related laws and regulations;
•risks and costs associated with political and economic instability, bribery and corruption, anti-american sentiment, and social and ethnic unrest in the countries in which we operate;
•difficulty in recruiting and retaining trained local personnel;
•natural disasters, global or local health crisis, pandemics (such as the covid-19 pandemic), epidemics or international conflicts (such as the russia-ukraine war and israel-hamas war) or geopolitical tension (such as deteriorating u.s.-china relations), including terrorist acts, political crisis, national and regional labor strikes in the countries in which we operate, which could endanger our personnel, interrupt our operations or adversely affect the demand for our products, the results of certain regions or our global supply chain; or
•the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation, application and enforceability of laws and regulations and the enforceability of contract rights and intellectual property rights.
the occurrence of any one or more of these factors could increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations.
22
economic uncertainty, including increased inflation, may adversely affect demand for our products which may have a negative impact on our operating results and future growth.
many of our products are ingredients in a wide assortment of global consumer products throughout the world. historically, demand for consumer products using our products, was stimulated and broadened by changing social habits and consumer needs, population growth, an expanding global middle-class and general economic growth, especially in emerging markets.
changes in the global, regional or local economic conditions have, and may in the near future, adversely impact demand for consumer products at a regional or global level. such parameters include, but are not limited to, increased inflation, unemployment and underemployment, salaries and wage rates stagnation, low growth rates, and ongoing impacts of the covid-19 pandemic. reduced consumer spending may cause changes in our customer orders including reduced demand for our products or order cancellations. the timing of placing of orders and the amounts of these orders are generally at our customers' discretion. customers may cancel, reduce or postpone orders with us on relatively short notice. significant cancellations, reductions or delays in orders by customers could affect our results of operation.
the integration of the n&b business may continue to present significant challenges, and we may not realize anticipated synergies and other benefits of the n&b transaction.
the combination of large, diverse and independent businesses is complex, costly and time-consuming. the combination with the n&b business may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, employee turnover and loss of customer and other business relationships. in addition, even though the operations of the n&b business are being integrated, the full benefits of the transaction may not be realized, including, among others, the synergies, cost savings or revenue growth that are expected. these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all, which could result in a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
if we are unable to react in a timely and cost-effective manner to changes in consumer trends, such as increasing awareness of health and wellness our results of operations and future growth may be adversely affected.
we must continually anticipate and react, in a timely and cost-effective manner, to changes in consumer preferences and demands, including changes in demand driven by increasing awareness of health and wellness, demands for transparency or cleaner labels with respect to product ingredients by consumers and regulators, and attitudes towards the impact of biotechnology advances such as gene editing and mapping. consumers, especially in developed economies such as the u.s. and western europe, are rapidly shifting away from products containing artificial ingredients to all-natural, healthier alternatives, and the development of certain new weight management pharmaceutical products such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (glp-1) receptor agonists may affect consumer behavior and trends, and ultimately decrease demand for our product offerings. in addition, there has been a growing demand by consumers, non-governmental organizations and, to a lesser extent, governmental agencies to provide more transparency in product labeling and our customers have been taking steps to address this demand, including by voluntarily providing product-specific ingredients disclosure. these trends could affect the types and volumes of our ingredients and compounds that our customers include in their consumer product offerings and, therefore, affect the demand for our products. if we are unable to react to or anticipate these trends in a timely and cost-effective manner, our results of operations and future growth may be adversely affected.
we are subject to increasing customer, consumer, shareholder and regulatory focus on sustainability, which may result in additional costs in order to meet new requirements.
federal, state, local and foreign governments, our customers, consumers and shareholders are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental and other sustainability issues. in response, we have committed to a sustainability strategy to better understand the opportunities and risks in our sustainable efforts.
the increased focus on sustainability may result in new regulations and customer requirements that could affect us. these could cause us to incur additional direct costs or to make changes to our operations in order to comply with any new regulations and customer requirements. we could also lose revenue if our customers divert business from us because we have not complied with their sustainability requirements. increased shareholder activism with respect to sustainability or other governance issues or management concerns could also lead to increased costs and disruption to operations. these potential costs, changes and loss of revenue could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
23
our performance may be adversely impacted if we are not successful in managing our inventory and/or working capital balances.
we evaluate our inventory balances of materials based on shelf life, expected sourcing levels, known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in our product/sales mix. efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success, financial returns and profitability. to be successful, we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate product/sales mix to meet our customers' demands, without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs associated with storing and holding other inventory adversely impact our financial results. if our buying decisions do not accurately predict sourcing levels, customer trends or our expectations about customer needs are inaccurate, we may have to take unanticipated markdowns or charges to dispose of the excess or obsolete inventory, which can adversely impact our financial results. current supply-chain related issues could also lead to raw material shortages and inventory depletion, which may adversely affect our operations. see "-supply chain disruptions, geopolitical developments, including the russia-ukraine war, the israel-hamas war and wider middle east developments (including disruptions to the red sea passage), or climate-change events (including severe weather events) may adversely affect our suppliers or our procurement of raw materials, and thus may impact our business and financial results." additionally, we believe excess inventory levels of raw materials with a short shelf life in our manufacturing facilities subjects us to the risk of increased inventory shrinkage. if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances and shrinkage, our results of and cash flows from operations may be negatively affected.
we sell certain accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to unrelated financial institutions under "factoring" agreements, some of which are sponsored by certain customers. the cost of participating in these programs was immaterial to our results in all periods. should we choose not to participate, or if these programs were no longer available, it could reduce our cash flows from operations in the period in which the arrangement ends.
any impairment of our tangible or intangible long-lived assets, including goodwill, may adversely impact our profitability.
a significant portion of our assets consists of long-lived assets, including tangible assets such as our manufacturing facilities, and intangible assets, including goodwill and customer relationships.
as a result of our recent acquisitions, including the acquisition of frutarom and the n&b transaction, as of december 31, 2023, we recorded approximately $18.992 billion of intangible assets and goodwill, including $4.289 billion of goodwill associated with the acquisition of frutarom and $11.817 billion of goodwill associated with the merger with the n&b business, prior to the impact of impairment charges and business divestitures. our results of operations and financial position in future periods could be negatively impacted should future impairments of our long-lived assets, including intangible assets or goodwill occur.
at least annually, we assess both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. we test for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we record an impairment charge based on the difference of the two. intangible assets with finite lives are also tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. such events and changes in circumstances could include a sustained decrease in our market capitalization, increased competition or unexpected loss of market share, increased input costs beyond projections (for example due to regulatory or industry changes), our inability to recognize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, unexpected business disruptions (for example due to a natural disaster, public health crises, such as pandemics or epidemics or loss of a customer, supplier, or other significant business relationship), acts by governments and courts, operating results falling short of projections, or significant adverse changes in the markets in which we operate. during the year ended december 31, 2023, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $2.623 billion in the consolidated statements of (loss) income and comprehensive loss. refer to part ii, item 7 and note 1 and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates and market factors. estimating the fair value of reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our business performance, future plans, future annual net cash flows, income tax considerations, discount rates and growth rates based on industry, economic, regulatory conditions and other market factors. moreover, management will make significant accounting judgments and estimates for the application of acquisition accounting under gaap, and the underlying valuation models. iff's business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods if iff's accounting judgments and estimates related to these models prove to be inaccurate.
to the extent any of our acquisitions, including the acquisitions of frutarom and the n&b business, do not perform as anticipated and our underlying assumptions and estimates related to their fair value determination are not met, whether due to internal or external factors, the value of goodwill and other long-lived assets may be negatively affected and we may be required to record impairment charges.
24
if we fail to successfully enter into or close collaborations, joint ventures, partnerships or acquisitions, or successfully manage such transactions, it could adversely affect our business and growth opportunities.
from time to time, we evaluate and enter into collaborations, joint ventures or partnerships to enhance our research and development efforts, expand our product portfolios and technology, or modify or enter into new distribution arrangements. the process of establishing and maintaining such relationships is difficult and time-consuming to negotiate, document and implement. we may not be able to successfully negotiate such arrangements or the terms of the arrangements may not be as favorable as anticipated. furthermore, our ability to generate revenues from such collaborations will depend on our partners' abilities and efforts to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements and these collaborations may not lead to development or commercialization of products in the most efficient manner, or at all. in addition, from time to time, we have acquired, and we may acquire, only a majority interest in companies and provided or may provide earnouts for the former owners along with the ability, at our option, or obligation, at the former owners' option, to purchase the minority interests at a future date at an established price. these investments may have additional risks and may not be as efficient as other operations as we may have fiduciary or contractual obligations to the minority investors and may rely on former owners for the continuing operation of the acquired business. if we are unable to successfully establish and manage these collaborative relationships and majority investments, it could adversely affect our future growth.
in addition, from time to time, we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business and/or growth objectives. if we are unable to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses, we could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings, including any expected increase in revenues and operating results, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. furthermore, even if successfully integrated, the acquisition target may fail to further the company's business strategy as anticipated, expose the company to increased competition or other challenges with respect to the company's products or geographic markets, and expose the company to additional liabilities associated with the acquired business, technology or other asset or arrangement. we may also incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions if we fail to maintain and integrate the acquired businesses and such impairments charges would reduce our earnings.
our funding obligations for our pension and postretirement plans could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.
the funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets, particularly the equity markets and interest rates. funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date. if the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations, we could be required to make larger contributions. the equity markets can be very volatile, and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time. similarly, changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements. an adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our required contributions in the future and adversely impact our liquidity.
assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined by us in consultation with outside consultants and advisors. in the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on assets, or expected health care costs, our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease. due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population, the assumptions that we use may differ from actual results, which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements.
the phase out of the london interbank offered rate ("libor") may impact the interest rates paid on our variable rate indebtedness and could cause our interest expense to increase.
after consultations among financial regulators in the united states and europe, the secured overnight financing rate ("sofr") was identified as the replacement rate for libor, which ceased publication in june 2023. sofr is observed and backward-looking, which stands in contrast with libor's methodology, which was an estimated forward-looking rate and relied, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. given that sofr is a secured rate backed by government securities, it is a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk (as was the case with libor). sofr is a relatively new reference rate with a limited history and so it is difficult to predict its future performance. as such, the transition from libor to sofr may pose future uncertainties and challenges.
borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loans are at variable interest rates and have been amended to be based on sofr. no assurance can be made that such alternative rate will perform in a manner similar to libor and may result in interest rates that are higher or lower than those that would have resulted had libor remained in effect. any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our borrowing costs, financial condition and results of operations.
25
risks related to legal and regulatory considerations if we are unable to comply with regulatory requirements and industry standards, including those regarding product safety, quality, efficacy and environmental impact, we could incur significant costs and suffer reputational harm which could adversely affect results of operations.
the development, manufacture and sale of our products are subject to various regulatory requirements in each of the countries in which our products are developed, manufactured and sold. in addition, we are subject to product safety and compliance requirements established by governments, non-governmental organizations, including industry or similar oversight bodies, or contractually by our customers, including requirements concerning product safety, quality and efficacy, environmental impacts (including packaging, energy and water use and waste management) and other sustainability or similar issues. changes to regulations or the implementation of additional regulations, especially in certain highly regulated markets we are active in, such as regulatory modernization of food safety laws and evolving standards and regulations affecting pharmaceutical excipients or in reaction to new or next-generation technologies, including advances in protein engineering, biotechnology (e.g., gene editing and gene mapping), novel uses of existing technologies or stricter rules on ingredients produced by biotechnology techniques have required and may in the future require us to reduce or remove certain ingredients, substances or processing aids from the product portfolio and may result in significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced margins or profitability.
as concerns regarding safety, quality and environmental impact become more pressing, we may see new, more restrictive regulations adopted that impact our products. for example, the ec recently adopted a ban on microplastics, including those found in personal care items, detergents and cosmetics, to reduce plastics pollution. we are now required to modify our products and/or innovate new solutions to replace microplastics in our products. the eu green deal includes a chemicals strategy for sustainability (css), which will trigger updates of the main regulations governing chemical substances used in household and cosmetic products or in industrial applications (reach, clp, cosmetic regulation and detergent regulation). this strategy aims for an expansion of the generic risk management approach based on hazard rather than risk and will introduce other concepts like grouping of similar substances to accelerate regulatory decision making. the practical implementation of this strategy may negatively impact some of the products we place on the market, including some enzymes or fragrance ingredients. if we are unable to adapt to these new regulations or standards in a cost effective and timely manner, we may lose business to competitors who are able to provide compliant products, expose ourselves to customer claims, regulatory fines, litigation or reputational damage.
gaps in our operational processes or those of our suppliers or distributors can result in products that do not meet our quality control or industry standards or fail to comply with the relevant regulatory requirements, which in turn can result in finished consumer goods that do not comply with applicable standards and requirements. products that are mislabeled, contaminated or damaged could result in a regulatory non-compliance event or even a product recall by the fda or a similar foreign agency. for instance, the company had determined in the past that certain grades of microcrystalline cellulose (avicel® ph 101, 102, and 200 nf and avicel® rc-591 nf) were found to be out-of-specification. although the company does not expect the oos conductivity issue to affect the functionality of avicel® nf grades or to pose a human health hazard, corrective actions have been implemented to improve operational and laboratory conditions.
we may also be exposed to serious adverse health claims related to undetected poor quality of raw materials, internal system failures to adequately reduce or eliminate certain hazards (such as pathogens, allergens, contaminants, pesticides, physical hazards, etc.) or products that are not in line with required or agreed specifications. supply chain complexities, aging equipment and infrastructure, human errors, or other failures may exacerbate such risks.
our contracts often require us to indemnify our customers for the costs associated with a product non-compliance event, including penalties, costs and settlements arising from litigation, remediation costs or loss of sales. as our offerings are used in many products intended for human use or consumption, these consequences would be exacerbated if we or our customer did not identify the defect before the product reaches the consumer and there was a resulting impact at the consumer level. such a result could lead to potentially large-scale adverse publicity, negative effects on consumer's health, recalls and potential litigation, fines, penalties, sanctions or other regulatory actions. in addition, if we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification from suppliers or other third parties, or if insurance or indemnification is not available, the liability relating to product or possible third-party claims arising from mislabeled, contaminated or damaged products could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. furthermore, adverse publicity about our products, or our customers' products that contain our ingredients, including concerns about product safety or similar issues, whether real or perceived, could harm our reputation and result in an immediate adverse effect on our sales and customer relationships, as well as require us to utilize significant resources to rebuild our reputation.
defects, quality issues (including product recalls), inadequate disclosure or misuse with respect to the products and capabilities could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.
26
defects in, misuse of, quality issues with respect to (including products recalls) or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to our products, could lead to lost profits and other economic damage, property damage, personal injury or other liability resulting in third-party claims, criminal liability, significant costs, damage to our reputation and loss of business. any of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition and our results of operations.
failure to comply with environmental protection laws may cause us to close, relocate or operate one or more of our plants at reduced production levels, and expose us to civil or criminal liability, which could adversely affect our operating results and future growth.
our business operations and properties procure, make use of, manufacture, sell, and distribute substances that are sometimes considered hazardous and are therefore subject to extensive and increasingly stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to protection of the environment, including air emissions, sewage discharges, the use of hazardous materials, waste disposal practices and clean-up of existing environmental contamination.
failure to comply with these laws and regulations or any future changes to them may result in significant consequences to us, including the need to close or relocate one or more of our production facilities, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, fines, sanctions, litigation, costly remediation measures, liability for damages and negative publicity. if we are unable to meet production requirements, we can lose customer orders, which can adversely affect our future growth or we may be required to make incremental capital investments to ensure supply. idling of facilities or production modifications has caused or may cause customers to seek alternate suppliers due to concerns regarding supply interruptions and these customers may not return or may order at reduced levels even once issues are remediated. if these non-compliance issues reoccur in china or occur or in any other jurisdiction, we may lose business and may be required to incur capital spending above previous expectations, close a plant, or operate a plant at significantly reduced production levels on a permanent basis, and our operating results and cash flows from operations may be adversely affected.
we could be adversely affected by violations, by us or our counterparties, of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, similar u.s. or foreign anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations, applicable sanctions laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate or ethical business practices and related laws and regulations.
the global nature of our business, our increased size and employee count, the significance of our international revenue, our focus on emerging markets and presence in regulated industries create various domestic and local regulatory challenges and subject us to risks associated with our international operations. the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (the "fcpa") and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations in other countries generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or for other commercial advantage. in addition, u.s. public companies are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls. under the fcpa, u.s. companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by directors, officers, employees, agents, or other strategic or local partners or representatives. as such, if we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the fcpa or similar legislation, governmental authorities in the u.s. and elsewhere could seek to impose substantial civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition.
we operate or may pursue opportunities in some jurisdictions, such as china, india, brazil, russia and africa, that pose potentially elevated risks of fraud or corruption or increased risk of internal control issues. in certain jurisdictions, compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. from time to time, we have conducted and will conduct internal investigations of the relevant facts and circumstances, control testing and compliance reviews, and take remedial actions, when appropriate, to help ensure that we are in compliance with applicable corruption and similar laws and regulations. for example, in august 2019, during the integration of frutarom, we were made aware of allegations that two frutarom businesses operating principally in russia and ukraine made certain improper payments, including to representatives of a number of customers. our investigation substantiated the allegations that improper payments to representatives of customers were made and that key members of frutarom's senior management at the time were aware of such payments. we did not uncover any evidence suggesting that such payments had any connection to the u.s. in addition, frutarom grew through rapid acquisition and, as part of our integration efforts, we have implemented our anti-corruption and similar policies throughout a number of those acquired companies, many of which were not previously subject to these u.s. laws.
detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of the fcpa or other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations is expensive, could consume significant time and attention of our senior management and could subject us to investigations and inquiries by governmental and other regulatory bodies. any allegations of non-compliance with such laws and regulations could have a disruptive effect on our operations in such jurisdiction, including interruptions of business or loss of third-party relationships, which may negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition. any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with such laws and regulations could expose us to severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, significant fines, termination of necessary licenses and permits and penalties or other sanctions that may harm our business and reputation.
27
given the international scope of our business, we also sell certain of our products to countries that are subject to u.s. and other sanctions under general licenses and authorizations related to such products, technologies and transactions. for example, the u.s., the european union and other countries have imposed sanctions and export controls on russia, belarus and occupied regions of ukraine. as a result, we have limited our export of ingredients to customers in russia, belarus and occupied regions of ukraine to only those that are permitted and meet the essential needs of people. compliance with sanctions laws is highly technical and requires careful oversight, and it is possible that actions taken by us, our subsidiaries or our suppliers may cause us to be in breach with these laws, which could have a material adverse effect to our business.
in addition, our reputation and our customers' willingness to purchase our products depend in part on our compliance by our suppliers, distributors, customers or other counterparties with ethical employment practices, such as with respect to child labor, wages and benefits, forced labor, discrimination, safe and healthy working conditions, as well as with all legal and regulatory requirements relating to the conduct of their businesses (including the ones mentioned in the preceding paragraphs). while we generally require that third-parties we work with agree to our code of conduct, we do not exercise control over our suppliers, distributors, vendors and customers and due to the global nature of our business cannot guarantee their compliance with such ethical and lawful business practices or such legal requirements. if our counterparties fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations, safety codes, employment practices, human rights standards, quality standards, environmental standards, production practices, or other obligations, norms, or ethical standards, our reputation and brand image could be harmed, and we could be exposed to litigation, investigations, enforcement actions, monetary liability, and additional costs that would harm our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights.
we rely on patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property rights. we often rely on trade secrets to protect our products, manufacturing processes, extract methodologies and other processes, as this does not require us to publicly file information regarding our intellectual property. from time to time, a third party may claim that we have infringed upon or misappropriated their intellectual property rights, or a third party may infringe upon or misappropriate our intellectual property rights. we could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert our intellectual property rights against third parties or to defend ourselves from third-party assertions of invalidity, infringement, misappropriation or other claims. any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such litigation could require us to obtain a license to continue to use the intellectual property rights that are the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of such intellectual property rights. any required licensing fees may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. for those intellectual property rights that are protected as trade secrets, this litigation could result in even higher costs, and potentially the loss of certain rights, since we would not have a perfected intellectual property right that precludes others from making, using or selling our products or processes. the ongoing trend among our customers towards more transparent labeling could further diminish our ability to effectively protect our products.
we vigilantly protect our intellectual property rights, including trade secrets. we have designed and implemented internal controls intended to restrict access to and distribution of our respective intellectual property. despite these precautions, our intellectual property is vulnerable to unauthorized access through employee error or actions, theft and cybersecurity incidents, and other security breaches, including due to increasing use of ai tools. see, also - "we are subject to risks associated with the potential use of ai in our own operations and by third-party partners that we may engage with." protecting intellectual property related to biotechnology is particularly challenging because theft can be difficult to detect and biotechnology can be self-replicating. accordingly, the impact of such theft can be significant.
for intellectual property rights that we seek to protect through patents, we cannot be certain that these rights, if obtained, will not later be opposed, invalidated or circumvented. in addition, even if such rights are obtained in the u.s., the laws of some other countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the u.s. for instance, we may be unable to obtain or defend intellectual property rights in new and inventive technology developed in whole or in part by relying on ai tools. if other parties were to infringe on our intellectual property rights, or if our intellectual property rights were the subject of unauthorized access leading to competitive pressure or if a third party successfully asserted that we had infringed on their intellectual property rights, it could materially and adversely affect our future results of operations by, among other things, (i) being required to cease production and marketing or reducing the price that we could obtain in the marketplace for products which are based on such rights, (ii) increasing the royalty or other fees that we may be required to pay in connection with such rights, (iii) limiting the volume, if any, of such products that we can sell or (iv) resulting in significant litigation costs and potential liability.
changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new u.s. or international tax legislation, or changes in existing tax laws could expose us to additional tax liabilities that may affect our future results.
we are subject to taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and
28
liabilities, changes in liabilities for uncertain tax positions, cost of repatriations or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.
we have and will continue to implement transfer pricing policies among our various operations located in different countries. these transfer pricing policies are a significant component of the management and compliance of our operations across international boundaries and overall financial results. many countries routinely examine transfer pricing policies of taxpayers subject to their jurisdiction, challenge transfer pricing policies aggressively where there is potential non-compliance and impose significant interest charges and penalties where non-compliance is determined. however, governmental authorities could challenge these policies more aggressively in the future and, if challenged, we may not prevail. we could suffer significant costs related to one or more challenges to our transfer pricing policies.
we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service, state tax authorities and foreign tax authorities in those countries in which we operate, and may be subject to assessments or audits in the future in any of the countries in which we operate. the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals, and while we do not believe the results that follow would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, such results could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods in which that determination is made.
in addition, a number of international legislative and regulatory bodies have proposed legislation and begun investigations of the tax practices of multi-national companies and, in the european union, the tax policies of certain european union member states. in december 2021, the organisation for economic co-operation and development ("oecd") released the pillar two model rules to reform international corporate taxation that aim to ensure that applicable multinationals (global revenue exceeding €750 million) pay a minimum effective corporate tax rate of 15%. the rules are due to be passed into national legislation based on each country's approach, and some countries have already enacted or substantively enacted the rules. the oecd continues to release additional guidance on the two-pillar framework, with widespread implementation anticipated by 2024. we are continuing to evaluate the potential impact on future periods of the pillar two framework, pending legislative adoption by individual countries. this new legislation may have a material effect on our effective tax rate, income tax expense, net income or cash flows.
since 2013, the european commission ("ec") has been investigating tax rulings granted by tax authorities in a number of european union member states with respect to specific multi-national corporations to determine whether such rulings comply with european union rules on state aid, as well as more recent investigations of the tax regimes of certain european union member states. under european union law, selective tax advantages for particular taxpayers that are not sufficiently grounded in economic realities may constitute impermissible state aid. if the ec determines that a tax ruling or tax regime violates the state aid restrictions, the tax authorities of the affected european union member state may be required to collect back taxes for the period of time covered by the ruling. if the ec or tax authorities in other jurisdictions were to successfully challenge tax rulings applicable to us in any of the member states in which we are subject to taxation or our internal intercompany arrangements, we could be exposed to increased tax liabilities.
in august 2022, the u.s. government enacted legislation commonly referred to as the "inflation reduction act", which, among other things, imposes a minimum "book" tax on certain corporations effective for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2022 and creates a new excise tax on stock repurchases made by certain publicly traded corporations after december 31, 2022. we will continue to evaluate its impact as further guidance becomes available.
the n&b transaction could result in significant tax liability, and we may be obligated to indemnify dupont for any such tax liability imposed on dupont.
the completion of the n&b transaction in 2021 was conditioned upon the receipt by dupont of an opinion that the transaction generally will qualify as a tax-free reorganization. the tax opinion was based upon various factual representations and assumptions, as well as certain undertakings made by dupont, iff and n&b. if any of those factual representations or assumptions were untrue or incomplete in any material respect, any undertaking was or is not complied with, or the facts upon which the opinion was based are materially different from the facts at the closing of the n&b transaction, the transaction may not qualify (in whole or part) for tax-free treatment.
the n&b spin-off and certain aspects of the pre-spin-off internal reorganizations to form n&b could be taxable to dupont if n&b or we were to engage in a "spinco tainting act" (as defined in the tax matters agreement, by and among dupont, n&b and iff, a form of which is attached to iff's registration statement on form s-4 (registration number 333-238072)). a spinco tainting act is generally any action (or inaction) within our control or under the control of n&b or their affiliates, any event involving our common stock or the common stock of n&b or any assets of n&b or its subsidiaries, or any breach by n&b or any of its subsidiaries of any factual representations, assumptions, or undertakings made by it, in each case, that would affect the non-recognition treatment of the spin-off and internal reorganizations for u.s. federal income tax purposes, as described above. under the tax matters agreement, we and n&b will be required to indemnify dupont for any taxes resulting from a spinco tainting act. if we were required to indemnify dupont pursuant to the tax matters agreement as described
29
above, this indemnification obligation may be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on us, including with respect to our financial condition and results of operations.
moreover, we are not indemnified for tax liabilities related to pre-spin-off periods. tax liabilities could increase as an outcome of final determination of tax examinations and could adversely impact our financial results.
if we fail to comply with data protection laws in the u.s. and abroad, we may be subject to fines, penalties and other costs.
legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data continue to evolve, and regulatory scrutiny in this area is increasing around the world. this regulatory environment is increasingly challenging and may present material obligations and risks to our business, including significantly expanded compliance burdens, restrictions on transfer of personal data, costs and enforcement risks. many governments have enacted or are enacting new or updated data protection laws, including data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders. all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements, restrictions on use of personal data, as well as the uncertain interpretation and enforcement of laws, impose significant costs and regulatory risks that are likely to increase over time. our failure to comply with these evolving regulations could expose us to fines, sanctions, penalties and other costs that could harm our reputation and adversely impact our financial results.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
(unless indicated otherwise, dollars in millions except per share amounts)
overview company background on february 1, 2021, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries merged with and into the n&b business (the "merger"), pursuant to a merger agreement with dupont. the shares issued in the merger represented approximately 55.4% of the common stock of iff on a fully diluted basis, after giving effect to the merger, as of february 1, 2021. the n&b business is an innovation-driven and customer-focused business that provides solutions for the global food and beverage, dietary supplements, home and personal care, energy, animal nutrition and pharma markets. the transaction was made in order to strengthen iff's customer base and market presence, with an enhanced position in the food & beverage, home & personal care and health & wellness markets. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the n&b transaction.
as a result of the n&b transaction, and following our prior 2018 acquisition of frutarom industries ltd., we have expanded our global leadership positions, which now include high-value ingredients and solutions in the food & beverage, home & personal care and health & wellness markets, and across key taste, texture, scent, nutrition, enzymes, cultures, soy proteins, pharmaceutical excipients and probiotics categories.
33
we are organized into four segments: nourish, health & biosciences, scent and pharma solutions. our consolidated financial information for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 reflects the results of n&b for the full twelve months of 2023 and 2022, whereas the year ended december 31, 2021 only reflects the results of n&b for eleven months of 2021.
our nourish segment consists of an innovative and broad portfolio of natural-based ingredients to enhance nutritional value, texture and functionality in a wide range of beverage, dairy, bakery, confectionery and culinary applications and consists of ingredients, flavors and food designs.
our health & biosciences segment consists of the development and production of an advanced biotechnology-derived portfolio of enzymes, food cultures, probiotics and specialty ingredients for food and non-food applications. among many other applications, this biotechnology-driven portfolio includes cultures for use in fermented foods such as yogurt, cheese and fermented beverages, probiotic strains, many with documented clinical health claims for use as dietary supplements and through industrial fermentation the production of enzymes and microorganisms that provide product and process performance benefits to household detergents, animal feed, ethanol production and brewing. health & biosciences is comprised of health, cultures & food enzymes, home & personal care, animal nutrition and grain processing.
our scent segment creates fragrance compounds, fragrance ingredients and cosmetic ingredients that are integral elements in the world's finest perfumes and best-known household and personal care products. consumer insights science and creativity are at the heart of our scent business, and, along with our unique portfolio of natural and synthetic ingredients, global footprint, innovative technologies and know-how, and customer intimacy, we believe make us a market leader in scent products. the scent segment is comprised of fragrance compounds, fragrance ingredients and cosmetic ingredients.
our pharma solutions segment produces, among other things, a vast portfolio of cellulosics and seaweed-based pharmaceutical excipients, used to improve the functionality and delivery of active pharmaceutical ingredients, including controlled or modified drug release formulations, and enabling the development of more effective pharmaceutical finished dosage formulations. our excipients are used in prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements. our pharma solutions products also serve a variety of other specialty and industrial end-uses including coatings, inks, electronics, agriculture and consumer products.
financial measures - currency neutral our financial results include the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. we provide currency neutral calculations in this report to remove the impact of foreign currency exchange rates fluctuations. we calculate currency neutral numbers by translating current year invoiced sale amounts at the exchange rates used for the corresponding prior year period. we use currency neutral results in our analysis of subsidiary and/or segment performance. we also use currency neutral numbers when analyzing our performance against our competitors.
impairment of goodwill during 2023, we determined that the carrying value of the nourish reporting unit exceeded its fair value and recorded an impairment charge of $2.623 billion in the consolidated statements of (loss) income and comprehensive loss for the year ended december 31, 2023.
during 2022, we determined that the carrying value of the health & biosciences reporting unit exceeded its fair value and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $2.250 billion in the consolidated statements of (loss) income and comprehensive loss for the year ended december 31, 2022.
see "critical accounting policies and use of estimates" and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. for more detailed information about risks related to impairment of goodwill, refer to item 1a, "risk factors" - "any impairment of our tangible or intangible long-lived assets, including goodwill, may adversely impact our profitability."
impact related to the israel-hamas war we maintain operations in israel and, additionally, export products to customers in israel from operations outside the region. we will continue to evaluate the current events and any potential impacts related to this matter, but we do not expect there to be a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.
in 2023, total sales to israeli customers were approximately 1% of total sales.
impact related to the russia-ukraine war we maintain operations in both russia and ukraine and, additionally, export products to customers in russia and ukraine from operations outside the region. in response to the events in ukraine, we have limited the production and supply of ingredients in and to russia to only those that meet the essential needs of people, including food, hygiene and medicine.
34
in 2023, total sales to russian customers were approximately 1% of total sales. in 2022, total sales to russian customers were approximately 2% of total sales.
in 2023 and 2022, total sales to ukrainian customers were both less than 1% of total sales.
we have a reserve of approximately $3 million related to expected credit losses on receivables from customers located in russia and ukraine. during the second quarter of 2022, we also recorded a charge of $120 million related to the impairment of certain long-lived assets in russia. see note 1, note 5 and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
for more detailed information about risks related to the russia-ukraine war and the israel-hamas war, refer to item 1a, "risk factors" - international conflicts (such as the russia-ukraine war and israel-hamas war), geopolitical events, natural disasters, public health crises (such as the covid-19 pandemic), trade wars, terrorist acts, labor strikes, political or economic crises (such as uncertainty related to protracted u.s. federal government funding negotiations), accidents and other events could adversely affect our business and financial results, including by disrupting development, manufacturing, distribution or sale of our products.
impact of covid-19 pandemic on march 11, 2020, the world health organization designated covid-19 as a global pandemic. as a result of disruptions or uncertainty relating to the covid-19 pandemic, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, increased costs, delays or limited availability related to raw materials, strain on shipping and transportation resources, and higher energy prices, which have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, our margins and operating results. we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of these potential impacts to our business, consolidated results of operations, segment results, liquidity and capital resources.
for more detailed information about risks related to covid-19 pandemic, refer to item 1a, "risk factors" - international conflicts (such as the russia-ukraine war and israel-hamas war), geopolitical events, natural disasters, public health crises (such as the covid-19 pandemic), trade wars, terrorist acts, labor strikes, political or economic crises (such as uncertainty related to protracted u.s. federal government funding negotiations), accidents and other events could adversely affect our business and financial results, including by disrupting development, manufacturing, distribution or sale of our products.
2023 financial performance overview for a reconciliation between reported and adjusted figures, please refer to the "non-gaap financial measures" section.
sales sales in 2023 decreased $961 million, or 8% on a reported basis, to $11.479 billion compared to $12.440 billion in the 2022 period. on a currency neutral basis, sales in 2023 decreased 6% compared to the 2022 period. exchange rate variations had an unfavorable impact on net sales in 2023 of 2%. the effect of exchange rates can vary by business and region, depending upon the mix of sales priced in u.s. dollars as compared to other currencies. in addition, the decrease in sales was primarily driven by volume decreases across various businesses and the net impact of the divestitures of the microbial control business unit, the portion of the savory solutions business, and flavor specialty ingredients ("fsi") business and the acquisition of health wright products, inc. (collectively, the "net impact of the change in business portfolio mix"), which was approximately $572 million, offset in part by price increases across all businesses.
our 25 largest customers accounted for approximately 32% of total sales in 2023. in 2023, no customer accounted for more than 10% of sales. a key factor for commercial success is our inclusion on strategic customers' core supplier lists, which provides opportunities to expand and win new business. we are on the core supplier lists of a large majority of our global and strategic customers.
gross profit gross profit in 2023 decreased $470 million, or 11% on a reported basis, to $3.681 billion (32.1% of sales) compared to $4.151 billion (33.4% of sales) in the 2022 period. the decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by volume decreases, the net impact of the change in business portfolio mix and unfavorable manufacturing absorption primarily related to our inventory reduction program, offset in part by favorable net pricing and productivity gains.

(1)currency neutral sales is calculated by translating current year invoiced sale amounts at the exchange rates for the corresponding prior year period.
nourish nourish sales in 2023 decreased $769 million, or 11% on a reported basis, to $6.060 billion compared to $6.829 billion in the 2022 period. on a currency neutral basis, nourish sales decreased 9% in 2023 compared to the 2022 period as exchange rate variations had an unfavorable impact. in addition, performance in the nourish operating segment was driven by volume decreases across various business units and the divestiture of the portion of the savory solutions business, with an impact of approximately $310 million, offset in part by price increases across all business units.
health & biosciences health & biosciences sales in 2023 decreased $258 million, or 11% on a reported basis, to $2.081 billion compared to $2.339 billion in the 2022 period. on a currency neutral basis, health & biosciences sales decreased 10% in 2023 compared to the 2022 period as exchange rate variations had an unfavorable impact. in addition, performance in the health & biosciences operating segment was driven by the net impact of the divestiture of the microbial control business unit and acquisition of health wright products, inc., which was approximately $228 million, and volume decreases across various business units, offset in part by price increases across all business units.
scent scent sales in 2023 increased $92 million, or 4% on a reported basis, to $2.393 billion compared to $2.301 billion in the 2022 period. on a currency neutral basis, scent sales increased 6% in 2023 compared to the 2022 period as exchange rate variations had an unfavorable impact. in addition, performance in the scent operating segment was driven by price increases, primarily in fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients, and volume increases, offset in part by the divestiture of the fsi business, with an impact of approximately $34 million.
pharma solutions pharma solutions sales in 2023 decreased $26 million, or 3% on a reported basis, to $945 million compared to $971 million in the 2022 period. on a currency neutral basis, pharma solutions sales also decreased 3% in 2023 compared to the 2022 period as the impact of exchange rate variations was flat. in addition, performance in the pharma solutions operating segment was driven by volume decreases, offset in part by price increases.
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold decreased $491 million to $7.798 billion (67.9% of sales) in 2023 compared to $8.289 billion (66.6% of sales) in 2022. the decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily driven by volume decreases in sales and the net impact of the change in business portfolio mix, which was approximately $405 million, offset in part by unfavorable manufacturing absorption primarily related to our inventory reduction program and a write-down of inventory related to locust bean kernel ("lbk") in nourish, which was approximately $72 million.
research and development (r&d) expenses r&d expenses increased $33 million to $636 million (5.5% of sales) in 2023 compared to $603 million (4.8% of sales) in 2022. the increase in r&d expenses was primarily driven by higher operating expenses for r&d related activities, offset in part by the net impact of the change in business portfolio mix.
37
selling and administrative (s&a) expenses s&a expenses increased $19 million to $1.787 billion (15.6% of sales) in 2023 compared to $1.768 billion (14.2% of sales) in 2022. the increase in s&a expenses was primarily driven by higher operating expenses for s&a related activities and legal fees incurred for the ongoing investigations of the fragrance businesses, offset in part by lower professional fees, including consulting costs, and the net impact of the change in business portfolio mix.
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges increased to $68 million in 2023 compared to $12 million in 2022. the increase was driven by higher severance costs incurred as part of the 2023 restructuring program, net of reversals of prior severance cost accruals. see note 2 for additional information.
amortization of acquisition-related intangibles amortization expenses decreased to $680 million in 2023 compared to $727 million in 2022. the decrease in amortization expense was primarily driven by the reduction in intangible assets as a result of the divestitures of the microbial control business unit in 2022, the portion of the savory solutions business and fsi business in 2023, an impairment of intangible assets of an asset group that operates primarily in russia during 2022 and intangible assets of the portion of the savory solutions business, fsi business and cosmetic ingredients business being classified as "held for sale," and therefore no longer recognizing amortization expense on those intangible assets. the portion of the savory solutions business and fsi business were classified as held for sale up until may 31, 2023 and august 1, 2023, respectively, when we completed the divestiture of the businesses (see note 4, note 6 and note 21 for additional information). the decrease in amortization expense was offset in part by the impact of acquisitions of intangible assets from health wright products, inc.
impairment of goodwill the impairment of goodwill was $2.623 billion in 2023 compared to $2.250 billion in 2022, which was related to the nourish and health & biosciences reporting units, respectively. see note 1 and note 6 for additional information.
impairment of long-lived assets there was no impairment of long-lived assets in 2023. impairment of long-lived assets was $120 million in 2022. the impairment charge was due to the uncertainties related to our operations in russia and ukraine and was allocated on a pro rata basis to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. see note 1, note 5 and note 6 for additional information.
interest expense interest expense increased $44 million to $380 million in 2023 compared to $336 million in 2022. the increase in interest expense was due to higher interest rates on our cash pooling arrangements, commercial paper borrowings, outstanding term loan facilities (see note 9 for additional information) and factoring programs (see note 1 for additional information).
other expense (income), net other expense (income), net, decreased $65 million to an expense of $28 million in 2023 compared to income of $37 million in 2022. the change was primarily due to higher foreign exchange losses and losses incurred from business divestitures, such as the liquidation of a business in russia for the sale of the portion of the savory solutions business and divestitures of the portion of the savory solutions business and fsi business (see note 4 for additional information), compared to gains incurred from the divestiture of the microbial control business unit in 2022, offset in part by the gain resulting from the completion of the china facility relocation (see note 19 for additional information) and higher pension-related benefits.
income taxes the effective tax rate in 2023 was (1.8)% compared to (14.7)% in 2022. the year-over-year change was primarily driven by book to tax differences related to impairment of goodwill, lower tax charges on business divestitures and the recognition of a deferred tax benefit related to an internal restructuring.
segment adjusted operating ebitda results by business unit we use segment adjusted operating ebitda for internal reporting and performance measurement purposes. segment adjusted operating ebitda is defined as (loss) income before taxes before depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, restructuring and other charges and certain items that are not related to recurring operations. our determination of reportable segments was made on the basis of our strategic priorities within each segment and corresponds to the manner in which our chief operating decision maker reviews and evaluates operating performance to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment. in addition to our strategic priorities, segment reporting is also based on differences in the products and services we provide.

2022 in comparison to 2021
for a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021, see "part ii, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of our form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2022, filed with the sec on february 27, 2023.
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $729 million, inclusive of $26 million currently in assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets, at december 31, 2023 compared to $535 million, inclusive of $52 million in assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets, at december 31, 2022 and of this balance, a portion was held outside the united states. cash balances held in foreign jurisdictions are, in most circumstances, available to be repatriated to the united states.
effective utilization of the cash generated by our international operations is a critical component of our strategy. we regularly repatriate cash from our non-u.s. subsidiaries to fund financial obligations in the u.s. as we repatriate these funds to the u.s. we will be required to pay income taxes in certain u.s. states and applicable foreign withholding taxes during the period when such repatriation occurs. accordingly, as of december 31, 2023, we had a deferred tax liability of approximately $155 million for the effect of repatriating the funds to the u.s., attributable to various non-u.s. subsidiaries. there is no deferred tax liability associated with non-u.s. subsidiaries where we intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings to fund local operations and/or capital projects.
cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities in 2023 were $1.439 billion, or 12.5% of sales, compared to $397 million, or 3.2% of sales, in 2022 and $1.437 billion, or 12.3% of sales, in 2021. the increase in cash flows from operating activities from 2022 to 2023 was primarily driven by the decrease in working capital, largely related to inventories and accounts receivable, offset in part by lower cash earnings, excluding the impact of non-cash adjustments. the decrease in cash flows from operating activities from 2021 to 2022 was primarily driven by the increase in working capital, largely related to inventories and accounts payable.
cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities cash flows provided by investing activities in 2023 were $574 million compared to $745 million in 2022 and cash flows used in investing activities of $18 million in 2021. the decrease in cash flows from investing activities from 2022 to 2023 was primarily driven by the net impact of the change in net proceeds received from business divestitures and unwinding of derivative instruments, offset by the change in cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash received and higher proceeds from disposal of assets. the increase in cash flows from investing activities from 2021 to 2022 was primarily driven by the change in net proceeds received from business divestiture and unwinding of derivative instruments, offset in part by the change in cash provided by the merger with n&b, higher spending on property, plant and equipment and cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash received in 2022.
we have evaluated and re-prioritized our capital projects and expect that capital spending in 2024 will be approximately 4.9% of sales (net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities).
cash flows used in financing activities cash flows used in financing activities in 2023 were $1.851 billion compared to $1.229 billion and $1.304 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. the increase in cash flows used in financing activities from 2022 to 2023 was primarily driven by higher repayments of long-term and short-term debts, compared to lower net repayments of long-term and short-term debts in 2022, and higher net repayments of commercial paper. the decrease in cash flows used in financing activities from 2021 to 2022 was primarily driven by lower repayments of long-term debt and an increase in revolving credit facility and short-term borrowings, offset in part by net repayments of commercial paper, compared to proceeds from issuance of commercial paper in 2021, higher cash dividend payments and higher purchases of redeemable non-controlling interests.
40
we paid dividends totaling $826 million, $810 million and $667 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the cash dividend declared per share in 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $3.24, $3.20 and $3.12, respectively.
our capital allocation strategy is primarily focused on debt repayment to maintain our investment grade rating. we will also prioritize capital investment in our businesses to support the strategic long-term plans. we are also committed to maintaining our history of paying a dividend to investors determined by our board of directors at its discretion based on various factors.
capital resources operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for capital investment needs, dividends paid to shareholders and debt service repayments. we anticipate that cash flows from operations, cash proceeds generated from planned business divestitures and availability under our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our investing and financing needs, including our debt service requirements. we regularly assess our capital structure, including both current and long-term debt instruments, as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility and to optimize our leverage ratios. see note 9 for additional information.
transaction with nutrition & biosciences, inc.
on february 1, 2021, the n&b term loan facility was funded, which provided for a senior unsecured term loan credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.250 billion, comprised of a $625 million three-year tranche ("2024 term loan facility") and a $625 million five-year tranche ("2026 term loan facility"). following the merger, we assumed the indebtedness incurred by n&b in the debt financings, which included (i) the 2024 term loan facility and 2026 term loan facility and (ii) a series of senior notes in the aggregate amount of $6.250 billion with maturities ranging from 2 to 30 years. n&b's indebtedness raised prior to the merger was used to finance the special cash payment (as defined below) to dupont, which has been paid, and for the satisfaction of the related transaction fees and expenses. see note 3 and note 9 for additional information.
in connection with the n&b transaction, a wholly owned subsidiary of iff merged with and into n&b in exchange for 141,740,461 shares of iff common stock, par value $0.125 per share ("iff common stock"), which had been approved in the special shareholder meeting that occurred on august 27, 2020 where iff shareholders voted to approve the issuance of shares of iff common stock in connection with the n&b transaction pursuant to the merger agreement. in connection with the n&b transaction, dupont received a one-time $7.359 billion special cash payment (the "special cash payment"). the shares issued in the merger represented approximately 55.4% of the common stock of iff on a fully diluted basis, after giving effect to the merger, as of february 1, 2021. see note 3 for additional information.
term loans and revolving credit facility our credit agreements contain various covenants, limitations and events of default customary for similar facilities for similarly rated borrowers, including the requirement for us to maintain, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to credit adjusted ebitda in respect of the previous 12-month period. on march 23, 2023, we entered into term loan amendment no. 3, term loan amendment no. 4, revolver amendment no. 2 and revolver amendment no. 3. on september 19, 2023, we entered into term loan amendment no. 5 and revolver amendment no. 4.
term loan amendment no. 3 and revolver amendment no. 2, among other things, extended the period during which certain relief was provided with respect to the financial covenant contained in the existing term loan credit agreement and the existing revolving credit agreement, respectively, which have been superseded by term loan amendment no. 5 and revolver amendment no. 4, respectively.
additionally, the reference rate for u.s. dollar-denominated loans was updated from libor to term sofr. from march 23, 2023, the term loans and revolving credit facility now bear interest at a base rate or a rate equal to term sofr plus an adjustment of 0.10% per annum or, in the case of euro-denominated loans, the euro interbank offered rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on our public debt rating. loans may be prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs.
term loan amendment no. 5 and revolver amendment no. 4, among other things, extend the period during which a term loan covenant relief period and revolver covenant relief period are provided with respect to the financial covenant contained in the existing term loan credit agreement and the existing revolving credit agreement, respectively, through december 31, 2025, or such earlier date on which the company elects to terminate such period, by providing that during the term loan covenant relief period and revolver covenant relief period, our consolidated leverage ratio shall not exceed as of the end of the fiscal quarter for the period of the four fiscal quarters then ended: (i) 5.25x for any fiscal quarter ending on or before march 31, 2024, (ii) 4.75x for the fiscal quarter ending june 30, 2024, (iii) 4.50x for the fiscal quarter ending september 30, 2024, (iv) 4.25x for any subsequent fiscal quarter ending on or before march 31, 2025, (v) 4.00x for any subsequent fiscal quarter ending on or before september 30, 2025 and (vi) 3.75x for the fiscal quarter ending december 31, 2025.
41
during the term loan covenant relief period and the revolver covenant relief period, the amendments prohibit us from (i) effecting share repurchases, (ii) declaring and paying dividends in cash on common stock in excess of $0.81 per share per fiscal quarter (for an aggregate amount of $3.24 per fiscal year) and (iii) creating liens to secure debt in excess of the greater of $300 million and 3.65% of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the term loan credit agreement and revolving credit agreement), in each case subject to certain exceptions set forth therein. see note 9 for additional information on the amendments to the credit agreements.
as of december 31, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under our $2.000 billion revolving credit facility. the amount that we are able to draw down under the revolving credit facility is limited by financial covenants as described in more detail below. as of december 31, 2023, our borrowing capacity was approximately $1.548 billion under the revolving credit facility.
see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our credit agreements.
debt covenants at december 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under our credit agreements, including the net debt to credit adjusted ebitda(1) ratio. at december 31, 2023 our net debt to credit adjusted ebitda(1) ratio was 4.51 to 1.0 as defined by the credit facility agreements, which is below the relevant level provided by our financial covenants of existing outstanding debt. the most comparable gaap measure is the total debt to net loss ratio, which was (3.93) to 1.0 at december 31, 2023.
_______________________
(1)credit adjusted ebitda and net debt, which are non-gaap measures used for these covenants, are calculated in accordance with the definition in the debt agreements. in this context, these measures are used solely to provide information on the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and may not be comparable to credit adjusted ebitda and net debt used by other companies. reconciliations of credit adjusted ebitda to net loss and net debt to total debt are as follows:

critical accounting policies and use of estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. as disclosed in note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures. these estimates are based on management's best judgment of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future. actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.
those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve:
business combinations from time to time we enter into strategic acquisitions in an effort to better service existing customers and to attain new customers. when we acquire a controlling financial interest in an entity or group of assets that are determined to meet the definition of a business, we apply the acquisition method described in asc topic 805, business combinations. in accordance with gaap, the results of the acquisitions we have completed are reflected in our financial statements from the date of acquisition forward.
we allocate the purchase consideration paid to acquire the business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values at the acquisition date, with the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. if during the measurement period (a period not to exceed twelve months from the acquisition date) we receive additional information that existed as of the acquisition date but at the time of the original allocation described above was unknown to us, we make the appropriate adjustments to the purchase price allocation in the reporting period in which the amounts are determined.
significant judgment is required to estimate the intangibles and fair value of fixed assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. accordingly, we typically engage third-party valuation specialists, who work under the direction of management, to assist in valuing significant tangible and intangible assets acquired.
the fair value estimates are based on available historical information, future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain.
we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants, and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates, discount rates and profitability), royalty rates used in the relief of royalty method, customer attrition rates, product obsolescence factors, a brand's relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.
determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires significant judgment. all of our acquired intangible assets (e.g., trademarks, product formulas, non-compete agreements and customer relationships) are expected to have finite useful lives. our estimates of the useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets are based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the regions in which the brands are sold.
the costs of finite-lived intangible assets are amortized through expense over their estimated lives. the value of residual goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment as described in the following note. for acquired intangible assets, the remaining useful life of the trade names and trademarks, product formulas, and customer relationships was estimated at the point at which substantially all of the present value of cumulative cash flows have been earned.
the periodic assessment of potential impairment of goodwill as of december 31, 2023, we have goodwill of approximately $10.635 billion. we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level as of november 30 every year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component) to which goodwill is assigned when initially recorded.
44
we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each operating segment regularly reviews the operating results of those components. components within a segment that have similar economic characteristics have been aggregated as a single reporting unit. we determined that we have six reporting units under the nourish, health & biosciences, scent and pharma solutions segments: (1) nourish, (2) fragrance compounds, (3) fragrance ingredients, (4) cosmetic ingredients, (5) health & biosciences and (6) pharma solutions.
for the annual impairment test as of november 30, 2023, we first utilized step 0 of the guidance in asc topic 350, intangibles - goodwill and other, which allows for the assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. if, based on a review of qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. based on a review of qualitative factors, we determined that for one of the reporting units, cosmetic ingredients, a quantitative (step 1) impairment analysis was not necessary to determine if the carrying values of the reporting unit exceeded its fair values. for the other five reporting units, we determined that a step 1 test was necessary.
we assessed the fair value of the reporting units using an income approach. under the income approach, we determined the fair value by using a discounted cash flow method at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the projected future cash flows of each reporting unit, as well as a terminal value. we used the most current actual and forecasted operating data available. key estimates and assumptions used in these valuations include revenue growth rates, gross margins, adjusted operating ebitda margins, terminal growth rates and discount rates.
in performing the quantitative impairment test, we determined that the fair value of four of the five reporting units exceeded their carrying values and determined that there was no further impairment of goodwill in these reporting units as of november 30, 2023. we determined that the carrying value of the nourish reporting unit exceeded its fair value and recorded an impairment charge of $2.623 billion in the consolidated statements of (loss) income and comprehensive loss for the year ended december 31, 2023. the primary drivers of the impairment charge was a decrease in fair value due to declines in projections of the reporting unit, impacts of continued inflation and increases in interest rates. based on the quantitative impairment test performed, we determined that the health & biosciences, fragrance ingredients and pharma solutions reporting units had excess fair value over carrying value of less than 25%. the health & biosciences, fragrance ingredients and pharma solutions reporting units had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 8%, 18% and 8%, respectively. while we believe that the assumptions used in the impairment test were reasonable, changes in key assumptions, including lower revenue growth, operating margin, terminal growth rates or increase in discount rates could result in a future impairment. such charge could have a material effect on our consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets.
during 2022, based on the quantitative impairment test using the income approach, we determined that the carrying value of the health & biosciences reporting unit exceeded its fair value and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $2.250 billion in the consolidated statements of (loss) income and comprehensive loss for the year ended december 31, 2022.
see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the periodic assessment of potential impairment of long-lived assets we review long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate that their full carrying value may not be recovered. an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by an asset or group of assets is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. if assets are determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on an estimate of fair value using various valuation techniques, including a discounted estimate of future cash flows.
due to the uncertainties related to our operations in russia and ukraine, we recorded a charge of approximately $120 million related to the impairment of certain long-lived assets in russia in the consolidated statements of (loss) income and comprehensive loss for the year ended december 31, 2022. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
new accounting standards see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.
non-gaap financial measures we use non-gaap financial measures in this form 10-k, including: (i) currency neutral metrics and (ii) adjusted operating ebitda and adjusted operating ebitda margin. we also provide the non-gaap measure net debt solely for the purpose of providing information on the extent to which the company is in compliance with debt covenants contained in its debt agreements. our non-gaap financial measures are defined below.
45
these non-gaap financial measures are intended to provide additional information regarding our underlying operating results and comparable year-over-year performance. such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with gaap and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with gaap. in discussing our historical and expected future results and financial condition, we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of, on a period-to-period comparable basis, financial amounts both including and excluding these identified items, as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. these non-gaap measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of the company's results under gaap and may not be comparable to other companies' calculation of such metrics.
adjusted operating ebitda and adjusted operating ebitda margin exclude depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, other income (expense), net, restructuring and other charges and certain items unrelated to recurring operations such as impairment of goodwill, impairment of long-lived assets, acquisition, divestiture and integration related costs, strategic initiatives costs, regulatory costs, n&b inventory step-up costs and other costs that are not related to recurring operations.

item 1a.    risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment decision. our business could be harmed if any of these risks, as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, materialize. the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. in assessing the risks described below, you should also refer to the other information contained in this form 10-k, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and schedules, and other filings with the sec.
risks related to our business and industry we depend on a limited number of major vehicle sellers for a substantial portion of our revenues. the loss of one or more of these major sellers could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position, and an inability to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our growth rates.
although no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2023, 2022, or 2021, a limited number of vehicle sellers historically have collectively accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues. vehicle sellers have terminated agreements with us in the past in particular markets, which has affected revenues in those markets. there can be no assurance that our existing agreements will not be canceled. furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into future agreements with vehicle sellers or that we will be able to retain our existing supply of salvage vehicles. a reduction in vehicles from a significant vehicle seller or any material changes in the terms of an arrangement with a significant vehicle seller could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. in addition, a failure to increase our sources of vehicle supply could adversely affect our earnings and revenue growth rates.
our expansion into markets outside the u.s., including expansions in europe, brazil, and the middle east expose us to risks arising from operating in international markets. any failure to successfully integrate businesses acquired or operational capabilities established outside the u.s. could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
we first expanded our operations outside the u.s. in fiscal 2003 with an acquisition in canada. subsequently, in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008 we made significant acquisitions in the u.k., followed by acquisitions in the u.a.e., brazil, germany, and spain in fiscal 2013, expansions into bahrain and oman in fiscal 2015, expansion into the republic of ireland and india in fiscal 2016, and an acquisition in finland in fiscal 2018, and a parts recycler in the u.k. in fiscal 2022. in addition, we continue to evaluate acquisitions and other opportunities outside of the u.s. acquisitions or other strategies to expand our operations outside of the u.s. pose substantial risks and uncertainties that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results. in particular, we may not be successful in realizing anticipated synergies from these acquisitions, or we may experience unanticipated costs or expenses integrating the acquired operations into our existing business. we have and may continue to incur substantial expenses establishing new yards and operations, acquiring buyers and sellers, and implementing shared services capabilities in international markets. among other things, we plan to ultimately deploy our proprietary auction technologies at all of our foreign operations and we cannot predict whether this deployment will be successful or will result in increases in the revenues or operating efficiencies of any acquired companies relative to their historic operating performance. integration of our respective operations, including information technology and financial and administrative functions, may not proceed as anticipated and could result in unanticipated costs or expenses such as capital expenditures that could have an adverse effect on our future operating results. we cannot provide any assurance that we will achieve our business and financial objectives in connection with these acquisitions or our strategic decision to expand our operations internationally. for example, although we continue to operate a technology and operations center in india for administrative support, we decided to suspend our salvage operations in india in fiscal 2018, until the indian market develops in a manner better suited to our business model, which did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position.
as we continue to expand our business internationally, we will need to develop policies and procedures to manage our business on a global scale. operationally, acquired businesses typically depend on key seller relationships, and our failure to maintain those relationships would have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results. moreover, success in opening and operating facilities in new markets can be dependent upon establishing new relationships with buyers and sellers, and our failure to establish those relationships could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and future operating results.
in addition, we anticipate our international operations will continue to subject us to a variety of risks associated with operating on an international basis, including:
•    the difficulty of managing and staffing foreign offices;
•    the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;
•    the need to localize our mix of product and service offerings in response to customer requirements, particularly the need to implement our online auction platform in foreign countries;
•    the need to comply with complex foreign and u.s. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations;
•    tariffs, trade barriers, trade disputes, and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to operate in certain foreign markets;
•    exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk, which may have an adverse impact on our revenues and revenue growth rates;
•    adapting to different business cultures, languages, and market structures, particularly where we seek to implement our auction model in markets where insurers have historically not played a substantial role in the disposition of salvage vehicles;
•    repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the u.s., which may result in higher effective tax rates;
•    military conflicts, including the russian invasion of ukraine;
•    public health issues, including but not limited to the covid-19 pandemic;
•    environmental issues;
•    natural and man-made disasters; and
•    political issues.
as we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and have an adverse effect on our operating results.
our business is exposed to risks associated with online commerce security and credit card fraud.
consumer concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet or the privacy of users may inhibit the growth of the internet and online commerce. to securely transmit confidential information such as customer credit card numbers, we rely on encryption and authentication technology. unanticipated events or developments could result in a compromise or breach of the systems we use to protect customer transaction data. furthermore, our servers may also be vulnerable to viruses transmitted via the internet and other points of access. while we proactively check for intrusions into our infrastructure, a new or undetected virus could cause a service disruption.
we maintain an information security program and our processing systems incorporate multiple levels of protection in order to address or otherwise mitigate these risks. despite these mitigation efforts, there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer losses in the future. under current credit card practices, we may be held liable for fraudulent credit card transactions and other payment disputes with customers. as such, we have implemented certain anti-fraud measures, including credit card verification procedures. however, a failure to adequately prevent fraudulent credit card transactions could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
our security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, insufficiency, or defective design. additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, users, or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users' or customers' data. any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
implementation of our online auction model in new markets may not result in the same synergies and benefits that we achieved when we implemented the model in the u.s., canada, and the u.k.
we believe that the implementation of our proprietary auction technologies across our operations had a favorable impact on our results of operations by increasing the size and geographic scope of our buyer base, increasing the average selling price for vehicles sold through our sales, and lowering expenses associated with vehicle sales.
for example, we implemented our online system across all of our u.s., canada, and the u.k. salvage yards between fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2008 and experienced increases in revenues and average selling prices, as well as improved operating efficiencies in those markets. in considering new markets, we consider the potential synergies from the implementation of our model based in large part on our experience in the u.s., canada, and the u.k. however, we cannot predict whether these synergies will also be realized in new markets.
failure to maintain sufficient capacity to accept additional vehicles at one or more of our storage facilities could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other sellers of vehicles.
capacity at our storage facilities varies from period to period and from region to region. for example, following adverse weather conditions in a particular area, our yards in that area may fill and limit our ability to accept additional salvage vehicles while we process existing inventories. for example, hurricane ida had, in certain quarters, an adverse effect on our operating results, in part because of yard capacity constraints in the impacted areas of the u.s. we regularly evaluate our capacity in all our markets and where appropriate, seek to increase capacity through the acquisition of additional land and yards. we may not be able to reach agreements to purchase independent storage facilities in markets where we have limited excess capacity, and zoning restrictions or difficulties obtaining use permits may limit our ability to expand our capacity through acquisitions of new land. failure to have sufficient capacity at one or more of our yards could adversely affect our relationships with insurance companies or other sellers of vehicles, which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position.
because the growth of our business has been due in large part to acquisitions and development of new facilities, the rate of growth of our business and revenues may decline if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions and develop new facilities.
we seek to increase our sales and profitability through the acquisition of complementary businesses, additional facilities and the development of new facilities. for example, in fiscal 2021, we opened one new operational facility in germany, one new operational facility in spain, ten new operational facilities in the u.s., and acquired an operational facility in des moines, iowa. in fiscal 2022, we opened one new operational facility in canada, one new operational facility in spain, and five new operational facilities in the u.s. in fiscal 2023, we opened one new operational facility in brazil, one new operational facility in germany, one new operational facility in canada, and eight new operational facilities in the u.s. as for strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses, we acquired national powersport auctions in fiscal 2017, and in fiscal 2022 we acquired hills motors ("hills") a used, or "green" parts recycler in the u.k. that has four operating facilities. the hills acquisition is currently undergoing review by the u.k. competition and markets authority ("cma"). acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including competition among prospective buyers, the availability of affordable financing in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms. there can be no assurance that we will be able to:
•    continue to acquire additional facilities on favorable terms;
•    expand existing facilities in no-growth regulatory environments;
•    obtain or retain buyers, sellers, and sales volumes in new markets or facilities;
•    increase revenues and profitability at acquired and new facilities;
•    maintain the historical revenue and earnings growth rates we have been able to obtain through facility openings and strategic acquisitions;
•    create new vehicle storage facilities that meet our current revenue and profitability requirements; or
•    obtain necessary regulatory approvals under applicable antitrust and competition laws.
in addition, certain of the acquisition agreements under which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. in most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. we cannot assure that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements. any failure to continue to successfully identify and complete acquisitions and develop new facilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position.
as we continue to expand our operations, our failure to manage growth could harm our business and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position.
our ability to manage growth depends not only on our ability to successfully integrate new facilities, but also on our ability to:
•    hire, train and manage additional qualified personnel;
•    establish new relationships or expand existing relationships with vehicle sellers;
•    identify and acquire or lease suitable premises on competitive terms;
•    secure adequate capital;
•    identify productive uses for available capital reserves; and
•    maintain the supply of vehicles from vehicle sellers.
our inability to control or manage these growth factors effectively could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position.
if we experience problems with our subhaulers and trucking fleet operations, our business could be harmed.
we rely primarily upon independent subhaulers to pick up and deliver vehicles to and from our storage facilities in the u.s., canada, brazil, the republic of ireland, germany, finland, the u.a.e., oman, bahrain, and spain. we also utilize, to a lesser extent, independent subhaulers in the u.k. our failure to pick up and deliver vehicles in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. further, an increase in fuel cost may lead to increased prices charged by our independent subhaulers, which may significantly increase our cost. we may not be able to pass these costs on to our sellers or buyers.
in addition to using independent subhaulers, in the u.s., the u.k. and germany we utilize a fleet of company trucks to pick up and deliver vehicles to and from our storage facilities in those geographies. in connection therewith, we are subject to the risks associated with providing trucking services, including but not limited to inclement weather, disruptions in transportation infrastructure, accidents and related injury claims, availability and price of fuel, any of which could result in an increase in our operating expenses and reduction in our net income.
new member programs could impact our operating results.
we have initiated and intend to continue to initiate programs to open our auctions to the general public. these programs include the registered broker program through which the public can purchase vehicles through a registered member, and copart lounge programs through which registered members can open copart storefronts in foreign markets with internet kiosks enabling the general public to search our inventory and purchase vehicles. initiating programs that allow access to our online auctions to the general public will involve material expenditures and we cannot predict what future benefit, if any, will be derived. these programs could also create additional risks including heightened regulation and litigation risk related to vehicle sales to the general public, and heightened branding, reputational, and intellectual property risk associated with allowing copart registered members to establish copart-branded storefronts in foreign jurisdictions.
factors such as mild weather conditions can have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results, as well as our revenue and earnings growth rates, by reducing the available supply of salvage vehicles. conversely, extreme weather conditions can result in an oversupply of salvage vehicles that requires us to incur abnormal expenses to respond to market demands.
mild weather conditions tend to result in a decrease in the available supply of salvage vehicles because traffic accidents decrease and fewer automobiles are damaged. accordingly, mild weather can have an adverse effect on our salvage vehicle supply, only a portion of which are referred to as inventory, which would be expected to have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results and related growth rates. conversely, our salvage vehicle supply will tend to increase in poor weather such as a harsh winter or as a result of adverse weather-related conditions such as flooding. during periods of mild weather conditions, our ability to increase our revenues and improve our operating results and related growth will be increasingly dependent on our ability to obtain additional vehicle sellers and to compete more effectively in the market, each of which is subject to the other risks and uncertainties described in these sections. in addition, extreme weather conditions, although they increase the available supply of salvage cars, can have an adverse effect on our operating results. for example, during fiscal 2023, we recognized substantial additional costs associated with hurricane ian. weather events have had, in certain quarters, an adverse effect on our operating results, in part because of yard capacity constraints in the impacted areas of the u.s.
if we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives.
our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team, all of whom are employed on an at-will basis and none of whom are subject to any agreements not to compete. if we lose the service of one or more of our senior executives or key employees, or if one or more of the senior executives or key employees decide to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives.
more generally, our future success also depends on our ability to attract and retain a talented workforce. the labor market is highly competitive, and our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain talented personnel in our organization at appropriate staffing levels. in addition, because our core technology platform is internally developed, we face heightened risks relating to workforce recruitment and retention of key personnel with subject matter expertise relating to our technology platform.
the vehicle sales industry is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully.
we face significant competition for the supply of salvage and other vehicles and for the buyers of those vehicles. we believe our principal competitors include other auction and vehicle remarketing service companies with whom we compete directly in obtaining vehicles from insurance companies and other sellers, and large vehicle dismantlers, who may buy salvage vehicles directly from insurance companies, bypassing the salvage sales process. many of the insurance companies have established relationships with competitive remarketing companies and large dismantlers. certain of our competitors may currently or in the future have greater financial resources than we do. due to the limited number of vehicle sellers, particularly in the u.k., and other foreign markets, the absence of long-term contractual commitments between us and our sellers and the increasingly competitive market environment, there can be no assurance that our competitors will not gain market share at our expense.
we may also encounter significant competition for local, regional, and national supply agreements with vehicle sellers. there can be no assurance that the existence of other local, regional, or national contracts entered into by our competitors will not have a material adverse effect on our business or our expansion plans. furthermore, we are likely to face competition from major competitors in the acquisition of vehicle storage facilities, which could significantly increase the cost of such acquisitions and thereby materially impede our expansion objectives or have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. these potential new competitors may include consolidators of automobile dismantling businesses, organized salvage vehicle buying groups, automobile manufacturers, automobile auctioneers and software companies. while most vehicle sellers have abandoned or reduced efforts to sell salvage vehicles directly without the use of service providers such as us, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue, which could adversely affect our market share, consolidated results of operations and financial position. additionally, existing or new competitors may be significantly larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than us; therefore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future.
risks related to regulatory compliance and legal matters our business activities and public policy interests expose us to political, regulatory, economic, and reputational risks.
our business activities, facilities expansions, and civic and public policy interests may be unpopular in certain communities, exposing us to reputational and political risk. for example, public opposition in some communities to different aspects of our business operations has impacted our ability to obtain required business use permits. additionally, our interests in legislative and regulatory processes at different levels of government in the geographies in which we operate have been opposed by competitors and other interest groups. although we believe we generally enjoy positive community relationships and political support in our range of operations, shifting public opinion sentiments and sociopolitical dynamics could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.
our operations and acquisitions in the u.s. and certain foreign areas expose us to political, regulatory, economic, and reputational risks.
although we have implemented policies, procedures, and training designed to ensure compliance with anti-bribery laws, trade controls and economic sanctions, and similar regulations, our employees or agents may take actions in violation of our policies. we may incur costs or other penalties in the event that any such violations occur, which could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.
in some cases, the enforcement practices of governmental regulators in certain foreign areas and the procedural and substantive rights and remedies available to us may vary significantly from those in the united states, which could have an adverse effect on our business.
although we face risks associated with international expansion in each of the non-u.s. markets where we operate, our current focus on the german market heightens the risks we face relating to our expansion plans in germany.
in addition, some of our recent acquisitions have required us to integrate non-u.s. companies which had not previously been subject to u.s. law. in many countries outside of the united states, particularly in those with developing economies, it may be common for persons to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act ("fcpa"), the u.k. bribery act, brazil clean companies act, india's prevention of corruption act, 1988 or similar local anti-bribery laws. these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees or agents from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. failure by us and our subsidiaries to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and financial position.
in addition, certain acquisitions in the u.k. may be reviewed by the cma. if an inquiry is made by the cma, we may be required to demonstrate that our acquisitions will not result, or be expected to result, in a substantial lessening of competition in the u.k. market. although we believe that there will not be a substantial lessening of competition in the u.k. market, based on our analysis of the relevant the u.k. markets, there can be no assurance that the cma will agree with us if it decides to make an inquiry. if the cma determines that by our acquisitions of certain assets, there is or likely will be a substantial lessening of competition in the u.k. market, we could be required to divest some portion of our u.k. assets. in the event of a divestiture order by the cma, the assets disposed may be sold for substantially less than their carrying value. accordingly, any divestiture could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the period of the divestiture.
we face risks associated with transacting on a principal rather than agent basis, which may have an adverse impact on our gross margin percentages and expose us to inventory risks.
certain of the vehicles that we remarket in the u.s. and foreign markets may be transacted either wholly or partially on the principal model, in which the vehicle is purchased and then resold for our own account, rather than the agency model, in which we generally act as a sales agent for the legal owner of vehicles. further, operating on a principal basis exposes us to inventory risks, including losses from theft, damage, and obsolescence. in addition, our business in the u.s., canada, and the u.k. has been established and grown based largely on our ability to build relationships with insurance carriers. in other markets, including germany, insurers have traditionally been less involved in the disposition of vehicles. as we expand into markets outside the u.s., canada, and the u.k., including germany in particular, we cannot predict whether markets will readily adapt to our strategy of online auctions of automobiles sourced principally through vehicle insurers. any failure of new markets to adopt our business model could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position.
acquisitions typically will increase our sales and profitability although, given the typical size of our acquisitions to date, most acquisitions will not individually have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. we may not always be able to introduce our processes and selling platform to acquired companies due to different operating models in international jurisdictions or other facts. as a result, the associated benefits of acquisitions may be delayed for years in some international situations. during this period, the acquisitions may operate at a loss and certain acquisitions, while profitable, may operate at a margin percentage that is below our overall operating margin percentage and, accordingly, have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. hence, the conversion periods vary from weeks to years and cannot be predicted.
our business is subject to a variety of domestic and international laws and other obligations regarding privacy and data protection.
we are subject to federal, state and international laws, directives, and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, disclosure, security, and transfer of personal data. these laws, directives, and regulations, and their interpretation and enforcement continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. for example, the general data protection regulation ("gdpr"), which went into effect in the european union on may 25, 2018, applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the european union and may also apply to related products and services that we offer to european union users. similarly, the california consumer privacy act, or ab375 ("ccpa"), the california privacy act ("cpra"), the colorado privacy act ("cpa"), the virginia consumer data protection act ("vcdpa") and the brazilian general data protection law ("lgpd"), were also recently enacted and became effective in 2020 and these laws create new data privacy rights for individuals. complying with the gdpr, the ccpa, the cpra, the cpa, the vcdpa, the lgpd, and similar emerging and changing privacy and data protection requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices. noncompliance with our legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection could result in penalties, legal proceedings by governmental entities or others, and significant legal and financial exposure and could affect our ability to retain and attract customers. any of the risks described above could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position.
regulation of the vehicle sales industry may impair our operations, increase our costs of doing business, and create potential liability.
participants in the vehicle sales industry are subject to, and may be required to expend funds to ensure compliance with a variety of laws, regulations, and ordinances. these include, without limitation, land use ordinances, business and occupational licensure requirements and procedures, vehicle titling, sales, and registration rules and procedures, and laws and regulations relating to the environment, anti-money laundering, anti-corruption, exporting, and reporting and notification requirements to agencies and law enforcement relating to vehicle transfers. many of these laws and regulations are frequently complex and subject to interpretation, and failure to comply with present or future regulations or changes in interpretations of existing laws or regulations may result in impairment or suspension of our operations and the imposition of penalties and other liabilities. at various times, we may be involved in disputes with local governmental officials regarding the development and/or operation of our business facilities. we may be subject to similar types of regulations by governmental agencies in new markets. in addition, new legal or regulatory requirements or changes in existing requirements may delay or increase the cost of opening new facilities, may limit our base of vehicle buyers, may decrease demand for our vehicles, and may adversely impact our ability to conduct business.
changes in laws or the interpretation of laws, including foreign laws and regulations, affecting the import and export of vehicles may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
our internet-based auction-style model has allowed us to offer our products and services to international markets and has increased our international buyer base. as a result, foreign importers of vehicles now represent a significant part of our total buyer base. as a result, our foreign buyers may be subject to a variety of foreign laws and regulations, including the imposition of import duties by foreign countries. changes in laws, regulations, and treaties that restrict or impede or negatively affect the economics surrounding the importation of vehicles into foreign countries may reduce the demand for vehicles and impact our ability to maintain or increase our international buyer base. in addition, we and our vehicle buyers must work with foreign customs agencies and other non-u.s. governmental officials, who are responsible for the interpretation, application, and enforcement of these laws, regulations, and treaties. any inability to obtain requisite approvals or agreements from such authorities could adversely impact the ability of our buyers to import vehicles into foreign countries. in addition, any disputes or disagreements with foreign agencies or officials over import duties, tariffs, or similar matters, including disagreements over the value assigned to imported vehicles, could adversely affect our costs and the ability and costs of our buyers to import vehicles into foreign countries. for example, in march 2008, a decree issued by the president of mexico became effective that placed restrictions on the types of vehicles that can be imported into mexico from the u.s. the adoption of similar laws or regulations in other jurisdictions that have the effect of reducing or curtailing our activities abroad, changes in the interpretation, application, and enforcement of laws, regulations, or treaties, any failure to comply with non-u.s. laws or regulatory interpretations, or any legal or regulatory interpretations or governmental actions that significantly increase our costs or the costs of our buyers could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position by reducing the demand for our products and services and our ability to compete in non-u.s. markets.
the operation of our storage facilities poses certain environmental risks, which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
our operations are subject to international, federal, provincial, state and local laws and regulations regarding the protection of the environment in the countries in which we have storage facilities. in some cases, we may acquire land with existing environmental issues, including landfills as an example. in the salvage vehicle remarketing industry, large numbers of wrecked vehicles are stored at storage facilities, requiring us to actively monitor and manage potential environmental impacts. in the u.k., we provide vehicle de-pollution and crushing services for end-of-life vehicles. we could incur substantial expenditures for preventative, investigative, or remedial action and could be exposed to liability arising from our operations, contamination by previous users of certain of our acquired facilities or facilities which we may acquire in the future, or the disposal of our waste at off-site locations. in addition to conducting environmental diligence on new site acquisitions, we also take such appropriate actions as may be necessary to avoid liability for activities of prior owners, and we have from time to time acquired insurance with respect to acquired facilities with known environmental risks. there can be no assurances, however, that these efforts to mitigate environmental risk will prove sufficient if we were to face material liabilities. we have incurred expenses for environmental remediation in the past, and environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time. there can be no assurance that we or our operations will not be subject to significant costs in the future or that environmental enforcement agencies at the state and federal level will not pursue enforcement actions against us. in addition to acquiring insurance in connection with certain acquisitions, we have also obtained indemnification for pre-existing environmental liabilities from many of the persons and entities from whom we have acquired facilities, but there can be no assurance that such indemnifications will be available or sufficient. any such expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
changes in federal, state and local, or foreign tax laws, changing interpretations of existing tax laws, or adverse determinations by tax authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations, and financial condition.
we are subject to taxation at the federal, state, provincial, and local levels in the u.s., the u.k., and various other countries and jurisdictions in which we operate, including income taxes, sales taxes, value-added ("vat") taxes, and similar taxes and assessments. the laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. although we believe our tax positions are reasonable, we are subject to audit by the internal revenue service, "irs", in the united states, hm revenue and customs in the united kingdom, state tax authorities in the states in which we operate, and other similar tax authorities in international jurisdictions. we have been subject to audits and challenges from applicable federal, state, or foreign tax authorities in the past, and may be subject to similar audits and challenges in the future. while we believe we comply with all applicable tax laws, rules, and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, tax authorities may elect to audit us and determine that we owe additional taxes, which could result in a significant increase in our liabilities for taxes, interest, and penalties in excess of our accrued liabilities.
new tax legislative initiatives may be proposed from time to time, such as proposals for comprehensive tax reform in the united states, which may impact our effective tax rate and which could adversely affect our tax positions or tax liabilities. our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes, changes in interpretations of existing tax laws, or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax. from time to time, u.s. federal, state and local, and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application, which could result in materially higher taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
for example, on august 16, 2022, the u.s. government enacted the inflation reduction act of 2022 which includes changes to the u.s. corporate income tax system, including a 15% minimum tax based on "adjusted financial statement income" for certain large corporations which will not be effective until fiscal year 2024 and a 1% excise tax on share repurchases after december 31, 2022. we are currently assessing the potential impact of these legislative changes.
risks related to our intellectual property and technology disruptions to our information technology systems, including failure to prevent outages, maintain security, and prevent unauthorized access to our information technology systems and other confidential information, could disrupt our business and materially and adversely affect our reputation, consolidated results of operations, and financial condition.
information availability and security risks for online commerce companies have significantly increased in recent years because of, in addition to other factors, the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, and other external parties. these threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of third parties or current or former employees. in addition, human error or accidental technological failure could make us vulnerable to information technology system disruptions and/or cyber-attacks, including the introduction of malicious computer viruses or code into our system, phishing attacks, ransomware attacks, or other cyber security incidents. for example, in march 2023 one of our immaterial subsidiaries suffered a ransomware attack. although the impacted subsidiary successfully maintained its operations during this event and the attack did not affect the rest of our business, future cyber-attacks could result in material adverse impacts to our business and our consolidated results of operations.
our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission, and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks. our customers and other parties in the payments value chain rely on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, and networks to conduct their operations. in addition, to access our products and services, our customers increasingly use personal smartphones, tablet pcs, and other mobile devices that may be beyond our control.
information technology system disruptions, cyber-attacks, ransomware attacks, or other cyber security incidents could materially and adversely affect our reputation, operating results, or financial condition by, among other things, making our auction platform inoperable for a period of time, damaging our reputation with buyers, sellers, and insurance companies as a result of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information (including account data information), or resulting in governmental investigations, litigation, liability, fines, or penalties against us. if such attacks are not detected immediately, their effect could be compounded. while we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of these cyber risks, an insurer may deny or exclude from coverage certain types of claims or our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses and would not remedy damage to our reputation.
we have in the past identified attempts by unauthorized third parties to access our systems and disrupt our online auctions. these attempts caused minor service interruptions, which were promptly addressed and resolved, and our online service was restored to normal business. however, any future such attempt may cause material service interruptions or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.
we regularly evaluate and implement new technologies and processes to manage risks relating to cyber-attacks and system and network disruptions, including but not limited to usage errors by our employees, power outages, and catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes. we have also enhanced our security protocols based on the investigation we conducted and in response to our prior attacks and service interruptions. nevertheless, we cannot provide assurances that our efforts to address cyber security incidents and mitigate against the risk of future cyber security incidents or system disruptions will be successful. the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and are often not recognized immediately. we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures and believe that cyber-attacks and threats against us have occurred in the past and are likely to continue in the future. if our systems are compromised, become inoperable for extended periods of time, or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and our ability to provide many of our electronic and online solutions to our customers may be impaired. in the event of another ransomware attack, we could suffer significant financial and reputational harm, regardless of whether we choose to pay the ransom amount. in addition, as cyber-threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. any of the risks described above could materially and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position.
our internet-based sales model has increased the relative importance of intellectual property assets to our business, and any inability to protect those rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial position.
our intellectual property rights include patents relating to our auction technologies, as well as trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights. in addition, we may enter into agreements with third parties regarding the license or other use of our intellectual property. effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed, deployed, or made available. we seek to maintain certain intellectual property rights as trade secrets. the secrecy could be compromised by third parties, or intentionally or accidentally by our employees, which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from those trade secrets. any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights, or any inability to protect our intellectual property rights, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position.
we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business. furthermore, regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.
we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require us to pay damages, and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.
litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights are common among companies who rely heavily on intellectual property rights. our reliance on intellectual property rights has increased significantly in recent years as we have implemented our auction-style sales technologies across our business and ceased conducting live auctions. recent u.s. supreme court precedent potentially restricts patentability of software inventions by affirming that patent claims merely requiring application of an abstract idea on standard computers utilizing generic computer functions are patent ineligible, which may impact our ability to enforce our issued patent and obtain new patents. as we face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us increases. litigation and any other intellectual property claims, whether with or without merit, can be time-consuming, expensive to litigate and settle, and can divert management resources and attention from our core business. an adverse determination in current or future litigation could prevent us from offering our products and services in the manner currently conducted. we may also have to pay damages or seek a license for the technology, which may not be available on reasonable terms and which may significantly increase our operating expenses, if it is available for us to license at all. we could also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense.
we have developed a proprietary enterprise operating system, and we may experience difficulties operating our business as we continue to design and develop this system.
we have developed a proprietary enterprise operating system to address our international expansion needs. the ongoing design, development, and implementation of our enterprise operating systems carries certain risks, including the risk of significant design or deployment errors causing disruptions, delays or deficiencies, which may make our website and services unavailable. this type of interruption could prevent us from processing vehicles for our sellers and may prevent us from selling vehicles through our internet bidding platform, vb3, which would adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position. in addition, the transition to our internally developed proprietary system will continue to require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources before the volume of business increases, without assurance that the volume of business will increase. we began using our internally developed proprietary system with our expansion into spain in fiscal 2016 and germany in fiscal 2017.
we may also implement additional or enhanced information systems in the future to accommodate our growth and to provide additional capabilities and functionality. the implementation of new systems and enhancements is frequently disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise and can be time-consuming and expensive, increase management responsibilities and divert management attention. any disruptions relating to our system enhancements or any problems with the implementation, particularly any disruptions impacting our operations or our ability to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis during the implementation period, could materially and adversely affect our business. even if we do not encounter these material and adverse effects, the implementation of these enhancements may be much more costly than we anticipated. if we are unable to successfully implement the information systems enhancements as planned, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be negatively impacted.
our success depends on maintaining the integrity of our systems and infrastructure. as our operations continue to grow in both size and scope, domestically and internationally, we must continue to provide reliable, real-time access to our systems by our customers through improving and upgrading our systems and infrastructure for enhanced products, services, features and functionality. any failure to maintain the integrity of our systems and infrastructure may result in loss of customers due, among other things, to slow delivery times, unreliable service levels, or insufficient capacity, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial position.
rapid technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the competitiveness of our services.
to remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our websites and software. the internet and the online commerce industry are rapidly changing. in particular, the online commerce industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures. if competitors introduce new services embodying new technologies or if new industry standards and practices emerge, our existing websites and proprietary technology and systems may become obsolete. our future success will depend on our ability to:
•    enhance our existing services;
•    develop, access, acquire, and license new services and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our current and prospective customers; and
•    respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices in a cost-effective and timely basis.
developing our websites and other proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks. we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our websites, transaction-processing systems, and network infrastructure to customer requirements or emerging industry standards. if we face material delays in introducing new services, products, and enhancements, our customers and suppliers may forego the use of our services and use those of our competitors.
risks related to ownership of our common stock our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate, causing the price of our stock to decline.
our revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. factors that may affect our operating results include, but are not limited to, the following:
•    fluctuations in the market value of salvage and used vehicles;
•    fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the per ton price of crushed car bodies;
•    the impact of foreign exchange gain and loss as a result of international operations;
•    our ability to successfully integrate our newly acquired operations in international markets and any additional markets we may enter;
•    the availability of salvage vehicles or other vehicles we sell including the supply of used and salvage vehicles in relation to the supply of new vehicle alternatives;
•    variations in vehicle accident rates;
•    variations in total loss frequency rates;
•    supply chain disruptions;
•    member participation in the internet bidding process;
•    delays or changes in state title processing;
•    changes in international, state or federal laws, regulations, or treaties affecting the vehicles we sell;
•    changes in the application, interpretation, and enforcement of existing laws, regulations or treaties;
•    trade disputes and other political, diplomatic, legal, or regulatory developments;
•    inconsistent application or enforcement of laws or regulations by regulators, governmental or quasi-governmental entities, or law enforcement or quasi-law enforcement agencies, as compared to our competitors;
•    changes in laws affecting who may purchase the vehicles we sell;
•    the timing and size of our new facility openings;
•    the announcement of new vehicle supply agreements by us or our competitors;
•    the severity of weather and seasonality of weather patterns;
•    the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations, and infrastructure;
•    the availability and cost of general business insurance;
•    labor costs and collective bargaining;
•    changes in the current levels of out of state and foreign demand for salvage vehicles;
•    the introduction of a similar internet product by a competitor;
•    the ability to obtain or maintain necessary permits to operate;
•    goodwill impairment;
•    crimes committed against us, including theft, forgery, and counterfeit payments;
•    military conflicts, including the russian invasion of ukraine;
•    bank failures;
•    natural and man-made disasters;
•    public health issues, including covid-19 and other pandemics;
•    monetary policy and potential inflation impacts, including any adverse effects of inflation on our cash reserves; and
•    political issues.
due to the foregoing factors, our operating results in one or more future periods can be expected to fluctuate. as a result, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance. in the event such fluctuations result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially.
we are partially self-insured for certain losses and if our estimates of the cost of future claims differ from actual trends, our results of operations could be harmed.
we are partially self-insured for certain losses related to our different lines of insurance coverage including, without limitation, medical insurance, general liability, workers' compensation, and auto liability. our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. further, we utilize independent actuaries to assist us in establishing the proper amount of reserves for anticipated payouts associated with these self-insured exposures. while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available, if actual trends, including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation, differ from our estimates, our results of operations could be impacted.
our executive officers, directors, and their affiliates hold a large percentage of our stock and their interests may differ from other stockholders.
our executive officers, directors and their affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, more than 10% of our issued and outstanding common stock as of july 31, 2023. if they were to act together, these stockholders would have significant influence over most matters requiring approval by stockholders, including the election of directors, any amendments to our certificate of incorporation and certain significant corporate transactions, including potential merger or acquisition transactions. in addition, without the consent of these stockholders, we could be delayed or prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us or our other investors. these stockholders may take these actions even if they are opposed by our other investors.
we have certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws which may have an anti-takeover effect or that may delay, defer or prevent acquisition bids for us that a stockholder might consider favorable and limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.
our board of directors is authorized to create and issue from time to time, without stockholder approval, up to an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock. in addition, our bylaws establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. these anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions the stockholders desire.
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the court of chancery of the state of delaware as the exclusive forum for certain disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws, or (iv) any action or proceeding asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, shall be the court of chancery of the state of delaware.
this provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, for which the u.s. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction, or the securities act of 1933, as amended.
any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding or owning (or continuing to hold or own) any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions. although we believe this exclusive forum provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, the exclusive forum provision may (i) increase the costs for a stockholder, and/or (ii) limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees, stockholders, or others which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder as a result of our exclusive forum provision. further, in the event a court finds the exclusive forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be unenforceable or inapplicable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our results of operations.
general risk factors cash investments are subject to risks.
we may invest our excess cash in securities or money market funds backed by securities, which may include u.s. treasuries, other federal, state and municipal debt, bonds, preferred stock, commercial paper, insurance contracts and other securities both privately and publicly traded. all securities are subject to risk, including fluctuations in interest rates, credit risk, market risk, and systemic economic risk. changes or movements in any of these investment-related risk items may result in a loss or impairment to our invested cash and may have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position.
macroeconomic factors such as high fuel prices, declines in commodity prices, fluctuations in used car prices, and vehicle-related technological advances may have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results, as well as our earnings growth rates.
macroeconomic factors that affect oil prices and the automobile and commodity markets can have adverse effects on our revenues, revenue growth rates (if any), and operating results. significant increases in the cost of fuel could lead to a reduction in miles driven per car and a reduction in accident rates. a material reduction in accident rates, whether due to, among other things, a reduction in miles driven per car, vehicle-related technological advances such as accident avoidance systems and, to the extent widely adopted, the advent of autonomous vehicles, could have a material impact on revenue growth. similarly, a reduction in total loss frequency rates, due to among other things, sharp increases in used car prices that make it less economical for insurance company sellers to declare a vehicle involved in an accident a total loss, could also have a material impact on revenue growth. in addition, under our percentage incentive program contracts, which we refer to as pip, the cost of transporting the vehicle to one of our facilities is included in the pip fee. we may incur increased fees, which we may not be able to pass on to our vehicle sellers. a material increase in transportation rates could have a material impact on our operating results. volatility in fuel, commodity, and used car prices could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and revenue growth rates in future periods.
adverse u.s. and international economic conditions may negatively affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
the capital and credit markets have historically experienced extreme volatility and disruption, which has in the past and may in the future lead to economic downturns in the u.s. and abroad. as a result of any economic downturn, the number of miles driven may decrease, which may lead to fewer accident claims, a reduction of vehicle repairs, and fewer salvage vehicles. increases in unemployment, as a result of any economic downturn, may lead to an increase in the number of uninsured motorists. uninsured motorists are responsible for disposition of their vehicle if involved in an accident. disposition generally is either the repair or disposal of the vehicle. in the situation where the owner of the wrecked vehicle, and not an insurance company, is responsible for its disposition, we believe it is more likely that vehicle will be repaired or, if disposed, disposed through channels other than us. adverse credit markets may also affect the ability of members to secure financing to purchase salvaged vehicles which may adversely affect demand. in addition, if the banking system or the financial markets deteriorate or are volatile, our credit facility or our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing may be affected. these adverse economic conditions and events may have a negative effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and financial position.
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported revenues and earnings.
our reported revenues and earnings are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. we do not engage in foreign currency hedging arrangements; consequently, foreign currency fluctuations may adversely affect our revenues and earnings. should we choose to engage in hedging activities in the future we cannot be assured our hedges will be effective or that the costs of the hedges will not exceed their benefits. fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies, primarily the british pound, canadian dollar, brazilian real, european union euro, u.a.e. dirham, omani rial, and bahraini dinar could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position.

overview we are a leading global provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services with operations in the united states ("u.s."), canada, the united kingdom ("u.k."), brazil, the republic of ireland, germany, finland, the united arab emirates ("u.a.e."), oman, bahrain, and spain.
our goals are to generate sustainable profits for our stockholders, while also providing environmental and social benefits for the world around us. with respect to our environmental stewardship, we believe our business is a critical enabler for the global re-use and recycling of vehicles, parts, and raw materials. we are not responsible for the carbon emissions resulting from new vehicle manufacturing, governmental fuel emissions standards or vehicle use by consumers. each vehicle that enters our business operations already exists, with whatever fuel technology and efficiency it was designed and built to have, and the substantial carbon emissions associated with the vehicle's manufacture have already occurred. however, upon our receipt of an existing vehicle, we help decrease its total environmental impact by extending its useful life and thereby avoiding the carbon emissions associated with the alternative of new vehicle and auto parts manufacturing. for example, many of the cars we process and remarket are subsequently restored to driveable condition, reducing the new vehicle manufacturing burden the world would otherwise face. many of our cars are purchased by dismantlers, who recycle and refurbish parts for vehicle repairs, again reducing new and aftermarket parts manufacturing. and finally, some of our vehicles are returned to their raw material inputs through scrapping, reducing the need for further new resource extraction. in each of these cases, our business reduces the carbon and other environmental footprint of the global transportation industry.
beyond our environmental stewardship, we also support the world's communities in two important ways. first, we believe that we contribute to economic development and well-being by enabling more affordable access to mobility around the world. for example, many of the automobiles sold through our auction platform are purchased for use in developing countries where affordable transportation is a critical enabler of education, health care, and well-being more generally. secondly, because of the special role we play in responding to catastrophic weather events, we believe we contribute to disaster recovery and resilience in the communities we serve. for example, we mobilized our people, entered into emergency leases, and engaged with a multitude of service providers to timely retrieve, store, and remarket tens of thousands of flood-damaged vehicles in south florida in the wake of hurricane ian in the fall of 2022.
we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding third generation internet auction-style sales technology, which we refer to as vb3. vehicle sellers consist primarily of insurance companies, but also include banks, finance companies, charities, fleet operators, dealers, vehicle rental companies, and individuals. we sell the vehicles principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers, rebuilders, repair licensees, used vehicle dealers, exporters, and to the general public. the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss; not economically repairable by the insurance companies; or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made. we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that help expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process, minimize administrative and processing costs, and maximize the ultimate sales price through the online auction process.
in the u.s., canada, brazil, the republic of ireland, finland, the u.a.e., oman, and bahrain, we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from auction and auction related sales transaction fees charged for vehicle remarketing services as well as fees for services subsequent to the auction, such as delivery and storage. in the u.k., germany, and spain we operate both as an agent and on a principal basis, in some cases purchasing salvage vehicles outright and reselling the vehicles for our own account. in germany and spain, we also derive revenue from listing vehicles on behalf of insurance companies and insurance experts to determine the vehicle's residual value and/or to facilitate a sale for the insured.
we monitor and analyze a number of key financial performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance. such indicators include:
service and vehicle sales revenue: our service revenue consists of auction and auction related sales transaction fees charged for vehicle remarketing services. these auction and auction related services may include a combination of vehicle purchasing fees, vehicle listing fees, and vehicle selling fees that can be based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price, tiered vehicle sales price driven fees, or at a fixed fee based on the sale of each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle; transportation fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to or from our facility; title processing and preparation fees; vehicle storage fees; bidding fees; and vehicle loading fees. these fees are recognized as net revenue (not gross vehicle selling price) at the time of auction in the amount of such fees charged. purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicles which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own. we have certain contracts with insurance companies, primarily in the u.k., in which we act as a principal, purchasing vehicles and reselling them for our own account. we also purchase vehicles in the open market, primarily from individuals, and resell them for our own account.
our revenue is impacted by several factors, including total loss frequency and the average vehicle auction selling price, as a significant amount of our service revenue is associated in some manner with the ultimate selling price of the vehicle. vehicle auction selling prices are driven primarily by: (i) market demand for rebuildable, driveable vehicles; (ii) used car pricing, which we also believe has an impact on total loss frequency; (iii) end market demand for recycled and refurbished parts as reflected in demand from dismantlers; (iv) the mix of cars sold; (v) changes in the u.s. dollar exchange rate to foreign currencies, which we believe has an impact on auction participation by international buyers; and; (vi) changes in commodity prices, particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies, as we believe this has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling. we cannot specifically quantify the financial impact that commodity pricing, used car pricing, and product sales mix has on the selling price of vehicles, our service revenues, or financial results. total loss frequency is the percentage of cars involved in accidents that insurance companies salvage rather than repair and is driven by the relationship between repair costs, used car values, and auction returns. over the past 30 years we believe there has been an increase in overall growth in the salvage market driven by an increase in total loss frequency. this increase in total loss frequency may have been driven by changes in used car values and repair costs over the same long-term horizon, which we believe are generally trending upward. recently we have noted fluctuations in total loss frequency. nonetheless, we believe the long-term trend of increases in total loss frequency will continue. in the near term changes in used car prices and repair cost, are inversely related but may impact total loss frequency and thereby affect our growth rate. used car values are determined by many factors, including used car supply, which is tied directly to new car sales, and the average age of cars on the road. the average age of cars on the road has continued to increase, growing from 9.7 years in 2003 to 12.5 years in 2023. repair costs are generally based on damage severity, vehicle complexity, repair parts availability, repair parts costs, labor costs, and repair shop lead times. the factors that can influence repair costs, used car pricing, and auction returns are many and varied and we cannot predict their movements with precision.
operating costs and expenses: yard operations expenses consist primarily of operating personnel (which includes yard management, clerical, and yard employees); rent; vehicle transportation; insurance; property related taxes; fuel; equipment maintenance and repair; marketing costs directly related to the auction process; and costs of vehicles sold under the purchase contracts. general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management; accounting; data processing; sales personnel; professional services; marketing expenses; and system maintenance and enhancements.
other income (expense): other income (expense) consists primarily of interest income on treasury bills, interest expense on long-term debt, see notes to consolidated financial statements, note 9 - long-term debt; foreign exchange rate gains and losses; gains and losses from the disposal of assets, which will fluctuate based on the nature of these activities each period; and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates.
liquidity and cash flows: our primary source of working capital is cash operating results and debt financing. the primary source of our liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents and revolving loan facility. the primary factors affecting cash operating results are: (i) seasonality; (ii) market wins and losses; (iii) supplier mix; (iv) accident frequency; (v) total loss frequency; (vi) volume from our existing suppliers; (vii) commodity pricing; (viii) used car pricing; (ix) foreign currency exchange rates; (x) product mix; (xi) contract mix to the extent applicable; (xii) our capital expenditures; and (xiii) other macroeconomic factors. these factors are further discussed in the results of operations and risk factors sections of this annual report on form 10-k.
potential internal sources of additional working capital and liquidity are the sale of assets or the issuance of shares through option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan. a potential external source of additional working capital and liquidity is the issuance of additional debt or equity. however, we cannot predict if these sources will be available in the future or on commercially acceptable terms.
acquisitions and new operations as part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated services to vehicle sellers, we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions, as well as the regions currently served by our facilities. we believe that these acquisitions and openings will strengthen our coverage, as we have facilities located in the u.s., canada, the u.k., brazil, the republic of ireland, germany, finland, the u.a.e., oman, bahrain, and spain with the intention of providing global coverage for our sellers. all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.

the period-to-period comparability of our consolidated operating results and financial position is affected by business acquisitions, new openings, weather, and product introductions during such periods.
in addition to growth through business acquisitions, we seek to increase revenues and profitability by, among other things, (i) acquiring and developing additional vehicle storage facilities in key markets, including foreign markets; (ii) pursuing global, national, and regional vehicle seller agreements; (iii) increasing our service offerings; and (iv) expanding the application of vb3 into new markets. in addition, we implement our pricing structure and auction procedures, and attempt to introduce cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures, integrating our management information systems, and redeploying personnel, when necessary.

service revenues. the increase in service revenues for fiscal 2023 of $345.1 million, or 12.1% as compared to fiscal 2022 came from (i) an increase in the u.s. of $308.5 million, and (ii) an increase in international of $36.6 million. the growth in the u.s. was driven primarily by (i) an increase in revenue per car due to higher auction selling prices, which we believe is due to a change in mix of vehicles sold and restrictions within the global supply chain for automobiles and (ii) an increase in volume. the growth in international, excluding the unfavorable impact of $22.6 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily from the change in the european union euro, canadian dollar and british pound to u.s. dollar exchange rates, netting against a favorable impact of the brazilian real to the u.s. dollar exchange rate, was driven primarily by an increase in revenue per car due to a change in mix of vehicles sold and an increase in volume.

yard operations expenses. the increase in yard operations expenses for fiscal 2023 of $208.5 million, or 15.9% as compared to fiscal 2022 resulted from (i) an increase in the u.s. of $168.5 million, and (ii) an increase in international of $40.0 million. excluding depreciation and amortization, the increase in the u.s. compared to the same period last year relates to an increase in the cost to process each car combined with an increase in volume. the increase in cost to process each car was driven by increased subhaul costs primarily related to the fluctuation of fuel costs, and labor costs, combined with an increase in premiums for catastrophic related subhaul, labor costs incurred from overtime, and increased travel and lodging associated with hurricane ian. the increase in international, excluding a favorable impact of $12.1 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily from the favorable change in the european union euro, canadian dollar and british pound to u.s. dollar exchange rate offset by an unfavorable change in the brazilian real to u.s. dollar exchange rate, was primarily due to an increase in the cost to process each car which is driven by an increase in subhaul, fuel and labor costs combined with an increase in volume. included in yard operations expenses were depreciation and amortization expenses which increased year over year due to the depreciation of new and expanded facilities placed into service in u.s. and international locations.

general and administrative expenses. the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2023 of $19.2 million, or 8.3% as compared to fiscal 2022 came primarily from (i) an increase in the u.s. of $9.6 million, and (ii) an increase in international of $9.6 million. excluding depreciation and amortization, the increase in the u.s. of $12.2 million resulted from increases in, labor costs, outside services and travel costs offset by a decrease in legal costs. the increase in international, excluding a favorable impact of $2.7 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily from the favorable change in the european union euro, canadian dollar and british pound to u.s. dollar exchange rate offset by an unfavorable change in the brazilian real to u.s. dollar exchange rate, resulted from increases in stock compensation, labor costs, legal costs, travel costs, and marketing costs. the decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses resulted primarily from fully depreciating certain intangible and technology assets in the u.s. and international locations.

other expenses. the increase in total other income for fiscal 2023 of $101.8 million, or 299.0% as compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily due to higher interest income earned from treasury bills, realized and unrealized foreign currency gains, net against a decrease in interest expense and decrease of extinguishment of debt offset by losses from equity method investments.
income taxes. our effective income tax rates were 20.4% and 18.7%, for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. the current and prior year's effective tax rate was computed based on the u.s. federal statutory tax rate of 21.0%. the effective tax rate for fiscal year ending july 31, 2023 was favorably impacted by $1.5 million of discrete tax adjustments made in connection with finalizing our fiscal year 2022 tax return. the effective tax rate for fiscal year ending july 31, 2022 was unfavorably impacted by $8.2 million of discrete tax adjustments made in connection with finalizing our fiscal year 2021 tax return and favorably impacted by $17.0 million of discrete tax items related to amending previously filed income tax returns. the effective tax rates in the current and prior year were also impacted by the recognition of excess tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options of $21.0 million and $14.3 million for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively.

cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash decreased $426.8 million and working capital increased $1,008.3 million at july 31, 2023, as compared to july 31, 2022. cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash decreased primarily due to the purchase of held to maturity securities of $1,406.6 million as at july 31, 2023, offset by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises. working capital increased primarily from cash generated from operations and timing of cash receipts and payments, partially offset by capital expenditures and certain income tax benefits related to stock option exercises and timing of cash payments. cash equivalents consisted of bank deposits, certificates of deposit, u.s. treasury bills, and funds invested in money market accounts, which bear interest at variable rates.
historically, we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations, public offerings of common stock, equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions, and debt financing. our primary source of cash generated by operations is from the collection of service fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of vehicle sales. we expect to continue to use cash flows from operations to finance our working capital needs and to develop and grow our business. in addition to our stock repurchase program, we are considering a variety of alternative potential uses for our remaining cash balances and our cash flows from operations. these alternative potential uses include additional stock repurchases, the payment of dividends, and acquisitions. for further detail, see notes to consolidated financial statements, note 9 - long-term debt and note 12 - stockholders' equity and under the subheadings "credit agreement" below.
our business is seasonal as inclement weather during the winter months increases the frequency of accidents and consequently, the number of cars involved in accidents which the insurance companies salvage rather than repair. during the winter months, most of our facilities process 5% to 20% more vehicles than at other times of the year. severe weather events, including but not limited to tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, and hailstorms, can also impact our volumes. these increased volumes require the increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business.
we believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital requirements in the foreseeable future. we expect to acquire or develop additional locations and expand some of our current facilities in the foreseeable future. we may be required to raise additional cash through drawdowns on our revolving loan facility or issuance of additional equity to fund this expansion. although the timing and magnitude of growth through expansion and acquisitions are not predictable, the opening of new greenfield yards is contingent upon our ability to locate property that (i) is in an area in which we have a need for more capacity; (ii) has adequate size given the capacity needs; (iii) has the appropriate shape and topography for our operations; (iv) is reasonably close to a major road or highway; and (v) most importantly, has the appropriate zoning for our business.
as of july 31, 2023, $145.5 million of the $957.4 million of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries. if these funds are needed for our operations in the u.s., the repatriation of these funds could still be subject to the foreign withholding tax following the u.s. tax reform. however, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the u.s. and our current plans do not require repatriation to fund our u.s. operations.
net cash provided by operating activities increased for fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 due to improved cash operating results primarily from an increase in service and vehicle sales revenues, partially offset by an increase in yard operations and general and administrative expenses, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. the change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of an increase in funds received in income tax receivable of $63.1 million, inventory of $37.4 million, deferred revenue of $6.5 million and income tax payable of $21.8 million, partially offset by accounts receivable of $25.5 million, accounts payable of $18.3 million, and vehicle pooling costs of $7.4 million.
net cash used in investing activities increased for fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 due primarily to the purchase of held to maturity securities and an increase in capital expenditures net against proceeds from the sale of assets. our capital expenditures are primarily related to acquiring land, opening and improving facilities, capitalized software development costs for new software for internal use and major software enhancements, acquiring yard equipment, and lease buyouts of certain facilities. we continue to develop, expand, and invest in new and existing facilities and standardize the appearance of existing locations. as of the year ended july 31, 2023, we have no material non-cancelable commitments for future capital expenditures.
net cash provided by (used in) financing activities changed from a use of cash to providing cash in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 due primarily to an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and a reduction in principal payments on long term debt as discussed in further detail in the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 12 - stockholders' equity.
for a discussion of fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021, please refer to part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our form 10-k for the fiscal year ended july 31, 2022, filed with the sec on september 27, 2022.
stock repurchases on september 22, 2011, our board of directors approved a 320 million share increase in the stock repurchase program, bringing the total current authorization to 784 million shares. the repurchases may be effected through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. no time limit has been placed on the duration of the stock repurchase program. subject to applicable securities laws, such repurchases will be made at such times and in such amounts as we deem appropriate and may be discontinued at any time. for fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under the program. as of july 31, 2023, the total number of shares repurchased to date under the program was 458,196,792, and subject to applicable limitations under delaware law, 325,803,208 shares were available for repurchase under our program.
in fiscal 2021, certain employees exercised stock options through a cashless exercise. in fiscal 2022 and 2023, no employees exercised stock options through a cashless exercise. a portion of the options exercised were net settled in satisfaction of the exercise price. we remitted $0.0 million, $0.0 million, and $3.8 million during the years ended july 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, to the proper taxing authorities in satisfaction of the employees' statutory withholding requirements.

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we consider the following policies to be the most critical to understanding the judgments that are involved and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. for additional information, see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in part i., item i., "financial statements."
revenue recognition our primary performance obligation is the auctioning of consigned vehicles through an online auction process. service revenue and vehicle sales revenue are recognized at the date the vehicles are sold at auction, excluding annual registration fees. costs to prepare the vehicles for auction, including inbound transportation costs and titling fees, are deferred and recognized at the time of revenue recognition at auction.
our disaggregation between service revenues and vehicle sales at the segment level reflects how the nature, timing, amount, and uncertainty of our revenues and cash flows are impacted by economic factors. we report sales taxes on relevant transactions on a net basis in our consolidated results of operations, and therefore do not include sales taxes in revenues or costs.
service revenues our service revenue consists of auction and auction related sales transaction fees charged for vehicle remarketing services. within this revenue category, our primary performance obligation is the auctioning of consigned vehicles through an online auction process. these auction and auction related services may include a combination of vehicle purchasing fees, vehicle listing fees, and vehicle selling fees that can be based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price, tiered vehicle sales price driven fees, or at a fixed fee based on the sale of each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle; transportation fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to or from our facility; title processing and preparation fees; vehicle storage fees; bidding fees; and vehicle loading fees. these services are not distinct within the context of the contract. accordingly, revenue for these services is recognized when the single performance obligation is satisfied at the completion of the auction process. we do not take ownership of these consigned vehicles which are stored at our facilities located throughout the u.s. and international locations. these fees are recognized as net revenue (not gross vehicle selling price) at the time of auction in the amount of such fees charged.
we have a separate performance obligation related to providing access to our online auction platform. we charge members an annual registration fee for the right to participate in our online auctions and access our bidding platform. this fee is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, generally one year, as each day of access to the online auction platform represents the best depiction of the transfer of the service.
no provision for returns has been established, as all sales are final with no right of return or warranty, although we provide for expected credit losses in the case of non-performance by our buyers or sellers.

contract assets we capitalize certain contract assets related to obtaining a contract, where the amortization period for the related asset is greater than one year. these assets are amortized over the expected life of the customer relationship. contract assets are classified as current or long-term other assets, based on the timing of when we expect to recognize the related revenues and are amortized as an offset to the associated revenues on a straight-line basis. we assess these costs for impairment at least quarterly and as "triggering" events occur that indicate it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. the contract asset costs where the amortization period for the related asset is one year or less are expensed as incurred and recorded within general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
income taxes in determining net income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities.
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the tax rates and laws enacted at the time of such determination. we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and implementation of tax planning strategies. changes in our assumptions could cause an increase or decrease to the valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate.
we recognize liabilities when we determine a tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. we use significant judgment in determining whether a tax position's technical merits are more likely than not to be sustained and in measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. we recognize penalties and interest accrued related to income taxes as a component of the provision for income taxes. although we believe the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals.
we recognize liabilities, if any, related to global low-taxed intangible income ("gilti") in the year in which the liability arises and not as a deferred tax liability.
recently issued accounting standards for a description of the new accounting standards that affect us, refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements, note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies.

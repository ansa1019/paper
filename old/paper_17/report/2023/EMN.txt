eastman has exposure to various market risks principally due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the pricing of various commodities, and interest rates. in an effort to manage these risks, the company employs various strategies, including pricing, inventory management, and hedging. the company enters into derivative contracts which are governed by policies, procedures, and internal processes set forth by its board of directors.
the company determines its exposures to market risk by utilizing sensitivity analyses, which measure the potential losses in fair value resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, or interest rates.
foreign currency risk due to a portion of the company's operating cash flows and borrowings being denominated in foreign currencies, the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. the company continually evaluates its foreign currency exposure based on current market conditions and the locations in which the company conducts business. the company manages most foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the company to net certain exposures and take advantage of natural offsets. to mitigate foreign currency risk, from time to time, the company enters into derivative instruments to hedge the cash flows related to certain sales and purchase transactions expected within a rolling three year period and denominated in foreign currencies, and enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of related exposures. additionally, the company, from time to time, enters into non-derivative and derivative instruments to hedge the foreign currency exposure of the net investment in certain foreign operations. the foreign currency change in the designated investment values of the foreign subsidiaries will generally be offset by a foreign currency change in the carrying value of the euro-
denominated borrowings. it is the company's policy to enter into foreign currency derivative and non-derivative instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. the company does not enter into foreign currency derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
at december 31, 2023, the market risk associated with certain cash flows under these derivative transactions assuming a 10 percent adverse move in the u.s. dollar relative to these foreign currencies was $43 million, with an additional $4 million exposure for each additional one percentage point adverse change in those foreign currency rates. since the company utilizes currency-sensitive derivative instruments for hedging anticipated foreign currency transactions, a loss in fair value from those instruments is generally offset by an increase in the value of the underlying anticipated transactions.
at december 31, 2023, a 10 percent fluctuation in the euro and japanese yen currency rates would have had an impact of $205 million and $5 million, respectively, on the designated net investment values in the foreign subsidiaries.
as a result of the designation of the euro-denominated borrowings and designated cross-currency interest rate swaps as hedges of the net investments, foreign currency translation gains and losses on the borrowings and designated cross-currency interest rate swaps are recorded as a component of the "change in cumulative translation adjustment"
within "other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax" in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings in part ii, item 8 of this annual report. therefore, a foreign currency change in the designated investment values of the foreign subsidiaries will generally be offset by a foreign currency change in the carrying value of the euro-denominated borrowings or the foreign currency change in the designated cross-
currency interest rate swaps.
commodity risk the company is exposed to fluctuations in market prices for certain of its raw materials and energy, as well as contract sales of certain commodity products. to mitigate short-term fluctuations in market prices for certain commodities, principally propane, ethane, natural gas, paraxylene, ethylene, and benzene, as well as selling prices for ethylene, the company enters into derivative transactions, from time to time, to hedge the cash flows related to certain sales and purchase transactions expected within a rolling three year period. at december 31, 2023, the market risk associated with these derivative contracts, assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of 10 percent and no corresponding change in the selling price of finished goods, was $4 million, with an additional $400 thousand of exposure at december 31, 2023 for each one percentage point move in closing price thereafter.

interest rate risk eastman is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities, which include long-term borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund its business operations and capital requirements. the nature and amount of the company's long-term and short-term debt may vary from time to time as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. the company manages global interest rate exposure as part of regular operational and financing strategies. the company had $799 million variable interest rate borrowings at december 31, 2023.
eastman may enter into interest rate swaps, collars, or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to the company's borrowing costs. as of december 31, 2023, the company had interest rate swaps outstanding with notional values of $75 million. for purposes of calculating the market risks associated with the fair value of interest-rate-sensitive instruments, the company uses a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates. the corresponding market risk of the interest rate swap hedging the interest rate risk on the 3.8%
bonds maturing march 2025 was $6 million as of december 31, 2023.

report of independent registered public accounting firm to the board of directors and stockholders of eastman chemical company opinions on the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting we have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of eastman chemical company and its subsidiaries (the "company") as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings, and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). we also have audited the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2023, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso).
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. also in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2023, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the coso.
basis for opinions the company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in management's report on internal control over financial reporting appearing under item 9a. our responsibility is to express opinions on the company's consolidated financial statements and on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob) and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

critical audit matters the critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i)
relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
annual goodwill impairment assessments - certain reporting units in the additives & functional products segment as described in notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the company's consolidated goodwill balance was $3,646 million as of december 31, 2023, and the goodwill associated with the additives & functional products segment was $2,182 million. management conducts testing of goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. management uses an income approach, specifically a discounted cash flow model, when a quantitative analysis is used in testing the carrying value of goodwill of a reporting unit for impairment. as disclosed by management, key assumptions and estimates used in the company's goodwill impairment testing included projections of revenues and earnings before interest and taxes (ebit), the estimated weighted average cost of capital (wacc) and a projected long-term growth rate.
the principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessments for certain reporting units in the additives & functional products segment is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the reporting units; (ii)
a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's significant assumptions related to projections of revenues and ebit, the estimated wacc, and the projected long-
term growth rate; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.
addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. these procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's goodwill impairment assessments, including controls over the valuation of certain reporting units in the additives & functional products segment. these procedures also included, among others (i)
testing management's process for developing the fair value estimate of certain reporting units in the additives &
functional products segment, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the model, and (iv) evaluating the significant assumptions used by management related to projections of revenues and ebit, the estimated wacc, and the projected long-term growth rate. evaluating management's assumptions related to projections of revenues and ebit and the projected long- term growth rate involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting units, (ii) the consistency with external industry reports, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the company's discounted cash flow model and (ii) the reasonableness of the estimated wacc assumption.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements
1.
significant accounting policies financial statement presentation the consolidated financial statements of eastman chemical company ("eastman" or the "company") and subsidiaries are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted ("gaap") in the united states and of necessity include some amounts that are based upon management estimates and judgments. future actual results could differ from such current estimates. the consolidated financial statements include assets, liabilities, sales revenue, and expenses of all majority-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in which a controlling interest is maintained.
eastman accounts for other joint ventures and investments in minority-owned companies where it exercises significant influence on the equity basis. intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.
certain prior period data has been reclassified in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes to conform to current period presentation, including sales revenue, earnings before interest and taxes ("ebit"), assets, depreciation and amortization expense, and capital expenditures related to the product moves announced in first quarter 2023. see note 5, "goodwill and other intangible assets", and note 20, "segment and regional sales information", for more information.
recently adopted accounting standards accounting standards update ("asu") 2021-08 business combinations (topic 805): accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers : on january 1, 2023, eastman adopted prospectively this update, which requires that an entity (acquirer) recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers , as if it had originated the contracts. the adoption did not have a significant impact on the company's financial statements and related disclosures.
asu 2022-01 derivatives and hedging (topic 815): fair value hedging-portfolio layer method : on january 1, 2023, eastman adopted this update which clarifies the guidance in accounting standards codification ("asc") 815 on fair value hedge accounting of interest rate risk for portfolios of financial assets. this asu amends the guidance in asu 2017-12 (released on august 28, 2017) that, among other things, established the "last-of-layer" method for making the fair value hedge accounting for these portfolios more accessible. asu 2022-01 renames that method the
"portfolio layer" method and addresses feedback from stakeholders regarding its application. the adoption did not have a significant impact on the company's financial statements and related disclosures.
asu 2022-02 financial instruments-credit losses (topic 326): troubled debt restructurings and vintage disclosures :
on january 1, 2023, eastman adopted this update which amends the requirements for accounting for credit losses under asc 326, eliminates the accounting guidance on troubled debt restructurings for creditors in asc 310-40, and enhances creditors' disclosure requirements related to loan refinancings and restructurings for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. this asu also amends the guidance on "vintage disclosures" to require disclosure of gross write-offs by year of origination. the adoption did not have a significant impact on the company's financial statements and related disclosures.
asu 2022-04 liabilities - supplier finance programs (subtopic 405-50): disclosure of supplier finance program obligations : on january 1, 2023, eastman adopted this update which requires the buyer in a supplier finance program to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about the program. required disclosures include information about the key terms of the program, outstanding confirmed amounts as of the end of the period, a rollforward of such amounts during each annual period, and a description of where in the financial statements outstanding amounts are presented. this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the disclosure of rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. the adoption did not have a significant impact on the company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. the required disclosures are included as part of "working capital management and off balance sheet arrangements" disclosure below.
65
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements accounting standards issued but not adopted as of december 31, 2023
asu 2022-03 fair value measurement (topic 820): fair value measurement of equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions : the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued this update in june 2022, which states that when measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, a reporting entity should consider the characteristics of the asset or liability, including restrictions on the sale of the asset or liability, if a market participant also would take those characteristics into account. key to that determination is the unit of account for the asset or liability being measured at fair value. this asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. management does not expect that changes required by the new standard will have a significant impact on the company's financial statements and related disclosures.
asu 2023-05 business combination - joint venture formations (subtopic 805-60): recognition and initial measurement
: the fasb issued this update in august 2023, which states that a joint venture must initially measure all contributions received upon its formation at fair value, largely consistent with topic 805, business combinations.
the guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice and provide users of joint venture financial statements with more decision-useful information. this asu should be applied prospectively and is effective for all newly formed joint venture entities with a formation date on or after january 1, 2025. early adoption is permitted, and joint ventures formed prior to the adoption date may elect to apply the new guidance retrospectively back to their original formation date. management is currently evaluating the impact on the company's financial statements and related disclosures.
asu 2023-07 segment reporting (topic 280): improvements to reportable segment disclosures : the fasb issued this update in november 2023, which requires enhanced disclosures regarding significant segment expenses and other segment items for public entities on both an annual and interim basis. specifically, the update mandates that entities provide, during interim periods, all disclosures related to a reportable segment's profit or loss and assets that were previously required only on an annual basis. additionally, this guidance necessitates the disclosure of the title and position of the chief operating decision maker ("codm"). importantly, the new guidance does not modify how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates them, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after december
15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years starting after december 15, 2024. this asu must be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented. management is currently evaluating the impact of the changes required by the new standard on the company's financial statements and related disclosures.
asu 2023-09 income taxes (topic 740): improvements to income tax disclosures : the fasb issued this update in december 2023, which modifies income tax disclosure requirements. the updated guidance mandates entities to provide more detailed information including specific categories in the income tax rate reconciliation, and the breakdown of income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense or benefit, for both domestic and foreign.
additionally, entities must disclose income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations, categorized by federal, state, and foreign taxes. the guidance further requires disclosure of income tax payments to various jurisdictions. this asu is effective for fiscal periods beginning after december 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. this asu should be applied on a prospective basis, although retrospective application is permitted.
management is currently evaluating the impact of the changes required by the new standard on the company's financial statements and related disclosures.
revenue recognition eastman recognizes revenue when performance obligations of the sale are satisfied. eastman sells to customers through master sales agreements or standalone purchase orders. the majority of the company's terms of sale have a single performance obligation to transfer products. accordingly, the company recognizes revenue when control has been transferred to the customer, generally at the time of shipment of products.
eastman accounts for shipping and handling as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the good and does not allocate revenue to those activities. all related shipping and handling costs are recognized at the time of shipment. amounts collected for sales or other similar taxes are presented net of the related tax expense rather than presenting them as additional revenue. the incremental cost of obtaining a sales contract is recognized as a selling expense when incurred given the potential amortization period for such an asset is one year or less. the possible existence of a significant financing component within a sales contract is ignored when the time between cash collection and performance is less than one year. finally, the company does not disclose any unfulfilled obligations as customer purchase order commitments have an original expected duration of one year or less and no consideration from customers is excluded from the transaction price.
66
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements the timing of eastman's customer billings does not always match the timing of revenue recognition. when the company is entitled to bill a customer in advance of the recognition of revenue, a contract liability is recognized. when the company is not entitled to bill a customer until a period after the related recognition of revenue, a contract asset is recognized. contract assets represent the company's right to consideration for the exchange of goods under a contract but which are not yet billable to a customer for consignment inventory or pursuant to certain shipping terms. contract liabilities were $ 29million and $ 18million as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are included as a part of "payables and other current liabilities" and "other long-term liabilities" in the consolidated statements of financial position. contract assets were $ 80million and $ 93million as of december 31,
2023 and 2022, respectively, and are included as a component of "miscellaneous receivables" in the consolidated statements of financial position.
for additional information, see note 20, "segment and regional sales information".
pension and other postretirement benefits eastman maintains defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits. the estimated amounts of the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company's assumptions related to discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increase or decrease for employees, and health care cost trends. the estimated cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover, and plan participation.
eastman's pension and other postretirement benefit plans costs consist of two elements: 1) ongoing costs recognized quarterly, which are comprised of service and interest costs, expected returns on plan assets, and amortization of prior service credits; and 2) mark-to-market ("mtm") gains and losses recognized annually, in the fourth quarter of each year, primarily resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions for discount rates and the differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets. any interim remeasurements triggered by a curtailment, settlement, or significant plan changes are recognized in the quarter in which such remeasurement event occurs.
for additional information, see note 11, "retirement plans".
environmental costs eastman recognizes environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. when a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the company recognizes the minimum undiscounted amount. this undiscounted amount reflects liabilities expected to be paid within approximately 30years and the company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs.
the company also establishes reserves for closure and post-closure costs associated with the environmental and other assets it maintains. environmental assets include but are not limited to waste management units, such as landfills, water treatment facilities, and surface impoundments. when these types of assets are constructed or installed, a loss contingency reserve is established for the anticipated future costs associated with the retirement or closure of the asset based on its expected life and the applicable regulatory closure requirements.
the company recognizes the asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. the asset retirement obligations are discounted to expected present value and subsequently adjusted for changes in fair value. these future estimated costs are charged to earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets. if the company changes its estimate of the environmental asset retirement obligation costs or its estimate of the useful lives of these assets, earnings will be impacted in the period the estimate is changed. the associated estimated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the long-lived assets and depreciated over their useful life and charged to "cost of sales" in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings.
environmental costs are capitalized if they extend the life of the related property, increase its capacity, or mitigate the possibility of future contamination. the cost of operating and maintaining environmental control facilities is charged to "cost of sales" in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings, as incurred.
for additional information see note 13, "environmental matters and asset retirement obligations".

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements share-based compensation eastman recognizes compensation expense in "selling, general and administrative expense" in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings for stock options and other share-based compensation awards based upon the grant-date fair value over the substantive vesting period.
for additional information, see note 18, "share-based compensation plans and awards".
restructuring of operations eastman records restructuring charges for costs incurred in connection with consolidation of operations, exited business or product lines, or shutdowns of specific sites that are expected to be substantially completed within twelve months. these restructuring charges are recorded as incurred, and are associated with site closures, legal and environmental matters, demolition, contract terminations, obsolete inventory, or other costs and charges directly related to the restructuring. the company records severance charges for employee separations when the separation is probable and reasonably estimable. in the event employees are required to perform future service, the company records severance charges ratably over the remaining service period of those employees.
for additional information, see note 16, "asset impairments and restructuring charges, net".
income taxes the provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax bases of eastman's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. the recoverability of the company's deferred tax assets are evaluated each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the company's net deferred tax assets. valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.
provision has been made for income taxes on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and affiliates, except for subsidiaries in which earnings are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. the calculation of income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations, which are subject to legal interpretation and management judgment. eastman's income tax returns are regularly examined by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and those audits may result in proposed adjustments. the company has evaluated these potential issues under the more-likely-than-not standard of the accounting literature. a tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized. such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements, court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations. the company accrues interest related to unrecognized income tax positions, which is included as a component of the income tax provision on the balance sheet. the accrued interest related to unrecognized income tax positions and taxes resulting from the global intangible low-tax income are recorded as a component of the income tax provision.
for additional information, see note 8, "income taxes".
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include cash, time deposits, and readily marketable securities with original maturities of three months or less.

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements fair value measurements eastman records recurring and non-recurring financial assets and liabilities as well as all non-financial assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurement at the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. these fair value principles prioritize valuation inputs across three broad levels. level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on the company's assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. an asset or liability's classification within the various levels is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
accounts receivable and allowance for credit losses trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. eastman maintains allowances for estimated credit losses, which are developed at a market, country, and region level based on risk of collection as well as current and forecasted economic conditions. the company calculates the allowance based on an assessment of the risk when the accounts receivable is recognized. write-offs are recorded at the time a customer receivable is deemed uncollectible. allowance for credit losses was $ 17million and $ 15million as of december 31,
2023 and 2022, respectively. the company does not enter into receivables of a long-term nature, also known as financing receivables, in the normal course of business.
inventories inventories measured by the last-in, first-out ("lifo") method are valued at the lower of cost or market and inventories measured by the first-in, first-out ("fifo") method are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. eastman determines the cost of most raw materials, work in process, and finished goods inventories in the united states and switzerland by the lifo method. the cost of all other inventories is determined by the average cost method, which approximates the fifo method. the company writes-down its inventories equal to the difference between the carrying value of inventory and the estimated market value or net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
for additional information, see note 3, "inventories".
properties eastman records properties at cost. maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings; replacements and betterments are capitalized. when eastman retires or otherwise disposes of assets, it removes the cost of such assets and related accumulated depreciation from the accounts. the company records any profit or loss on retirement or other disposition in "cost of sales" in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings. asset impairments are reflected as increases in accumulated depreciation for properties that have been placed in service. in instances when an asset has not been placed in service and is impaired, the associated costs are removed from the appropriate property accounts.
for additional information, see note 4, "properties and accumulated depreciation".
depreciation and amortization depreciation expense is calculated based on historical cost and the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally using the straight-line method. estimated useful lives for buildings and building equipment generally range from 20
to 50 years. estimated useful lives generally ranging from 3 to 33 yearsare applied to machinery and equipment in the following categories: computer software ( 3 to 5 years); office furniture and fixtures and computer equipment (
5 to 10 years); vehicles, railcars, and general machinery and equipment ( 5 to 20 years); and manufacturing-related improvements ( 20 to 33 years). accelerated depreciation is reported when the estimated useful life is shortened and continues to be reported in "cost of sales" in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings.
for additional information, see note 4, "properties and accumulated depreciation".
amortization expense for definite-lived intangible assets is generally determined using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. amortization expense is reported in "cost of sales" in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings.
for additional information, see note 5, "goodwill and other intangible assets".

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements impairment of long-lived assets definite-lived assets properties and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets to be held and used by eastman are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. the review of properties and equipment and the review of definite-lived intangible assets is performed at the asset group level, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. if the carrying amount is not considered to be recoverable, an analysis of fair value is triggered. an impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value.
goodwill goodwill is an asset determined as the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of identified assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination. eastman conducts testing of goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. the testing of goodwill is performed at the "reporting unit" level which the company has determined to be its "components".
components are defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, and in order to be a reporting unit, the component must 1) be a "business" as defined by applicable accounting standards (an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return in the form of dividends, lower costs, or other economic benefits directly to the investors or other owners, members, or participants); 2) have discrete financial information available; and 3) be reviewed regularly by company operating segment management. the company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities. an impairment is recognized when the reporting unit's estimated fair value is less than its carrying value. the company may use a qualitative analysis or a quantitative analysis in testing the carrying value of goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment. when the quantitative analysis is used, the company uses an income approach, specifically a discounted cash flow model.
indefinite-lived intangible assets eastman conducts testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered to be impaired when the fair value, estimated by appraisal or based on discounted future cash flows of certain related products, is less than the respective carrying value.
indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting primarily of various tradenames, are tested for potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value to the carrying amount. the company may use a qualitative analysis or a quantitative analysis in testing the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. when the quantitative analysis is used, the company uses an income approach, specifically the relief from royalty method, to test indefinite-lived intangible assets. the estimated fair value of tradenames is determined based on an assumed royalty rate savings, discounted by the calculated market participant estimated weighted average cost of capital
("wacc") plus a risk premium.
for additional information, see note 5, "goodwill and other intangible assets".
leases there are two types of leases: financing and operating. both types of leases have associated right-to-use assets and lease liabilities that are valued at the net present value of the lease payments and recognized on the consolidated statements of financial position. the discount rate used in the measurement of a right-to-use asset and lease liability is the rate implicit in the lease whenever that rate is readily determinable. if the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the collateralized incremental borrowing rate is used. the company elected the accounting policy not to apply the recognition and measurement requirements to short-term leases with a term of 12 months or less and do not include a bargain purchase option. residual guarantee payments that become probable and estimable are recognized as rent expense over the remaining life of the applicable lease.
for lease accounting policies, see note 12, "leases and other commitments".

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements investments the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of eastman and all its subsidiaries and entities or joint ventures in which a controlling interest is maintained. the company includes its share of earnings and losses of such investments in "net earnings attributable to eastman" and "comprehensive income attributable to eastman"
located in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings and in "total equity" located in the consolidated statements of financial position.
investments in affiliates over which the company has significant influence but not a controlling interest are carried under the equity method of accounting. these investments are included in "other noncurrent assets" in the consolidated statements of financial position. the company includes its share of earnings and losses of such investments in "other (income) charges, net" located in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings.
for additional information, see note 6, "equity investments".
derivative and non-derivative financial instruments eastman uses derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage its exposure to market risks, such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. the company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes.
the company's derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial position and measured at fair value. hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively for all hedges that no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
for additional information, see note 10, "derivative and non-derivative financial instruments".
litigation and contingent liabilities from time to time, eastman and its operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. the company accrues a contingent loss liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. when a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the company accrues the minimum amount. the company expenses legal costs, including those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred.
for additional information, see note 14, "legal matters".
working capital management and off balance sheet arrangements the company has an off balance sheet, uncommitted accounts receivable factoring program under which entire invoices may be sold to third-party financial institutions. the vast majority of these programs are without recourse. under these agreements, the company sells the invoices at face value, less a transaction fee, which substantially equals the carrying value and fair value with no gain or loss recognized, and no credit loss exposure is retained.
available capacity under these programs, which the company uses as a routine source of working capital funding, is dependent on the level of accounts receivable eligible to be sold and the financial institutions' willingness to purchase such receivables. in addition, certain programs also require that the company continue to service, administer, and collect the sold accounts receivable at market rates. the total amount of receivables sold in 2023
and 2022 were $ 2.8billion and $ 2.5billion, respectively.
the company works with suppliers to optimize payment terms and conditions on accounts payable to enhance timing of working capital and cash flows. under a supplier finance program, the company's suppliers may voluntarily sell receivables due from eastman to a participating financial institution. eastman's responsibility is limited to making payments on the terms originally negotiated with suppliers, regardless of whether the suppliers sell their receivables to the financial institution. the range of payment terms eastman negotiates with suppliers are consistent, regardless of whether a supplier participates in the program. no fees are paid by eastman for the supplier finance program or services fees. eastman or the financial institution may terminate the program at any time with immediate effect upon 90 days' notice. confirmed obligations in the supplier

all foreign earnings, with the exception of short-term liquid assets on certain foreign subsidiaries, including basis differences, continue to be considered indefinitely reinvested. as of december 31, 2023, unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside the u.s. totaled approximately $ 3.5billion of which a substantial portion has already been subject to u.s. tax. the company has not determined the deferred tax liability associated with these unremitted earnings and basis differences, as such determination is not practicable.
at december 31, 2023, foreign net operating loss carryforwards totaled $ 2.5billion. of this amount, $ 900million will expire in 1to 20years and $ 1.6billion of the carryforwards have no expiration date. a valuation allowance of approximately $ 59million has been provided against such net operating loss carryforwards and other foreign deferred income tax balances.
at december 31, 2023, there were nofederal net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income. at december 31, 2023, foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $ 89million were available to reduce possible future u.s. income taxes, which expire from 2024 to 2033. as a result of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act ("tax reform act"), the company may no longer be able to utilize certain u.s. foreign tax credit carryforwards.
a valuation allowance of $ 79million has been established on a portion of deferred tax assets as of december 31,
2023.
a partial valuation allowance of $ 42million has been established for the solutia, inc. ("solutia") state net operating loss carryforwards. the valuation allowance will be retained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, or the related statute expires.
the tax reform act eliminated the option to deduct research and development ("r&d") expenses in the period incurred and requires r&d expenses to be capitalized and amortized beginning in 2022.

eastman files federal income tax returns in the u.s. and income tax returns in various state and foreign jurisdictions. the company is no longer subject to u.s. federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2017. with few exceptions, eastman is no longer subject to foreign, state, and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2015. solutia and related subsidiaries are no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations for years before 2002.
it is reasonably possible that, as a result of the resolution of federal, state, and foreign examinations and appeals, and the expiration of various statutes of limitation, unrecognized tax benefits could decrease within the next twelve months by up to $ 45million.

(1) the carrying value of the euro-denominated 1.50% notes due may 2023 and 1.875% notes due november 2026
fluctuates with changes in the euro to u.s. dollar exchange rate. the carrying value of these euro-denominated borrowings have been designated as non-derivative net investment hedges of a portion of the company's net investments in euro functional-currency denominated subsidiaries to offset foreign currency fluctuations.
(2) net proceeds from the bond issuance will be used to finance or refinance existing and future eligible green investment initiatives which contribute to eastman's environmental sustainability strategy (a green bond).
in 2023, the company issued $ 500million aggregate principal amount of 5.75% notes due march 2033 in a registered public offering (the "2023 notes"). net proceeds from the 2023 notes were allocated to eligible projects to advance eastman's sustainability goals of mitigating climate change, mainstreaming circular economy, and caring for society. proceeds from the sale of the notes, net of original issue discounts, and issuance costs were $
496million. additionally, the company repaid the 1.5% notes due may 2023, of which $ 808million, including the foreign currency impact, was repaid from a combination of available cash and debt proceeds. there were no debt extinguishment costs associated with the repayment of this debt. total consideration for this redemption is reported under financing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
credit facility, term loans, and commercial paper borrowings the company has access to a $ 1.50billion revolving credit agreement (the "credit facility") that was amended in march 2023. the amendment replaced the london interbank offered rate-based ("libor") reference interest rate option with a reference interest rate option based upon term secured overnight financing rate ("sofr") (as defined in the credit facility). all other material terms of the credit facility remain unchanged. borrowings under the credit facility are subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates and a commitment fee is paid on the total unused commitment. the credit facility includes sustainability-linked pricing terms, provides available liquidity for general corporate purposes, and supports commercial paper borrowings. commercial paper borrowings are classified as short-term. at december 31, 2023 and 2022, the company had nooutstanding borrowings under the credit facility. at december 31, 2023, the company had nooutstanding commercial paper borrowings. at december 31, 2022, the company's commercial paper borrowings were $ 326million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.85%.
80
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in 2023, the company borrowed $ 300million under a delayed draw two-year term loan (the "2024 term loan"), which was executed in fourth quarter 2022. as of december 31, 2023 the 2024 term loan balance outstanding was $
300million with a variable interest rate of 6.58%. in 2022, the company borrowed $ 500million under a five-year term loan agreement (the "2027 term loan"). the 2027 term loan balance outstanding was $ 499million at both december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, with a variable interest rate of 6.58% and 5.55%, respectively. borrowings under the 2024 term loan and 2027 term loan are subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates.
the credit facility, the 2024 term loan, and the 2027 term loan contain customary covenants, including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios, that determine the events of default, amounts available, and terms of borrowings. the company was in compliance with all applicable covenants at both december 31, 2023 and 2022.
fair value of borrowings eastman has classified its total borrowings at december 31, 2023 and 2022 under the fair value hierarchy as defined in the accounting policies in note 1, "significant accounting policies". the fair value for fixed-rate debt securities is based on quoted market prices for the same or similar debt instruments and is classified as level 2.
the fair value for the company's other borrowings, under the term loans and commercial paper, equals the carrying value and is classified as level 2. at december 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of total borrowings was $
4.7billion and $ 4.9billion, respectively. the company had noborrowings classified as level 1 or level 3 as of december 31, 2023 and 2022.
subsequent actions in january 2024, the company repaid the 7.25% notes due january 2024 ($ 198million principal) using available cash.
there were no debt extinguishment costs associated with the repayment of this debt.
10. derivative and non-derivative financial instruments overview of hedging programs eastman is exposed to market risks, such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. to mitigate these market risks and their effects on the cash flows of the underlying transactions and investments in foreign subsidiaries, the company uses various derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, when appropriate, in accordance with the company's hedging strategy and policies. designation is performed on a specific exposure basis to support hedge accounting. the company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes.
cash flow hedges cash flow hedges are derivative instruments designated as and used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk. the derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge are reported on the balance sheet at fair value and the changes in fair value of these hedging instruments are offset in part or in whole by corresponding changes in the anticipated cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. the change in the hedge instrument is reported as a component of aoci located in the consolidated statements of financial position and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. cash flows from cash flow hedges are classified as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
foreign currency exchange rate hedging eastman manufactures and sells its products in a number of countries throughout the world and, as a result, is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. to manage the volatility relating to these exposures, the company nets the exposures on a consolidated basis to take advantage of natural offsets. to manage the remaining exposure, the company enters into currency option and forward cash flow hedges to hedge probable anticipated, but not yet committed, export sales and purchase transactions expected within a rolling three year period and denominated in foreign currencies (principally the euro). additionally, the company, from time to time, enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies.
81
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in fourth quarter 2022, the company de-designated and monetized certain forward cash flow hedges. the resulting unrealized gain of $ 27million was recorded in aoci and was primarily recognized in earnings in 2023 as the underlying forecasted transactions impacted earnings.
commodity hedging certain raw material and energy sources used by eastman, as well as sales of certain commodity products by the company, are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply and demand conditions, economic variables and other unpredictable factors. this volatility is primarily related to the market pricing of benzene, ethane, ethylene, natural gas, paraxylene, and propane. in order to mitigate expected fluctuations in market prices, from time to time, the company enters into option and forward contracts and designates these contracts as cash flow hedges. the company currently hedges commodity price risks using derivative financial instrument transactions within a rolling three year period. the company weights its hedge portfolio more heavily in the first year with declining coverage over the remaining periods.
interest rate hedging eastman's policy is to manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. to manage interest rate risk effectively, the company, from time to time, enters into cash flow interest rate derivative instruments, primarily forward starting swaps and treasury locks, to hedge the company's exposure to movements in interest rates prior to anticipated debt offerings. these instruments are designated as cash flow hedges.
in 2022, the company settled the notional amount of $ 75million associated with the 2022 forward starting interest rate swap, resulting in a cash gain of $ 13million which is included as part of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. the recognized gain from cash flow hedges of $ 1million is included within
"net interest expense" on the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings and the unrecognized gain of $ 12million from cash flow hedges is included in aoci on the consolidated statements of financial position.
fair value hedges fair value hedges are defined as derivative or non-derivative instruments designated as and used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk. the derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are reported as "long-term borrowings" on the consolidated statements of financial position at fair value and the changes in fair value of these hedging instruments are offset in part or in whole by corresponding changes in the anticipated fair value of the underlying exposures being hedged. the net of the change in the hedge instrument and item being hedged for qualifying fair value hedges is recognized in earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. cash flows from fair value hedges are classified as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
interest rate hedging eastman's policy is to manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. to manage the company's mix of fixed and variable rate debt effectively, from time to time, the company enters into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. these swaps are designated as hedges of the fair value of the underlying debt obligations and the interest rate differential is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swaps.
net investment hedges net investment hedges are defined as derivative or non-derivative instruments designated as and used to hedge the foreign currency exposure of the net investment in certain foreign operations. the net of the change in the hedge instrument and item being hedged for qualifying net investment hedges is reported as a component of the "cumulative translation adjustment" ("cta") within aoci located in the consolidated statements of financial position. cash flows from the cta component are classified as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
recognition in earnings of amounts previously recognized in cta is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged foreign operation. in the event of a complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment, cash flows from net investment hedges are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
82
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for derivative cross-currency interest rate swap net investment hedges, gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in cta within aoci and recognized in earnings through the periodic swap interest accruals. the cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as net investment hedges are included as part of "other long-term liabilities", "other noncurrent assets", "payables and other current liabilities", or "other current assets" on the consolidated statements of financial position. cash flows from excluded components are classified as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
eastman enters into fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swaps and designates these swaps to hedge a portion of its net investment in a non-u.s. dollar functional currency denominated subsidiary against foreign currency fluctuations.
these contracts involve the exchange of fixed u.s. dollars with fixed foreign currency interest payments periodically over the life of the contracts and an exchange of the notional amounts at maturity.
in first quarter 2023, eastman entered into fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swaps of $ 300million (€ 283million)
maturing march 2033 and $ 50million (¥ 6.7billion) maturing march 2025.
in third quarter 2023, eastman entered into fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swaps of $ 375million (€ 340million)
maturing march 2025 and $ 125million (€ 113million) maturing december 2028. additionally, eastman voluntarily terminated and reentered into fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swaps of $ 375million (€ 340million terminated; €
351million reentered) maturing march 2025, $ 305million (€ 265million terminated; € 285million reentered) maturing december 2028, and $ 50million (¥ 6.7billion terminated; ¥ 7.4billion reentered) maturing march 2025.
the termination of cross-currency swaps in third quarter 2023 resulted in a $ 34million gain recognized in cta. the related cash flows were classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
in 2022, the company terminated fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swaps designated to hedge a portion of its net investment in a euro functional currency denominated subsidiary against foreign currency fluctuations. the notional amount terminated was € 266million ($ 320million) which was scheduled to mature in august 2022. the termination resulted in a $ 40million gain recognized in cta. the related cash flows were classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
in january 2024, in conjunction with the repayment of the 7.25% notes due january 2024, the company terminated fixed-to-fixed cross-currency swaps of $190 million (€165 million) maturing january 2024.

fair value measurements for additional information on fair value measurement, see note 1, "significant accounting policies".
all the company's derivative assets and liabilities are currently classified as level 2. level 2 fair value is based on estimates using standard pricing models. these standard pricing models use inputs that are derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rate yield curves and currency spot and forward rates. the fair value of commodity contracts is derived using forward curves supplied by an industry recognized and unrelated third party. in addition, on an ongoing basis, the company compares a subset of its valuations against valuations received from the counterparties to validate the accuracy of its standard pricing models. the company had noderivatives classified as level 1 or level 3 as of december 31, 2023 or december 31, 2022. counterparties to these derivative contracts are highly rated financial institutions which the company believes carry minimal risk of nonperformance and the company diversifies its positions among such counterparties to reduce its exposure to counterparty risk and credit losses. the company monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties on an ongoing basis. the company did not realize a credit loss during the years ended december 31, 2023 or 2022.
all the company's derivative contracts are subject to master netting arrangements, or similar agreements, which provide for the option to settle contracts on a net basis when they settle on the same day and in the same currency. in addition, these arrangements provide for a net settlement of all contracts with a given counterparty in the event that the arrangement is terminated due to the occurrence of default or a termination event. the company does not have any cash collateral due under such agreements.

retirement plans as described below, eastman offers various postretirement benefits to its employees.
defined contribution plans eastman sponsors a defined contribution employee stock ownership plan (the "esop"), which is a component of the eastman investment plan and employee stock ownership plan ("eip/esop"), under section 401(a) of the internal revenue code. eastman made a contribution in february 2024 to the eip/esop for substantially all u.s. employees equal to 5percent of their eligible compensation for the 2023 plan year. employees may allocate contributions to other investment funds within the eip from the esop at any time without restrictions. allocated shares in the esop totale d 1,899,512; 1,871,624 ; and 1,909,362shares as of december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.
dividends on shares held by the eip/esop are charged to retained earnings. all shares held by the eip/esop are treated as outstanding in computing earnings per share ("eps").
in 2006, the company amended its eip/esop to provide a company match of 50percent of the first 7percent of an employee's compensation contributed to the plan for employees who are hired on or after january 1, 2007. employees who are hired on or after january 1, 2007, are also eligible for the contribution to the esop as described above.
charges for domestic contributions to the eip/esop were $ 79million, $ 81million, and $ 73million for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.
defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans pension plans eastman maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits.
effective january 1, 2000, the company's eastman retirement assistance plan, a u.s. defined benefit pension plan, was amended. employees' accrued pension benefits earned prior to january 1, 2000 are calculated based on previous plan provisions using the employee's age, years of service, and final average compensation as defined in the plans.
the amended plan uses a pension equity formula to calculate an employee's retirement benefits from january 1, 2000
forward. benefits payable will be the combined pre-2000 and post-1999 benefits. employees hired on or after january
1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in eastman's u.s. defined benefit pension plans.
benefits are paid to employees from trust funds. contributions to the trust funds are made as permitted by laws and regulations. the pension trust funds do not directly own any of the company's common stock.
pension coverage for employees of eastman's non-u.s. operations is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. the company systematically provides for obligations under such plans by depositing funds with trustees, under insurance policies, or by book reserves.
other postretirement benefit plans under its other postretirement benefit plans in the u.s., eastman provides life insurance for eligible retirees hired prior to january 1, 2007. company funding is also provided for eligible medicare retirees hired prior to january 1, 2007 with a health reimbursement arrangement. a few of the company's non-u.s. operations have supplemental health benefit plans for certain retirees, the cost of which is not significant to the company.

(1) includes a curtailment in 2022 triggered by the sale of the adhesives resins business which is included in
"other components of post-employment (benefit) cost, net" on the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings.
in 2022, subsequent to the adhesives resins divestiture, the company retained pension liabilities of certain plan participants. as such, the status of those participants changed in a non-u.s. pension plan which triggered a curtailment and an interim mtm remeasurement of the impacted non-u.s. pension plan's assets and liabilities. a curtailment gain of $ 7million, including $ 3million reduction in the pension benefit obligation and $ 4million of prior service credits recognized immediately, and a mtm gain of $ 3million were recognized in 2022.
settlements are triggered in a plan when distributions exceed the sum of service cost and interest cost of the respective plan. lump sum payments from a u.s. pension plan resulted in a plan settlement in second quarter 2022.
the settlement was not material. however, the settlement triggered an interim remeasurement of the impacted u.s.
pension plan's assets and liabilities and, as such, the company recognized a mtm loss of $ 7million in 2022.

the company calculates service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for its significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected cash flows.
the fair value of plan assets for the u.s. pension plans at december 31, 2023 and 2022 was $ 1.3billion and $
1.4billion, respectively, while the fair value of plan assets at december 31, 2023 and 2022 for non-u.s. pension plans was $ 639million and $ 589million, respectively. at december 31, 2023 and 2022, the expected weighted-average long-term rate of return on u.s. pension plan assets was 7.50percent and 6.62percent, respectively. the expected weighted-average long-term rate of return on non-u.s. pension plans assets was 4.74percent and 3.86percent at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

(1) cash and cash equivalents: funds generally invested in actively managed collective trust funds or interest bearing accounts.
(2) public equity - united states: common stock equity securities which are primarily valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices.
(3) other investments: primarily consist of insurance contracts which are generally valued using a crediting rate that approximates market returns and investments in underlying securities whose market values are unobservable and determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques.
(4) investments measured at net asset value: the underlying debt, public equity, and public real asset investments in this category are generally held in common trust funds, which are either actively or passively managed investment vehicles, that are valued at the net asset value per unit/share multiplied by the number of units/shares held as of the measurement date. the other alternative investments in this category are valued under the practical expedient method which is based on the most recently reported net asset value provided by the management of each private investment fund, adjusted as appropriate, for any lag between the date of the financial reports and the measurement date.

investment strategy eastman's investment strategy for its defined benefit pension plans is to maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets within an acceptable level of risk in order to meet or exceed the plan's actuarially assumed long-term rate of return and to minimize the cost of providing pension benefits. a periodic asset/liability study is conducted in order to assist in the determination and, if necessary, modification of the appropriate long-term investment policy for the plan. the investment policy establishes a target allocation range for each asset class and the fund is managed within those ranges. the plans use a number of investment approaches including investments in equity, real estate, and fixed income funds in which the underlying securities are marketable in order to achieve this target allocation. the plans also invest in private equity and other funds. diversification is created through investments across various asset classes, geographies, fund managers, and individual securities. this investment process is designed to provide for a well-diversified portfolio with no significant concentration of risk. the investment process is monitored by an investment committee that includes senior management.
eastman's investment strategy for its veba trust is to invest in intermediate-term, well diversified, high quality investment instruments, with a primary objective of capital preservation.
the expected rate of return for all plans was determined primarily by modeling the expected long-term rates of return for the categories of investments held by the plans and the targeted allocation percentage against various potential economic scenarios.
the company made nocontributions to its u.s. defined benefit pension plans in 2023 or 2022. for 2024 calendar year, there are no minimum required cash contributions for the u.s. defined benefit pension plans under the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended, and the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended.
benefit payments are made using a combination of plan assets and cash payments. most of the company's pension plans have plan assets that predominately cover pension benefit obligations. the estimated future benefit payments, reflecting expected future service, as appropriate, are as follows:

leases and other commitments leases there are two types of leases: financing and operating. both types of leases have associated right-to-use assets and lease liabilities that are valued at the net present value of the lease payments and recognized on the consolidated statements of financial position. the discount rate used in the measurement of a right-to-use asset and lease liability is the rate implicit in the lease whenever that rate is readily determinable. if the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the collateralized incremental borrowing rate is used. the company elected the accounting policy not to apply the recognition and measurement requirements to short-term leases with a term of 12 months or less and do not include a bargain purchase option.
the company has operating leases, as a lessee, with customary terms that do not include: significant variable lease payments; significant reasonably certain extensions or options required to be included in the lease term;
restrictions; or other covenants for real property, rolling stock, and machinery and equipment. real property leases primarily consist of office space and rolling stock leases primarily for railcars and fleet vehicles. at december 31, 2023 and 2022, right-to-use assets for operating leases of $ 180 millionand $ 211 million, respectively, are included as a part of "other noncurrent assets" on the consolidated statements of financial position. at both december 31, 2023 and 2022, the operating right-to-use assets include $ 3million of assets previously classified as lease intangibles and $ 5million and $ 6million of prepaid lease assets, respectively.
operating lease liabilities are included as a part of "payables and other current liabilities" and "other long-term liabilities" on the consolidated statements of financial position. as of december 31, 2023, financing leases were not material to the company's financial statements.
as of december 31, 2023, reconciliation of lease payments and operating lease liabilities is provided below:

the company has operating leases, primarily leases for railcars, with terms that require the company to guarantee a portion of the residual value of the leased assets upon termination of the lease that will expire beginning second quarter 2024. residual guarantee payments that become probable and estimable are recognized as rent expense over the remaining life of the applicable lease. management's current expectation is that the likelihood of material residual guarantee payments is remote.

estimated future payments of debt securities assumes the repayment of principal upon stated maturity, and actual amounts and the timing of such payments may differ materially due to repayment or other changes in the terms of such debt prior to maturity.
eastman had various purchase obligations at december 31, 2023 totaling approximately $ 3.0billion over a period of approximately 30years for materials, supplies, and energy incident to the ordinary conduct of business.
amounts in other liabilities represent the current estimated cash payments required to be made by the company primarily for pension and other postretirement benefits, accrued compensation benefits, environmental loss contingency estimates, uncertain tax liabilities, and commodity and foreign exchange hedging in the periods indicated. due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with respect to taxing authorities, management is unable to determine the timing of payments related to uncertain tax liabilities and these amounts are included in the "2029 and beyond" line item.
96
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements the amount and timing of pension and other postretirement benefit payments included in other liabilities is dependent upon interest rates, health care cost trends, actual returns on plan assets, retirement and attrition rates of employees, continuation or modification of the benefit plans, and other factors. such factors can significantly impact the amount and timing of any future contributions by the company. excess contributions are periodically made by management in order to keep the plans' funded status above 80 percent under the funding provisions of the pension protection act to avoid partial benefit restrictions on accelerated forms of payment. the company's u.s. defined benefit pension plans are not currently under any benefit restrictions. see note 11,
"retirement plans", for more information regarding pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.
the resolution of uncertainties related to environmental matters included in other liabilities may have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated results of operations in the period recognized, however, because of the availability of legal defenses, the company's preliminary assessment of actions that may be required, and, if applicable, the expected sharing of costs, management does not believe that the company's liability for these environmental matters, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. see "environmental costs" in note 1, "significant accounting policies", and see note 13, "environmental matters and asset retirement obligations", for more information regarding outstanding environmental matters and asset retirement obligations.
guarantees and claims also arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers, suppliers, joint venture partners, and other parties when the company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others if specified triggering events occur. non-performance under a contract could trigger an obligation of the company. the company's current other guarantees include guarantees relating to intellectual property, third-party debt, and other indemnifications and have arisen through the normal course of business. the ultimate effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists as to the final outcome of these claims, if they were to occur. these other guarantees have remaining terms up to 15 yearswith maximum potential future payments of approximately $ 170million in the aggregate, with none of these guarantees being individually significant to the company's operating results, financial position, or liquidity. management's current expectation is that future payment or performance related to non-performance under other guarantees is remote. eastman has letters of credit and surety bonds of approximately $
80million as of december 31, 2023 to support commitments made in the ordinary course of business. the company does not expect that any claims against or draws on these instruments would have a material adverse effect on the company.
13. environmental matters and asset retirement obligations certain eastman manufacturing facilities generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes, of which the treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal are regulated by various governmental agencies. in connection with the cleanup of various hazardous waste sites, the company, along with many other entities, has been designated a potentially responsible party ("prp") by the u.s. environmental protection agency under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act, which potentially subjects prps to joint and several liability for certain cleanup costs. in addition, the company will incur costs for environmental remediation and closure and post-closure under the federal resource conservation and recovery act. reserves for environmental contingencies have been established in accordance with eastman's policies described in note 1, "significant accounting policies". the resolution of uncertainties related to environmental matters may have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in the period recognized.
however, because of the availability of legal defenses, the company's preliminary assessment of actions that may be required, and the extended period of time that the obligations are expected to be satisfied, management does not believe that the company's liability for these environmental matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the company's future overall financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
environmental remediation and environmental asset retirement obligations the company's net environmental reserve for environmental contingencies, including remediation costs and asset retirement obligations, is included as part of "other noncurrent assets", "payables and other current liabilities", and "other long-term liabilities" on the consolidated statements of financial position as follows:

notes to the audited consolidated financial statements environmental remediation estimated future environmental expenditures for undiscounted remediation costs ranged from the best estimate or minimum of $ 252million to the maximum of $ 497million and from the best estimate or minimum of $ 245million to the maximum of $ 457million at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the best estimate or minimum estimated future environmental expenditures are considered to be probable and reasonably estimable.
costs of certain remediation projects included in the environmental reserve are subject to a cost-sharing arrangement with monsanto company ("monsanto") under the provisions of the amended and restated settlement agreement effective february 28, 2008 (the "effective date"), into which solutia entered with monsanto upon its emergence from bankruptcy (the "monsanto settlement agreement"). under the provisions of the monsanto settlement agreement, solutia, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of eastman on july 2, 2012, shares responsibility with monsanto for remediation at certain locations outside of the boundaries of plant sites in anniston, alabama and sauget, illinois (the "shared sites"). solutia is responsible for the funding of environmental liabilities at the shared sites up to a total of $ 325million from the effective date. if remediation costs for the shared sites exceed this amount, such costs will thereafter be shared equally between solutia and monsanto. including payments by solutia prior to its acquisition by eastman, $ 123million had been paid for costs at the shared sites as of december 31, 2023. as of december 31, 2023, an additional $ 208million has been recognized for estimated future remediation costs at the shared sites, over a period of approximately 30 years.
reserves for environmental remediation include liabilities expected to be paid within approximately 30years.
eastman has letters of credit of approximately $ 160million to support certain environmental matters. the company does not expect that any claims against or draws on these instruments would have a material adverse effect on the company. the amounts charged to pre-tax earnings for environmental remediation and related charges are recognized in "cost of sales" and "other (income) charges, net" on the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings.
changes in the reserves for environmental remediation liabilities during 2023 and 2022 are summarized below:

environmental asset retirement obligations an asset retirement obligation is an obligation for the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that is incurred upon the acquisition, construction, development, or normal operation of that long-lived asset. environmental asset retirement obligations consist primarily of closure and post-closure costs. for sites that have environmental asset retirement obligations, the best estimate recognized to date for these environmental asset retirement obligation costs was $ 32million and $ 29million at december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, respectively.
other eastman's cash expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement were $ 314million, $ 300million, and $ 281million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, and include operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and facilities, engineering costs, and construction costs. the cash expenditures above include environmental capital expenditures of approximately $ 65million, $ 60million, and $ 38million in 2023, 2022, and
2021, respectively.
98
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements the company has contractual asset retirement obligations not associated with environmental liabilities. eastman's non-environmental asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with the future closure of leased manufacturing assets in pace, florida and oulu, finland. these non-environmental asset retirement obligations were
$ 51million at both december 31, 2023 and 2022, and are included in "other long-term liabilities" on the consolidated statements of financial position.
14.
legal matters from time to time, eastman and its operations are parties to, or targets of, lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. while the company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters, it does not believe, based upon currently available facts, that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters will have a material adverse effect on its overall financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

eastman is authorized to issue 400million shares of all classes of stock, of which 50million may be preferred stock, par value $ 0.01per share, and 350million may be common stock, par value $ 0.01per share. the company declared dividends per share of $ 3.18in 2023, $ 3.07in 2022, and $ 2.83in 2021.
in 1997 the company established a benefit security trust to provide a degree of financial security for unfunded obligations under certain unfunded plans. a warrant to purchase up to 6million shares of par value common stock of the company was contributed to the trust. the warrant, which remains outstanding, is exercisable by the trustee if the company does not meet certain funding obligations, which obligations would be triggered by certain occurrences, including a change in control or potential change in control, as defined, or failure by the company to meet its payment obligations under certain covered unfunded plans. the warrant is excluded from the computation of diluted eps because the conditions upon which the warrant becomes exercisable have not been met.

share-based compensation plans and awards
2021 omnibus stock compensation plan eastman's 2021 omnibus stock compensation plan ("2021 omnibus plan") was approved by stockholders at the may 6,
2021 annual meeting of stockholders and shall remain in effect until its fifth anniversary.the 2021 omnibus plan authorizes the compensation and management development committee of the board of directors to grant awards, designate participants, determine the types and numbers of awards, determine the terms and conditions of awards and determine the form of award settlement. under the 2021 omnibus plan, the aggregate number of shares reserved and available for issuance is 10million, which consist of shares not previously authorized for issuance under any other plan. the number of shares covered by an award is counted against this share reserve as of the grant date of the award. shares covered by full value awards (e.g., performance shares and restricted stock awards) are counted against the total number of shares available for issuance or delivery under the plan as 2.5shares for every one share covered by the award. any stock distributed pursuant to an award may consist of, in whole or in part, authorized and unissued stock, treasury stock, or stock purchased on the open market. under the 2021 omnibus plan and previous plans, the forms of awards have included restricted stock and restricted stock units, stock options, stock appreciation rights ("sars"), and performance shares. the 2021 omnibus plan is flexible as to the number of specific forms of awards, but provides that stock options and sars are to be granted at an exercise price not less than 100 percent of the per share fair market value on the date of the grant.
director stock compensation subplan eastman's amended 2021 director stock compensation subplan ("directors' subplan"), a component of the 2021 omnibus plan, remains in effect until terminated by the board of directors or the earlier termination of the 2021 omnibus plan. the directors' subplan provides for structured awards of restricted shares to non-employee members of the board of directors. restricted shares awarded under the directors' subplan are subject to the same terms and conditions of the 2021 omnibus plan. the directors' subplan does not constitute a separate source of shares for grants of equity awards and all shares awarded are part of the 10 million shares authorized under the 2021 omnibus plan. shares of restricted stock are granted on the first day of a non-employee director's initial term of service and shares of restricted stock are granted each year to each non-employee director on the date of the annual meeting of stockholders.
it has been the company's practice to issue new shares rather than treasury shares for equity awards for compensation plans, including the 2021 omnibus plan and the directors' subplan, that require settlement by the issuance of common stock and to withhold or accept back shares awarded to cover the related income tax obligations of employee participants. shares of unrestricted common stock owned by non-employee directors are not eligible to be withheld or acquired to satisfy the withholding obligation related to their income taxes. shares of unrestricted common stock owned by specified senior management level employees are accepted by the company to pay the exercise price of stock options in accordance with the terms and conditions of their awards.
compensation expense for 2023, 2022, and 2021, total share-based compensation expense (before tax) of approximately $ 64million, $
69million, and $ 70million, respectively, was recognized in "selling, general and administrative expense" in the consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and retained earnings for all share-based awards of which approximately $ 10million, $ 11million, and $ 9million, respectively, related to stock options. the compensation expense is recognized over the substantive vesting period, which may be a shorter time period than the stated vesting period for qualifying termination eligible employees as defined in the forms of award notice. approximately
$ 6million for 2023, $ 7million for 2022, and $ 2million for 2021 of stock option compensation expense was recognized each year due to qualifying termination eligibility preceding the requisite vesting period.
stock option awards options have been granted on an annual basis by the compensation and management development committee of the board of directors under the 2021 omnibus plan and predecessor plans to employees. option awards have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the company's stock on the date of grant. the term of options is 10 yearswith vesting periods that vary up to three years. vesting usually occurs ratably over the vesting period or at the end of the vesting period. the company utilizes the black scholes merton option valuation model which relies on certain assumptions to estimate an option's fair value.
105
notes to the audited consolidated financial statements the weighted average assumptions used in the determination of fair value for stock options awarded in 2023, 2022, and 2021 are provided in the table below:
assumptions                          2023      2022      2021
expected volatility rate           30.55%    28.98%    28.99%
expected dividend yield             3.31%     2.57%     3.58%
average risk-free interest rate     4.13%     2.35%     0.95%
expected term years                   6.4       6.4       6.0
the volatility rate of grants is derived from historical company common stock price volatility over the same time period as the expected term of each stock option award. the volatility rate is derived by a mathematical formula utilizing the weekly high closing stock price data over the expected term. the expected dividend yield is calculated using the company's average of the last four quarterly dividend yields. the average risk-free interest rate is derived from the united states department of treasury's published interest rates of daily yield curves for the same time period as the expected term. the weighted average expected term reflects the analysis of historical share-based award transactions and includes option swap and reload grants which may have much shorter remaining expected terms than new option grants.
a summary of the activity of the company's stock option awards for 2023, 2022, and 2021 is presented below:

for nonvested options at december 31, 2023, approximately $ 2million in compensation expense will be recognized over the next two years.
other share-based compensation awards in addition to stock option awards, eastman has awarded long-term performance share awards, restricted stock awards, and sars. the long-term performance share awards are based upon actual return on capital compared to a target return on capital and total stockholder return compared to a peer group ranking by total stockholder return over a three year performance period. the awards are valued using a monte carlo simulation based model and vest pro-rata over the three year performance period. the number of long-term performance award target shares granted for the 2023-2025, 2022-2024, and 2021-2023 periods were 406thousand, 288thousand, and 311thousand, respectively.
the target shares granted are assumed to be 100 percent. at the end of the three-year performance period, the actual number of shares awarded can range from zero percent to 250 percent of the target shares granted based on the award notice. the number of restricted stock awards granted during 2023, 2022, and 2021 were 144thousand,
160thousand, and 166thousand, respectively. the fair value of a restricted stock award is equal to the closing stock price of the company's stock on the date of grant and normally vests over a period of three years. the recognized compensation expense before tax for these other share-based awards in the years ended december 31, 2023,
2022, and 2021 was approximately $ 55million, $ 58million, and $ 60million, respectively. the unrecognized compensation expense before tax for these same type awards at december 31, 2023 was approximately $ 65million and will be recognized primarily over a period of two years.

disclosure controls and procedures eastman maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission ("sec")
rules and forms. disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the company's management, including the chief executive officer ("ceo") and chief financial officer ("cfo"), of the effectiveness of the company's disclosure controls and procedures. based on that evaluation, the ceo and cfo have concluded that as of december 31, 2023, the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the sec's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the ceo and cfo, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
management necessarily applies its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management's control objectives.
management, including the ceo and cfo, does not expect that the company's disclosure controls and procedures can prevent all possible errors or fraud. a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance; judgments in decision-making can be faulty; and breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. additionally, controls can be circumvented by the acts of one or more persons. the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and while the company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to be effective under circumstances where they should reasonably be expected to operate effectively, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. because of the inherent limitations in any control system, misstatements due to possible errors or fraud may occur and not be detected.
management's report on internal control over financial reporting management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. the company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the company's ceo and cfo to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the company's financial statements for external purposes in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
the company's internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that:
• pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and acquisitions and dispositions of assets of the company;
• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the company;
and
• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the company's financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

based on the framework established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. based on this assessment, management has determined that the company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31, 2023.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dividends and stock repurchases in december 2021, the company's board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of the company's outstanding common stock at such times, in such amounts, and on such terms, as determined by management to be in the best interest of the company and its stockholders (the "2021 authorization"). as of december 31, 2023, a total of 8,610,749 shares have been repurchased under the 2021 authorization for $785 million.
during 2023, the company repurchased 1,866,866 shares of common stock for $150 million. during 2022, the company repurchased 10,710,259 shares of common stock for $1.1 billion, primarily under the 2022 accelerated share repurchase program, and included $100 million from the settlement of a 2021 accelerated share repurchase program.
the board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.81 per share during the first quarter of 2024, payable on april 5, 2024 to stockholders of record on march 15, 2024. both dividends and share repurchases are key strategies employed by the company to return value to its stockholders.
inflation in recent years, eastman has experienced significant volatility attributed to inflation. the cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices, although derivative instruments are utilized, as appropriate, to mitigate short-term market price fluctuations. management expects the volatility of raw material and energy prices and costs to continue and the company will continue to pursue pricing and hedging strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects. for additional information, see "risk factors" in part i, item 1a, "summary by operating segments" in this md&a, and note 10, "derivative and non-derivative financial instruments", to the company's consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report.
recently issued accounting standards for information regarding the impact of recently issued accounting standards, see note 1, "significant accounting policies", to the company's consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report.

risk factors").
we have established procedures based on legal and regulatory requirements on a worldwide basis that are designed to facilitate compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and to require that our policies relating to business conduct, ethics and practices are followed globally. in addition, we have established procedures to mitigate the risk that a counterparty's performance obligations will be unenforceable, including consideration of counterparty legal authority and capacity, adequacy of legal documentation, the permissibility of a transaction under applicable law and whether applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws limit or alter contractual remedies. the heightened legal and regulatory focus on the financial services and banking industries globally presents a continuing business challenge for us.
climate risk climate change manifests as physical and transition risks. the physical risks of climate change include harm to people and property arising from acute climate-related events, such as floods, hurricanes, heatwaves, droughts and wildfires, and chronic, longer-term shifts in climate patterns, such as higher global average temperatures, rising sea levels and long-term droughts. the transition risk of climate change include policy, legal, technology and market changes. examples of these transition risks include changes in consumer behavior and business sentiment, related technologies, shareholder preferences and any additional regulatory and legislative requirements, including increased disclosure or carbon taxes.
climate risk, which is not expected to have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition in the near term, is an overarching risk that can impact other categories of risk. physical risk may lead to increased credit risk by diminishing borrowers' repayment capacity or impacting the value of collateral. in addition, physical risk could pose increased operational risk to our facilities and people. the impacts of transition risk may lead to and amplify credit, market or liquidity risk by reducing our customers' operating income or the value of their assets as well as exposing us to reputational, compliance and/or litigation risk due to increased legal and regulatory scrutiny or negative public sentiment.
as climate risk is interconnected with other risk types, we have developed and continue to enhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our risk management december 2023 form 10-k risk disclosures practices and governance structures. the brc oversees firmwide risks, which include climate risk, and, as part of its oversight, receives updates on our risk management approach to climate risk, including our approaches toward scenario analysis and integration of climate risk into our existing risk management processes. our climate risk management efforts are overseen by the climate risk committee, which is co-chaired by our chief risk officer and chief sustainability officer and shapes our approach to managing climate-related risks in line with our overall risk framework.
december 2023 form 10-k financial statements and supplementary data report of independent registered public accounting firm to the shareholders and the board of directors of morgan stanley:
opinion on the financial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of morgan stanley and subsidiaries (the "firm") as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated income statements, comprehensive income statements, cash flow statements and statements of changes in total equity for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). in our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the firm as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.
we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the firm's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2023, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission and our report dated february 22, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the firm's internal control over financial reporting.
basis for opinion these financial statements are the responsibility of the firm's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the firm's financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the firm in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
critical audit matter the critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
valuation of level 3 financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis and level 3 loans held for sale - refer to note 4 to the financial statements critical audit matter description the firm's trading and financing activities result in the firm carrying material financial instruments having limited price transparency. these financial instruments can span a broad array of product types and generally include derivatives, securities, loans, and borrowings. as described in note 4, these level 3 financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis approximate $9.3 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively, and the level 3 loans held for sale approximate $6.7 billion at december 31, 2023. unlike financial instruments whose inputs are readily observable and, therefore, more easily independently corroborated, the valuation of these financial instruments is inherently subjective and often involves the use of unobservable inputs and proprietary valuation models whose underlying algorithms and valuation methodologies are complex.
we identified the valuation of level 3 financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis and level 3 loans held for sale as a critical audit matter given the firm uses complex valuation models and/or valuation inputs that are not observable in the marketplace to determine the respective carrying values. performing our audit procedures to evaluate the appropriateness of these models and inputs involved a high degree of auditor judgment, professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, and an increased extent of testing.
how the critical audit matter was addressed in the audit our audit procedures related to the valuation of level 3 financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis and level 3 loans held for sale included the following, among others:
•we tested the design and operating effectiveness of the firm's model review and price verification controls. the firm maintains these internal controls to assess the appropriateness december 2023 form 10-k of its valuation methodologies and the relevant inputs and assumptions.
•we independently evaluated the appropriateness of management's valuation methodologies, for selected financial instruments, including the input assumptions, considering the expected assumptions of other market participants and external data when available.
•we developed independent estimates for selected financial instruments, using externally sourced inputs and independent valuation models, and used such estimates to further evaluate management's estimates. for certain of our selected financial instruments, this included a comparison to the firm's estimates for similar transactions and an evaluation of the firm's assumptions inclusive of the inputs, as applicable.
•we tested the revenues arising from the trade date fair value estimates for selected structured transactions for which we developed independent fair value estimates to test the valuation inputs and assumptions used by the firm and evaluated whether these methods were consistent with the firm's relevant valuation policies.
•we assessed the consistency by which management has applied significant and unobservable valuation assumptions used in developing the firm's estimates.
•we performed a retrospective assessment of management's fair value estimates for certain of our selected financial instruments, for which there were events or transactions occurring after the valuation date. we did so by comparing management's estimates to the relevant evidence provided by such events or transactions, as applicable.

1. introduction and basis of presentation the firm morgan stanley is a global financial services firm that maintains significant market positions in each of its business segments-institutional securities, wealth management and investment management. morgan stanley, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, provides a wide variety of products and services to a large and diversified group of clients and customers, including corporations, governments, financial institutions and individuals. unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "morgan stanley" or the "firm" mean morgan stanley (the "parent company") together with its consolidated subsidiaries. see the "glossary of common terms and acronyms" for the definition of certain terms and acronyms used throughout this form 10-k.
a description of the clients and principal products and services of each of the firm's business segments is as follows:
institutional securities provides a variety of products and services to corporations, governments, financial institutions and ultra-high net worth clients. investment banking services consist of capital raising and financial advisory services, including the underwriting of debt, equity securities and other products, as well as advice on mergers and acquisitions, restructurings and project finance. our equity and fixed income businesses include sales, financing, prime brokerage, market-making, asia wealth management services and certain business-related investments. lending activities include originating corporate loans and commercial real estate loans, providing secured lending facilities, and extending securities-based and other financing to customers. other activities include research.
wealth management provides a comprehensive array of financial services and solutions to individual investors and small to medium-sized businesses and institutions covering: financial advisor-led brokerage, custody, administrative and investment advisory services; self-directed brokerage services; financial and wealth planning services; workplace services, including stock plan administration; securities-based lending, residential real estate loans and other lending products; banking; and retirement plan services.
investment management provides a broad range of investment strategies and products that span geographies, asset classes, and public and private markets to a diverse group of clients across institutional and intermediary channels. strategies and products, which are offered through a variety of investment vehicles, include equity, fixed income, alternatives and solutions, and liquidity and overlay services. institutional clients include defined benefit/defined contribution plans, foundations, endowments, government entities, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, third-party fund sponsors and corporations. individual clients are generally served through intermediaries, including affiliated and non-affiliated distributors.
basis of financial information the financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap, which requires the firm to make estimates and assumptions regarding the valuations of certain financial instruments, the valuations of goodwill and intangible assets, the outcome of legal and tax matters, deferred tax assets, acl, and other matters that affect its financial statements and related disclosures. the firm believes that the estimates utilized in the preparation of its financial statements are prudent and reasonable. actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
the notes are an integral part of the firm's financial statements. the firm has evaluated subsequent events for adjustment to or disclosure in these financial statements through the date of this report and has not identified any recordable or disclosable events not otherwise reported in these financial statements or the notes thereto.
consolidation the financial statements include the accounts of the firm, its wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities in which the firm has a controlling financial interest, including certain vies (see note 15). intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. for consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly owned, the third-party holdings of equity interests are referred to as noncontrolling interests. the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as net income applicable to noncontrolling interests in the income statement. the portion of shareholders' equity that is attributable to noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as noncontrolling interests, a component of total equity, in the balance sheet.
for entities where the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support and the equity holders bear the residual economic risks and returns of the entity and have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly affect its economic performance, the firm consolidates those entities it controls either through a majority voting interest or otherwise. for vies (i.e., entities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria), the firm consolidates those entities where it has the power to make the decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the vie and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie.
for investments in entities in which the firm does not have a controlling financial interest but has significant influence over operating and financial decisions, it applies the equity method of accounting with net gains and losses recorded within other december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements revenues (see note 11) unless the firm has elected to measure the investment at fair value, in which case net gains and losses are recorded within investments revenues (see note 5).
equity and partnership interests held by entities qualifying for accounting purposes as investment companies are carried at fair value.

2. significant accounting policies revenue recognition revenues are recognized when the promised goods or services are delivered to our customers in an amount that is based on the consideration the firm expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services when such amounts are not probable of significant reversal.
investment banking revenues from investment banking activities consist of revenues earned from underwriting, primarily equity and fixed income securities and loan syndications, and advisory fees, primarily for mergers, acquisitions and restructurings.
underwriting revenues are generally recognized on trade date if there is no uncertainty or contingency related to the amount to be paid. underwriting costs are deferred and recognized in the relevant non-interest expenses line items when the related underwriting revenues are recorded.
advisory fees are recognized as advice is provided to the client, based on the estimated progress of work and when revenues are not probable of a significant reversal. advisory costs are recognized as incurred in the relevant non-interest expenses line items, including those reimbursed.
commissions and fees commission and fee revenues generally result from transaction-based arrangements in which the client is charged a fee for the execution of transactions. such revenues primarily arise from transactions in equity securities; services related to sales and trading activities; and sales of mutual funds, alternative funds, futures, insurance products and options, as well as revenues from order flow payments for directing customer orders to broker-dealers, exchanges and market centers for execution. commission and fee revenues are recognized on trade date when the performance obligation is satisfied.
asset management revenues asset management, distribution and administration fees are generally based on related asset levels, such as the aum of a customer's account or the net asset value of a fund. these fees are generally recognized when services are performed and the value of the assets is known. management fees are reduced by estimated fee waivers and expense caps, if any, provided to the customer.
performance-based fees not in the form of carried interest are recorded when the annual performance target is met and the revenues are not probable of a significant reversal.
sales commissions paid by the firm in connection with the sale of certain classes of shares of its open-end mutual fund products are accounted for as deferred commission assets and amortized to other expenses over the expected life of the contract. the firm periodically tests deferred commission assets for recoverability based on cash flows expected to be received in future periods. other asset management and distribution costs are recognized as incurred in the relevant non-interest expenses line items.
investments revenues-carried interest the firm is entitled to receive performance-based fees in the form of carried interest when the return in certain funds exceeds specified performance targets. when the firm earns carried interest from funds as specified performance thresholds are met, that carried interest and any related general or limited partner interest are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and measured based on the firm's claim on the nav of the fund at the reporting date, taking into account the distribution terms applicable to the interest held. such items are reflected within investments revenues.
see note 22 for information regarding the net cumulative unrealized amount of performance-based fee revenues at risk of reversal. see note 14 for information regarding general partner guarantees, which include potential obligations to return performance fee distributions previously received.
other items revenues from certain commodities-related contracts are recognized in trading revenues when the firm has transferred control over the promised goods or services to the customer.
receivables from contracts with customers are recognized in customer and other receivables in the balance sheet when the december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements underlying performance obligations have been satisfied and the firm has the right per the contract to bill the customer. contract assets are recognized in other assets when the firm has satisfied its performance obligations but customer payment is conditional on something other than the passage of time. contract liabilities are recognized in other liabilities and accrued expenses when the firm has collected payment from a customer based on the terms of the contract but the underlying performance obligations are not yet satisfied.
for contracts with a term of less than one year, incremental costs to obtain the contract are expensed as incurred. revenues are not discounted when payment is expected within one year.
the firm generally presents, net within revenues, taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected by the firm from a customer.
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with banks. cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of three months or less from the acquisition date that are readily convertible to cash and are not held for trading purposes.
cash and cash equivalents also include restricted cash, such as cash segregated in compliance with federal or other regulations, including minimum reserve requirements set by the federal reserve bank and other central banks, and the firm's initial margin deposited with clearing organizations.
fair value of financial instruments instruments within trading assets and trading liabilities are measured at fair value, either as required or allowed by accounting guidance. these financial instruments primarily represent the firm's trading and investment positions and include both cash and derivative products. in addition, securities classified as available-for-sale ("afs") are measured at fair value.
gains and losses on instruments carried at fair value are reflected in trading revenues, investments revenues or investment banking revenues in the income statement, except for gains and losses related to afs securities (see "afs investment securities" section herein and note 7) and derivatives accounted for as hedges, as well as economic derivative hedges associated with certain held-for-sale and held-for-investment corporate loans and lending commitments (see "hedge accounting" and "other hedges" herein and note 6).
interest income and interest expense are recorded within the income statement depending on the nature of the instrument and related market conventions. when interest is included as a component of the instruments' fair value, interest is recorded within trading revenues or investments revenues. otherwise, it is recorded within interest income or interest expense. dividend income is recorded in trading revenues or investments revenues depending on the business activity.
the fair value of otc financial instruments, including derivative contracts related to financial instruments and commodities, is presented in the accompanying balance sheet on a net-by-counterparty basis, when appropriate. additionally, the firm nets the fair value of cash collateral paid or received against the fair value amounts recognized for net derivative positions executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting agreement.
fair value option the firm has elected to measure certain eligible instruments at fair value, including securities purchased under agreements to resell, loans and lending commitments, equity method investments and certain other assets, deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, other secured financings and borrowings.
fair value measurement-definition and hierarchy fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the "exit price") in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure. therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, assumptions are set to reflect those that the firm believes market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. where the firm manages a group of financial assets, financial liabilities, and nonfinancial items accounted for as derivatives on the basis of its net exposure to either market risks or credit risk, the firm measures the fair value of that group of financial instruments consistently with how market participants would price the net risk exposure at the measurement date.
in determining fair value, the firm uses various valuation approaches and establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that requires the most observable inputs be used when available.
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability that were developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the firm. unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect assumptions the firm believes other market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability that are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. the fair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the observability of inputs as follows, with level 1 being the highest and level 3 being the lowest level:
december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements level 1.  valuations based on quoted prices in active markets that the firm has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities. valuation adjustments, block discounts and discounts for entity-specific and contractual restrictions that would not transfer to market participants are not applied to level 1 instruments. since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment.
level 2.  valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, significant market inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, or market-corroborated inputs.
level 3.  valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
the availability of observable inputs can vary from product to product and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of product, whether the product is new and not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets and other characteristics particular to the product. to the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the firm in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
the firm considers prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including during periods of market dislocation. in periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. this condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified from level 1 to level 2 or from level 2 to level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. in such cases, the total fair value amount is disclosed in the level appropriate for the lowest level input that is significant to the total fair value of the asset or liability.
valuation techniques many cash instruments and otc derivative contracts have bid and ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace. bid prices reflect the highest price that a party is willing to pay for an asset. ask prices represent the lowest price that a party is willing to accept for an asset. the firm carries positions at the point within the bid-ask range that meets its best estimate of fair value. for offsetting positions in the same financial instrument, the same price within the bid-ask spread is used to measure both the long and short positions.
fair value for many cash instruments and otc derivative contracts is derived using pricing models. pricing models take into account the contract terms, as well as multiple inputs, including, where applicable, commodity prices, equity prices, interest rate yield curves, credit curves, correlation, creditworthiness of the counterparty, creditworthiness of the firm, option volatility and currency rates.
where appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account for various factors such as liquidity risk (bid-ask adjustments), credit quality, model uncertainty, and concentration risk and funding in order to arrive at fair value. adjustments for liquidity risk adjust model-derived mid-market amounts of level 2 and level 3 financial instruments for the bid-mid or mid-ask spread required to properly reflect the exit price of a risk position. bid-mid and mid-ask spreads are marked to levels observed in trade activity, broker quotes or other external third-party data. where these spreads are unobservable for the particular position in question, spreads are derived from observable levels of similar positions.
the firm applies credit-related valuation adjustments to its borrowings for which the fair value option was elected and to otc derivatives. the firm considers the impact of changes in its own credit spreads based upon observations of the secondary bond market spreads when measuring the fair value for borrowings.
for otc derivatives, which are recognized in trading assets at fair value in the balance sheet, the impact of changes in both the firm's and the counterparty's credit rating is considered when measuring fair value. in determining the expected exposure, the firm simulates the distribution of the future exposure to a counterparty, then applies market-based default probabilities to the future exposure, leveraging external third-party cds spread data. where cds spread data are unavailable for a specific counterparty, bond market spreads, cds spread data based on the counterparty's credit rating or cds spread data that reference a comparable counterparty may be utilized. the firm also considers collateral held and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate its exposure to each counterparty.
adjustments for model uncertainty are taken for positions whose underlying models are reliant on significant inputs that are neither directly nor indirectly observable, hence requiring reliance on established theoretical concepts in their derivation. these adjustments are derived by making assessments of the possible degree of variability using statistical approaches and market-based information where possible.
the firm may apply concentration adjustments to certain of its otc derivative portfolios to reflect the additional cost of closing out a particularly large risk exposure. where possible, these adjustments are based on observable market information, but in many instances, significant judgment is required to estimate the costs of closing out concentrated risk exposures due to the lack of liquidity in the marketplace.
the firm applies an fva in the fair value measurements of otc uncollateralized or partially collateralized derivatives december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements and in collateralized derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not permit the reuse of the collateral received. in general, fva reflects a market funding risk premium inherent in the noted derivative instruments. the methodology for measuring fva leverages the firm's existing credit-related valuation adjustment calculation methodologies, which apply to both assets and liabilities.
see note 4 for a description of valuation techniques applied to the major categories of financial instruments measured at fair value.
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis certain of the firm's assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. the firm incurs losses or gains for any adjustments of these assets or liabilities to fair value.
for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, fair value is determined by using various valuation approaches. the same hierarchy for inputs as described above, which requires that observable inputs be used when available, is used in measuring fair value for these items.
for further information on financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis, see note 4.
offsetting of derivative instruments in connection with its derivative activities, the firm generally enters into master netting agreements and collateral agreements with its counterparties. these agreements provide the firm with the right, in the event of a default by the counterparty, to net a counterparty's rights and obligations under the agreement and to liquidate and set off cash collateral against any net amount owed by the counterparty. derivatives with enforceable master netting agreements are reported net of cash collateral received and posted.
however, in certain circumstances, the firm may not have such an agreement in place; the relevant insolvency regime may not support the enforceability of the master netting agreement or collateral agreement; or the firm may not have sought legal advice to support the enforceability of the agreement. in cases where the firm has not determined an agreement to be enforceable, the related amounts are not offset (see note 6).
the firm's policy is generally to receive cash and/or securities posted as collateral (with rights of rehypothecation) in connection with derivative transactions, irrespective of the enforceability determination regarding the master netting and collateral agreement. in certain cases, the firm may agree for such collateral to be posted by the counterparty to a third-party custodian under a control agreement that enables it to take control of such collateral in the event of a counterparty default. the enforceability of the master netting agreement is taken into account in the firm's risk management practices and application of counterparty credit limits.
for information related to offsetting of derivatives, see note 6.
hedge accounting the firm applies hedge accounting using various derivative financial instruments for the following types of hedges: hedges of changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities due to the risk being hedged (fair value hedges); hedges of variability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate assets due to contractually specified interest rates (cash flow hedges) and hedges of net investments in foreign operations whose functional currency is different from the reporting currency of the parent company (net investment hedges). these financial instruments are included within trading assets-derivative and other contracts or trading liabilities-derivative and other contracts in the balance sheet. for hedges where hedge accounting is being applied, the firm performs effectiveness testing and other procedures. the change in the fair value of the designated portion of the hedging instrument should be highly correlated, between 80 and 125 percent of the change in the fair value, cash flows, or carrying value (due to translation gains or losses) of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. the firm considers the impact of valuation adjustments related to counterparty credit spreads and its own credit spreads to determine whether they would cause the hedging relationship to be ineffective.
fair value hedges-interest rate risk the firm's designated fair value hedges consist of interest rate swaps designated as hedges of changes in the benchmark interest rate of certain fixed rate afs securities and senior borrowings. the firm also designates interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of changes in the benchmark interest rate of certain fixed rate deposits. the firm is permitted to hedge the full, or part of the contractual term of the hedged instrument. the firm uses regression analysis to perform an ongoing prospective and retrospective assessment of the effectiveness of these hedging relationships. for qualifying fair value hedges of benchmark interest rates, the change in the fair value of the derivative, offset by the change in the fair value attributable to the change in the benchmark interest rate risk of the hedged asset (liability), is recognized in earnings each period as a component of interest income (expense). for afs securities, the change in fair value of the hedged item due to changes other than the risk being hedged will continue to be reported in oci. when a derivative is de-designated as a hedge, any basis adjustment remaining on the hedged asset (liability) is amortized to interest income (expense) over the remaining life of the asset (liability) using the effective interest method.
december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements net investment hedges the firm uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage a portion of the currency exposure relating to its net investments in foreign operations. to the extent that the notional amounts of the hedging instruments equal the portion of the investments being hedged and the underlying exchange rate of the derivative hedging instrument is the same as the exchange rate between the functional currency of the investee and the intermediate parent entity's functional currency, it is considered to be perfectly effective. the gain or loss from revaluing hedges of net investments in foreign operations at the spot rate is reported within aoci. the forward points on the hedging instruments are excluded from hedge effectiveness testing and changes in the fair value of this excluded component are recorded currently in interest income.
cash flow hedges-interest rate risk the firm's designated cash flow hedges consist of interest rate derivatives designated as hedges of variability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate assets due to changes in the contractually specified interest rates. the firm uses regression analysis to perform an ongoing prospective and retrospective assessment of the effectiveness of these hedging relationships.
the objective of this strategy is to hedge the risk of changes in the hedged item's cash flows attributable to changes in the contractually specified interest rate. for qualifying cash flow hedges of contractually specified interest rates, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in oci and subsequently reclassified to earnings in the same periods when the hedged item affects earnings. if cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued, aoci is released into earnings immediately if the cash flow of the hedged item is probable of not occurring. otherwise the amount in aoci is released into earnings as the forecasted transaction affects earnings.
other hedges in addition to hedges that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting, the firm uses derivatives to economically hedge credit risk associated with certain held-for-sale and held-for-investment corporate loans and lending commitments, and the related gains and losses are reported within other revenues in the income statement.
for further information on derivative instruments and hedging activities, see note 6.
afs investment securities afs securities are reported at fair value in the balance sheet. interest income, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, is included in interest income in the income statement. unrealized gains are recorded in oci, and unrealized losses are recorded either in oci or in other revenues as described below.
afs securities in an unrealized loss position are first evaluated to determine whether there is an intent to sell or it is more likely than not the firm will be required to sell before recovery of the amortized cost basis. if so, the amortized cost basis is written down to the fair value of the security such that the entire unrealized loss is recognized in other revenues, and any previously established acl is written off.
for all other afs securities in an unrealized loss position, any portion of unrealized losses representing a credit loss is recognized in other revenues and as an increase to the acl for afs securities, with the remainder of unrealized losses recognized in oci. a credit loss exists if the firm does not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the security. when considering whether a credit loss exists, the firm considers relevant information, including:
•guarantees (implicit or explicit) by the u.s. government;
•the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis;
•adverse conditions specifically related to the security, its industry or geographic area;
•changes in the financial condition of the issuer of the security or, in the case of an asset-backed debt security, changes in the financial condition of the underlying loan obligors;
•the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future;
•failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments;
•the current rating and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency.
if a credit loss exists, the firm measures the credit loss as the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected (discounted at the implicit interest rate at acquisition of the security or discounted at the effective yield for securities that incorporate changes in prepayment assumptions) and the amortized cost basis of the security. changes in prepayment assumptions alone are not considered to result in a credit loss. when estimating the present value of expected cash flows, information utilized includes the remaining payment terms of the security, prepayment speeds, financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults and the value of any underlying collateral.

htm securities htm securities are reported at amortized cost, net of any acl, in the balance sheet. refer to "allowance for credit losses" herein for guidance on the acl determination. interest income, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on htm securities, is included in interest income in the income statement.
loans the firm accounts for loans based on the following categories: loans held for investment; loans held for sale; and loans at fair value.
nonaccrual and acl charge-offs on loans all loan categories described below follow the same nonaccrual and charge-off guidance as discussed in "allowance for credit losses" herein.
loans held for investment loans held for investment are reported at amortized cost, which consists of the outstanding principle balance adjusted for any charge-offs, the allowance for credit losses, any unamortized deferred fees or costs for originated loans, and any unamortized premiums or discounts for purchased loans.
interest income.  interest income on performing loans held for investment is accrued and recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of interest. purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are amortized into interest income over the life of the loan to produce a level rate of return.
lending commitments.  the firm records the liability and related expense for the credit exposure related to commitments to fund loans. the liability is recorded in other liabilities in the balance sheet and the expense is recorded in the provision for credit losses in the income statement. for more information regarding loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, see note 14.
for more information regarding allowance for credit losses, refer to "allowance for credit losses" herein.
loans held for sale loans held for sale are measured at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in other revenues. the firm determines the valuation allowance on an individual loan basis, except for residential mortgage loans for which the valuation allowance is determined at the loan product level. any decreases in fair value below the initial carrying amount and any recoveries in fair value up to the initial carrying amount are recorded in other revenues. increases in fair value above initial carrying value are not recognized.
interest income. interest income on loans held for sale is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiums are deferred as an adjustment to the loan's cost basis until the related loan is sold and, as such, are included in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale.
lending commitments. commitments to fund mortgage loans held for sale are derivatives and are reported in trading assets or trading liabilities in the balance sheet and in trading revenues in the income statement.
for commitments to fund non-mortgage loans, the firm records the liability and related expense for the fair value exposure below cost of such commitments in other liabilities and accrued expenses in the balance sheet with an offset to other revenues in the income statement.
because loans and lending commitments held for sale are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the allowance for credit losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans.
loans at fair value loans for which the fair value option is elected are carried at fair value and included in trading assets in the balance sheet, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets, see note 4.
lending commitments. the firm records the liability and related expense for the fair value exposure related to commitments to fund loans that will be measured at fair value. the liability is recorded in trading liabilities in the balance sheet, and the expense is recorded in trading revenues in the income statement.
because such loans and lending commitments are reported at fair value, the allowance for credit losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans.
for further information on loans, see note 9. for more information regarding loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, see note 14.
allowance for credit losses the acl for financial instruments measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet exposures (e.g., hfi loans and lending commitments, htm securities, customer and other receivables and certain guarantees) represents an december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements estimate of expected credit losses over the entire life of the financial instrument.
factors considered by management when determining the acl include payment status, fair value of collateral and expected payments of principal and interest, as well as internal or external information relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. the firm uses three forecasts that include assumptions about certain macroeconomic variables, including, but not limited to, u.s. gross domestic product ("gdp"), equity market indices and unemployment rates, as well as commercial real estate and home price indices. at the conclusion of the firm's reasonable and supportable forecast period of 13 quarters, there is a gradual reversion back to historical averages.
the acl is measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist for multiple instruments, considering all available information relevant to assessing the collectability of cash flows. generally, the firm applies a probability of default/loss given default model for instruments that are collectively assessed, under which the acl is calculated as the product of probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. these parameters are forecast for each collective group of assets using a scenario-based statistical model.
if the instrument does not share similar risk characteristics with other instruments, including when it is probable that the firm will be unable to collect the full payment of principal and interest on the instrument when due, the acl is measured on an individual basis. the firm generally applies a discounted cash flow method for instruments that are individually assessed.
the firm may also elect to use an approach that considers the fair value of the collateral when measuring the acl if the loan is collateral dependent (i.e., repayment of the loan is expected to be provided substantially by the sale or operation of the underlying collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty).
additionally, the firm can elect to use an approach to measure the acl that considers the fair value of collateral where the borrower is required to, and reasonably expected to, continually adjust and replenish the amount of collateral securing the instrument to reflect changes in the fair value of such collateral. the firm has elected to use this approach for certain securities-based loans, margin loans, securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed.
credit quality indicators considered in developing the acl include:
•corporate loans, secured lending facilities, commercial real estate loans and securities, and other loans: internal risk ratings developed by the crm that are refreshed at least annually, and more frequently as necessary. these ratings generally correspond to external ratings published by s&p. the firm also considers transaction structure, including type of collateral, collateral terms and position of the obligation within the capital structure. in addition, for commercial real estate, the firm considers property type and location, net operating income and ltv ratios, among other factors, as well as commercial real estate price and credit spread indices and capitalization rates.
•residential real estate loans: loan origination fair isaac corporation ("fico") credit scores as determined by independent credit agencies in the u.s. and ltv ratios.
•employee loans: employment status, which includes those currently employed by the firm and for which the firm can deduct any unpaid amounts due to it through certain compensation arrangements; and those no longer employed by the firm where such arrangements are no longer applicable.
qualitative and environmental factors such as economic and business conditions, the nature and volume of the portfolio, and lending terms and the volume and severity of past due loans are also considered in the acl calculations.
presentation of acl and provision for credit losses acl                                          provision for credit losses held for investment loans                                                                                      contra asset                                 provision for credit losses other instruments measured at amortized cost (e.g., htm securities and customer and other receivables)         contra asset                                 other revenues employee loans                                                                                                 contra asset                                 compensation and benefits expenses held for investment lending commitments                                                                        other liabilities and accrued expenses       provision for credit losses other off-balance sheet instruments (e.g., certain guarantees)                                                 other liabilities and accrued expenses       other expenses nonaccrual the firm places financial instruments on nonaccrual status if principal or interest is not expected when contractually due or is past due for a period of 90 days or more unless the obligation is well-secured and is in the process of collection.
for any instrument placed on nonaccrual status, the firm reverses any unpaid interest accrued with an offsetting reduction to interest income. principal and interest payments received on nonaccrual instruments are applied to principal if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal. if collection of the principal is not in doubt, interest income is realized on a cash basis. if the instrument is brought current and neither principal nor interest collection is in doubt, instruments can generally return to accrual status, and interest income can be recognized.
acl charge-offs the principal balance of a financial instrument is charged off in the period it is deemed uncollectible, resulting in a reduction in the acl and in the balance of the financial instrument in the balance sheet. accrued interest receivable december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements balances that are separately recorded from the related financial instruments are charged off against interest income when the related financial instrument is placed on nonaccrual status. accordingly, the firm elected not to measure an acl for accrued interest receivables.
transfers of financial assets transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when the firm has relinquished control over the transferred assets. any related gain or loss on sale is recorded in net revenues. transfers that are not accounted for as sales are treated as collateralized financings. securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financings (see note 8).
securities purchased under agreements to resell ("reverse repurchase agreements") and securities sold under agreements to repurchase ("repurchase agreements"), including repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements-to-maturity, are carried in the balance sheet at the amount of cash paid or received plus accrued interest except for certain reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements for which the firm has elected the fair value option (see note 5). where appropriate, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis. securities borrowed and securities loaned are recorded at the amount of cash collateral advanced or received.
in instances where the firm is the lender in securities-for-securities transactions and is permitted to sell or repledge these securities, the fair value of the collateral received is reported in trading assets, and the related obligation to return the collateral is reported in trading liabilities in the balance sheet. securities-for-securities transactions where the firm is the borrower are not included in the balance sheet.
in order to manage credit exposure arising from these transactions, in appropriate circumstances, the firm enters into master netting agreements and collateral agreements with its counterparties. these agreements provide the firm with the right, in the event of a default by the counterparty, to net a counterparty's rights and obligations under the agreement and to liquidate and set off collateral held by the firm against the net amount owed by the counterparty.
the firm's policy is generally to take possession of securities purchased or borrowed in connection with reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions, respectively, and to receive cash and/or securities delivered under repurchase agreements or securities loaned transactions (with rights of rehypothecation).
for information related to offsetting of certain collateralized transactions, see note 8.
premises, equipment and capitalized software costs premises, equipment and capitalized software costs consist of buildings, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures, computer and communications equipment, power generation assets and capitalized software (externally purchased and developed for internal use). premises, equipment and capitalized software costs are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization and are included in other assets in the balance sheet. depreciation and amortization are provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset.

capitalized software costs                                       2 to 10
premises, equipment and capitalized software costs are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset's carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
goodwill and intangible assets the firm tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. the firm tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below the asset's business segment. the firm tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the aggregate level of management contracts. for both the annual and interim tests, the firm has the option to either (i) perform a quantitative impairment test or (ii) first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, in which case, the quantitative test would be performed.
when performing a quantitative impairment test, the firm compares the fair value with the carrying amount. if the fair value is less than the carrying amount, the impairment loss is equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, limited to the carrying amount.
the estimated fair values are derived based on valuation techniques the firm believes market participants would use. the estimated fair values are generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology or methodologies that incorporate price-to-book and price-to-earnings multiples of certain comparable companies for goodwill impairment testing.
december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements intangible assets with a finite life are amortized over their estimated useful life and are reviewed for impairment on an interim basis when impairment indicators are present. impairment losses are recorded within other expenses in the income statement.
earnings per common share basic eps is computed by dividing earnings available to morgan stanley common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. earnings available to morgan stanley common shareholders represents net income applicable to morgan stanley reduced by preferred stock dividends. common shares outstanding include common stock and vested rsus where recipients have satisfied the relevant vesting terms. diluted eps reflects the assumed conversion of all dilutive securities.
share-based awards that pay dividend equivalents subject to vesting are included in diluted shares outstanding (if dilutive) under the treasury stock method.
the firm has granted psus that vest and convert to shares of common stock only if predetermined performance and market goals are satisfied. since the issuance of the shares is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, the psus are included in diluted eps based on the number of shares (if any) that would be issuable if the reporting date was the end of the performance period.
for further information on diluted earnings (loss) per common share, see note 17 to the financial statements.
deferred compensation stock-based compensation the firm measures compensation expense for stock-based awards at fair value. the firm determines the fair value of rsus (including psus with non-market performance conditions) based on the grant-date fair value of its common stock, measured as the volume-weighted average price on the date of grant ("vwap"). the fair value of rsus not entitled to dividends until conversion is measured at vwap reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares prior to scheduled conversion date. psus that contain market-based conditions are valued using a monte carlo valuation model.
compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period relevant to each separately vesting portion of the award. compensation expense for awards with performance conditions is recognized based on the probable outcome of the performance condition at each reporting date. compensation expense for awards with market-based conditions is recognized irrespective of the probability of the market condition being achieved and is not reversed if the market condition is not met. the firm accounts for forfeitures as they occur.
stock-based awards generally contain clawback and cancellation provisions. certain awards provide the firm discretion to claw back or cancel all or a portion of the award under specified circumstances. where award terms are considered to be subjective, a grant date cannot be established and the awards are subject to variable accounting which requires that compensation expense for those awards is adjusted for changes in the fair value of the firm's common stock or the relevant model valuation, as appropriate, until conversion, exercise or expiration. following amendments to clarify specific subjective award terms in the second quarter of 2023, a grant date for the awards was established such that compensation expense for those awards is no longer adjusted for changes in the fair value of the firm's common stock. the firm also operates an employee stock purchase plan ("espp") which allows eligible employees of the firm to purchase shares of morgan stanley at a discount.
employee stock trusts in connection with certain stock-based compensation plans, the firm has established employee stock trusts to provide, at its discretion, common stock voting rights to certain rsu holders. following the grant of an rsu award, when a stock trust is utilized, the firm contributes shares to be held in the stock trust until the rsus convert to common shares. the assets of the employee stock trusts are consolidated with those of the firm and are generally accounted for in a manner similar to treasury stock, where the shares of common stock outstanding reported in common stock issued to employee stock trusts are offset by an equal amount reported in employee stock trusts in the balance sheet.
the firm uses the grant-date fair value of stock-based compensation as the basis for recording the movement of the assets to or from the employee stock trusts. changes in the fair value are not recognized as the firm's stock-based compensation must be settled by delivery of a fixed number of shares of the firm's common stock.
deferred cash-based compensation compensation expense for dcp awards is calculated based on the notional value of the award granted, adjusted for changes in the fair value of the referenced investments that employees select. compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period relevant to each separately vesting portion of deferred awards.
the firm invests directly, as a principal, in financial instruments and other investments to economically hedge certain of its obligations under its dcp. changes in the value of such investments are recorded in trading revenues and investments revenues. although changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments made by the firm, there is typically a timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on the firm's investments and december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period.
retirement-eligible employee compensation for year-end stock-based awards and dcp awards anticipated to be granted to retirement-eligible employees under award terms that do not contain a future service requirement, the firm accrues the estimated cost of the awards over the course of the calendar year preceding the grant date, which reflects the period over which the compensation is earned.
carried interest compensation the firm generally recognizes compensation expense for any portion of carried interest (both realized and unrealized) that is allocated to employees. for information on performance-based fees in the form of carried interest, which are directly related to carried interest compensation, see "revenue recognition-carried interest" herein.
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based upon the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income tax expense (benefit) in the period that includes the enactment date. such effects are recorded in provision for income taxes regardless of where deferred taxes were originally recorded.
the firm recognizes net deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. in making such a determination, the firm considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and results of recent operations. when performing the assessment, the firm considers all types of deferred tax assets in combination with each other, regardless of the origin of the underlying temporary difference. if a deferred tax asset is determined to be unrealizable, a valuation allowance is established. if the firm subsequently determines that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount, it would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.
the firm recognizes tax expense associated with global intangible low-taxed income as it is incurred as part of the current income taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period.
uncertain tax positions are recorded on the basis of a two-step process, whereby (i) the firm determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (ii) for those tax positions that meet this threshold, the firm recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes.
foreign currencies assets and liabilities of operations with non-u.s. dollar functional currencies are translated at year-end rates of exchange. gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements, net of hedge gains or losses and related tax effects, are reflected in aoci in the balance sheet. gains or losses resulting from remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are included in net income, and amounts recognized in the income statement are translated at the rate of exchange on the respective date of recognition for each amount.
accounting updates adopted in 2023
fair value measurement - equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions the firm early adopted the fair value measurement of equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions accounting update on july 1, 2023, with no material impact on the firm's financial condition or results of operations upon adoption. the update clarifies that a contractual sale restriction is not considered part of the unit of account of an equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value.
financial instruments - credit losses the firm adopted the financial instruments-credit losses accounting update on january 1, 2023, with no impact on the firm's financial condition or results of operations upon adoption.
this accounting update eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings ("tdrs") and requires new disclosures regarding certain modifications of financing receivables (i.e., principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant payment delays and term extensions) to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. the update also requires disclosure of current period gross charge-offs by year of origination for financing receivables measured at amortized cost. refer to note 9, loans, lending commitments and related allowance for credit losses, for the new disclosures.
accounting update adopted in 2022
reference rate reform the firm has adopted the reference rate reform accounting update, which extends the period of time entities can utilize the reference rate reform relief guidance from december 31, 2022 to december 31, 2024. the relief provides optional december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference libor or other interest rate benchmarks for which the referenced rate is expected to be discontinued or replaced. the firm is applying the accounting relief as relevant contract and hedge accounting relationship modifications are made during the course of the reference rate reform transition period. there was no impact to the firm's financial statements upon issuance of this accounting standard update.

valuation techniques for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis u.s. treasury and agency securities u.s. treasury securities valuation technique:
•fair value is determined using quoted market prices.
valuation hierarchy classification:
•level 1-as inputs are observable and in an active market u.s. agency securities valuation techniques:
•non-callable agency-issued debt securities are generally valued using quoted market prices, and callable agency-issued debt securities are valued by benchmarking model-derived prices to quoted market prices and trade data for comparable instruments.
•the fair value of agency mortgage pass-through pool securities is model-driven based on spreads of comparable to-be-announced securities.
•cmos are generally valued using quoted market prices and trade data adjusted by subsequent changes in related indices for comparable instruments.
valuation hierarchy classification:
•level 1-on-the-run agency issued debt securities if actively traded and inputs are observable
•level 2-all other agency issued debt securities, agency mortgage pass-through pool securities and cmos if actively traded and inputs are observable
•level 3-in instances where the trading activity is limited or inputs are unobservable other sovereign government obligations valuation techniques:
•fair value is determined using quoted prices in active markets when available. when not available, quoted prices in less active markets are used. in the absence of position-specific quoted prices, fair value may be determined through benchmarking from comparable instruments.
valuation hierarchy classification:
•level 1-if actively traded and inputs are observable
•level 2-if the market is less active or prices are dispersed
•level 3-in instances where the prices are unobservable state and municipal securities valuation techniques:
•fair value is determined using recently executed transactions, market price quotations or pricing models that factor in, where applicable, interest rates, bond or cds spreads, adjusted for any basis difference between cash and derivative instruments.
valuation hierarchy classification:
•level 2-if value based on observable market data supported by market liquidity for comparable instruments
•level 3-in instances where market data are not observable or supported by market liquidity december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements mortgage- and asset-backed securities valuation techniques:
•mortgage- and asset-backed securities may be valued based on price or spread data obtained from observed transactions or independent external parties such as vendors or brokers.
•when position-specific external price data are not observable, the fair value determination may require benchmarking to comparable instruments, and/or analyzing expected credit losses, default and recovery rates, and/or applying discounted cash flow techniques. when evaluating the comparable instruments for use in the valuation of each security, security collateral-specific attributes, including payment priority, credit enhancement levels, type of collateral, delinquency rates and loss severity, are considered. in addition, for rmbs borrowers, fico scores and the level of documentation for the loan are considered.
•market standard cash flow models may be utilized to model the specific collateral composition and cash flow structure of each transaction. key inputs to these models are market spreads, forecasted credit losses, and default and prepayment rates for each asset category.
•valuation levels of rmbs and cmbs indices are used as an additional data point for benchmarking purposes or to price outright index positions.
valuation hierarchy classification:
•level 2-if value based on observable market data supported by market liquidity for comparable instruments
•level 3-if external prices or significant spread inputs are unobservable or not supported by market liquidity or if the comparability assessment involves significant subjectivity related to property type differences, cash flows, performance or other inputs loans and lending commitments valuation techniques:
•fair value of corporate loans is determined using recently executed transactions, market price quotations (where observable), implied yields from comparable debt, market observable cds spread levels obtained from independent external parties adjusted for any basis difference between cash and derivative instruments, along with proprietary valuation models and default recovery analysis where such transactions and quotations are unobservable.
•fair value of contingent corporate lending commitments is determined by using executed transactions on comparable loans and the anticipated market price based on pricing indications from syndicate banks and customers. the valuation of loans and lending commitments also takes into account fee income that is considered an attribute of the contract.
•fair value of mortgage loans is determined using observable prices based on transactional data or third-party pricing for comparable instruments, when available.
•where position-specific external prices are not observable, fair value is estimated based on benchmarking to prices and rates observed in the primary market for similar loan or borrower types or based on the present value of expected future cash flows using the firm's best available estimates of the key assumptions, including forecasted credit losses, prepayment rates, forward yield curves and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved or a methodology that utilizes the capital structure and credit spreads of recent comparable securitization transactions.
•fair value of equity margin loans is determined by discounting future interest cash flows, net of potential losses resulting from large downward price movements of the underlying margin loan collateral. the potential losses are modeled using the margin loan rate, which is calibrated from market observable cds spreads, implied debt yields or volatility metrics of the loan collateral.

•level 2-if value based on observable market data supported by market liquidity for comparable instruments
•level 3-in instances where prices or significant spread inputs are unobservable or not supported by market liquidity or if the comparability assessment involves significant subjectivity corporate and other debt corporate bonds valuation techniques:
•fair value is determined using recently executed transactions, market price quotations, bond spreads and cds spreads obtained from independent external parties, such as vendors and brokers, adjusted for any basis difference between cash and derivative instruments.
•the spread data used are for the same maturity as the bond. if the spread data do not reference the issuer, then data that reference comparable issuers are used. when position-specific external price data are not observable, fair value is determined based on either benchmarking to comparable instruments or cash flow models with yield curves, bond or single-name cds spreads and recovery rates or loss given default as significant inputs.
valuation hierarchy classification:
•level 2-if value based on observable market data for comparable instruments
•level 3-in instances where prices or significant spread inputs are unobservable or if the comparability assessment involves significant subjectivity cdos valuation techniques:
•the firm holds cash cdos that typically reference a tranche of an underlying synthetic portfolio of single-name cds spreads collateralized by corporate bonds ("cln") or cash portfolio of abs/loans ("asset-backed cdos").
•credit correlation, a primary input used to determine the fair value of clns, is usually unobservable and derived using a benchmarking technique. other model inputs, such as credit spreads, including collateral spreads and interest rates, are typically observable.
•asset-backed cdos are valued based on an evaluation of the market and model input parameters sourced from comparable instruments as indicated by market activity.
december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements each asset-backed cdo position is evaluated independently taking into consideration available comparable market levels, underlying collateral performance and pricing, deal structures and liquidity.
valuation hierarchy classification:

•level 3-when either comparable market transactions are unobservable or the credit correlation input is significant equity contracts with financing features valuation techniques:
•fair value of certain equity contracts, which are not classified as otc derivatives because they do not meet the net investment criteria, is determined by discounting future interest cash flows, inclusive of the estimated value of the embedded optionality. the valuation uses the same derivative pricing models and valuation techniques as described under "otc derivative contracts" herein.

•level 2-when not actively traded otc derivative contracts valuation techniques:
•otc derivative contracts include forward, swap and option contracts related to interest rates, foreign currencies, credit standing of reference entities, equity prices or commodity prices.
•depending on the product and the terms of the transaction, the fair value of otc derivative products can be modeled using a series of techniques, including closed-form analytic formulas, such as the black-scholes option-pricing model, simulation models or a combination thereof. many pricing models do not entail material subjectivity as the methodologies employed do not necessitate significant judgment since model inputs may be observed from actively quoted markets, as is the case for generic interest rate swaps, many equity, commodity and foreign currency option contracts, and certain cds. in the case of more established derivative products, the pricing models used by the firm are widely accepted by the financial services industry.
•more complex otc derivative products are typically less liquid and require more judgment in the implementation of the valuation technique since direct trading activity or quotes are unobservable. this includes certain types of interest rate derivatives with both volatility and correlation exposure, equity, commodity or foreign currency derivatives that are either longer-dated or include exposure to multiple underlyings, and credit derivatives, including cds on certain mortgage- or asset-backed securities and basket cds. where required inputs are unobservable, relationships to observable data points, based on historical and/or implied observations, may be employed as a technique to estimate the model input values. for further information on the valuation techniques for otc derivative products, see note 2.

•exchange-traded direct equity investments are generally valued based on quoted prices from the exchange.
•for direct investments, initially, the transaction price is generally considered by the firm as the exit price and is its best estimate of fair value.

1.net transfers in 2021 reflect the transfer in the third quarter of $895 million of equity margin loans from level 3 to level 2 as a result of the reduced significance of the margin loan rate input.
2.net transfers in 2021 reflect the transfer in the second quarter of $2.0 billion of corporate and other debt, $1.0 billion of net equity derivatives and $2.2 billion of borrowings from level 3 to level 2 as the unobservable inputs were not significant to the overall fair value measurements.
3.net transfers in 2021 reflect the transfer in the first quarter of $2.5 billion of afs securities from level 3 to level 2 due to increased trading activity and observability of pricing inputs.
level 3 instruments may be hedged with instruments classified in level 1 and level 2. the realized and unrealized gains or losses for assets and liabilities within the level 3 category presented in the previous tables do not reflect the related realized and unrealized gains or losses on hedging instruments that have been classified by the firm within the level 1 and/or level 2 categories.
the unrealized gains (losses) during the period for assets and liabilities within the level 3 category may include changes in fair value during the period that were attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs. total realized and unrealized gains (losses) are primarily included in trading revenues in the income statement.
additionally, in the previous tables, consolidations of vies are included in purchases, and deconsolidations of vies are included in settlements.

1.a single amount is disclosed for range and average when there is no significant difference between the minimum, maximum and average. amounts represent weighted averages except where simple averages and the median of the inputs are more relevant.
2.includes derivative contracts with multiple risks (i.e., hybrid products).
the previous table provides information on the valuation techniques, significant unobservable inputs, and the ranges and averages for each major category of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis with a significant level 3 balance. the level of aggregation and breadth of products cause the range of inputs to be wide and not evenly distributed across the inventory of financial instruments. further, the range of unobservable inputs may differ across firms in the financial services industry because of diversity in the types of products included in each firm's inventory. generally, there are no predictable relationships between multiple significant unobservable inputs attributable to a given valuation technique.
december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements during 2023, there were no significant revisions made to the descriptions of the firm's significant unobservable inputs.
an increase (decrease) to the following significant unobservable inputs would generally result in a higher (lower) fair value.
•comparable bond or loan price. a pricing input used when prices for the identical instrument are not available. significant subjectivity may be involved when fair value is determined using pricing data available for comparable instruments. valuation using comparable instruments can be done by calculating an implied yield (or spread over a liquid benchmark) from the price of a comparable bond or loan, then adjusting that yield (or spread) to derive a value for the bond or loan. the adjustment to yield (or spread) should account for relevant differences in the bonds or loans, such as maturity or credit quality. alternatively, a price-to-price basis can be assumed between the comparable instrument and the bond or loan being valued in order to establish the value of the bond or loan.
•comparable equity price. a price derived from equity raises, share buybacks and external bid levels, etc. a discount or premium may be included in the fair value estimate.
•contingency probability. probability associated with the realization of an underlying event upon which the value of an asset is contingent.
•ebitda multiple/exit multiple. the ratio of enterprise value to ebitda, where enterprise value is the aggregate value of equity and debt minus cash and cash equivalents. the ebitda multiple reflects the value of a company in terms of its full-year ebitda, whereas the exit multiple reflects the value of a company in terms of its full-year expected ebitda at exit. either multiple allows comparison between companies from an operational perspective as the effect of capital structure, taxation and depreciation/amortization is excluded.
an increase (decrease) to the following significant unobservable inputs would generally result in a lower (higher) fair value.
•cash-synthetic basis. the measure of the price differential between cash financial instruments and their synthetic derivative-based equivalents. the range disclosed in the previous table signifies the number of points by which the synthetic bond equivalent price is higher than the quoted price of the underlying cash bonds.
•funding spread. the cost of borrowing defined as the incremental spread over the ois rate for a specific collateral rate (which refers to the rate applicable to a specific type of security pledged as collateral).
•loss given default. amount expressed as a percentage of par that is the expected loss when a credit event occurs.
•margin loan rate. the annualized rate that reflects the possibility of losses as a result of movements in the price of the underlying margin loan collateral. the rate is calibrated from the discount rate, credit spreads and/or volatility measures.
•wacc. wacc represents the theoretical rate of return required to debt and equity investors. the wacc is used in a discounted cash flow model that calculates the value of the equity. the model assumes that the cash flow assumptions, including projections, are fully reflected in the current equity value, while the debt to equity ratio is held constant.
an increase (decrease) to the following significant unobservable inputs would generally result in an impact to the fair value, but the magnitude and direction of the impact would depend on whether the firm is long or short the exposure.
•correlation. a pricing input where the payoff is driven by more than one underlying risk. correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movement of two variables (i.e., how the change in one variable influences a change in the other variable).
•credit spread. the credit spread reflects the additional net yield an investor can earn from a security with more credit risk relative to one with less credit risk. the credit spread of a particular security is often quoted in relation to the yield on a credit risk-free benchmark security or reference rate.
•interest rate curve. the term structure of interest rates (relationship between interest rates and the time to maturity) and a market's measure of future interest rates at the time of observation. an interest rate curve is used to set interest rate and foreign exchange derivative cash flows and is a pricing input used in the discounting of any otc derivative cash flow.
•volatility. the measure of variability in possible returns for an instrument given how much that instrument changes in value over time. volatility is a pricing input for options, and, generally, the lower the volatility, the less risky the option. the level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular option depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the risk underlying that option, the tenor and the strike price of the option.
•volatility skew. the measure of the difference in implied volatility for options with identical underliers and expiry dates but with different strikes.

amounts in the previous table represent the firm's carrying value of general and limited partnership interests in fund investments, as well as any related performance-based income in the form of carried interest. the carrying amounts are measured based on the nav of the fund taking into account the distribution terms applicable to the interest held. this same measurement applies whether the fund investments are accounted for under the equity method or fair value.
private equity.  funds that pursue multiple strategies, including leveraged buyouts, venture capital, infrastructure growth capital, distressed investments and mezzanine capital. in addition, the funds may be structured with a focus on specific geographic regions.
real estate.  funds that invest in real estate assets such as commercial office buildings, retail properties, multifamily residential properties, developments or hotels. in addition, the funds may be structured with a focus on specific geographic regions.
investments in private equity and real estate funds generally are not redeemable due to the closed-end nature of these funds. instead, distributions from each fund will be received as the underlying investments of the funds are disposed and monetized.
hedge.  funds that pursue various investment strategies, including long-short equity, fixed income/credit, event-driven and multi-strategy. investments in hedge funds may be subject to initial period lock-up or gate provisions, which restrict an investor from withdrawing from the fund during a certain initial period or restrict the redemption amount on any redemption date, respectively.

1.gains and losses for loans and other assets-other investments are classified in other revenues. for other items, gains and losses are recorded in other revenues if the item is held for sale; otherwise, they are recorded in other expenses.
2.nonrecurring changes in the fair value of loans and lending commitments, which exclude the impact of related economic hedges, are calculated as follows: for the held-for-investment category, based on the value of the underlying collateral; and for the held-for-sale category, based on recently executed transactions, market price quotations, valuation models that incorporate market observable inputs where possible, such as comparable loan or debt prices and cds spread levels adjusted for any basis difference between cash and derivative instruments, or default recovery analysis where such transactions and quotations are unobservable.
3.losses related to other assets-other investments were determined using techniques that included discounted cash flow models, methodologies that incorporate multiples of certain comparable companies and recently executed transactions.
4.losses related to other assets-premises, equipment and software generally include impairments as well as write-offs related to the disposal of certain assets.
5.losses related to other assets-rou assets include impairments related to the discontinued leased properties.

the firm enters into credit derivatives, principally cds, under which it receives or provides protection against the risk of default on a set of debt obligations issued by a specified reference entity or entities. a majority of the firm's counterparties for these derivatives are banks, broker-dealers, and insurance and other financial institutions.
the fair value amounts as shown in the previous tables are prior to cash collateral or counterparty netting.
the purchase of credit protection does not represent the sole manner in which the firm risk manages its exposure to credit derivatives. the firm manages its exposure to these derivative contracts through a variety of risk mitigation strategies, which include managing the credit and correlation risk across single-name, non-tranched indices and baskets, tranched indices and baskets, and cash positions. aggregate market risk limits have been established for credit derivatives, and market risk measures are routinely monitored against these limits. the firm may also recover amounts on the underlying reference obligation delivered to the firm under cds where credit protection was sold.
single-name cds.  a cds protects the buyer against the loss of principal on a bond or loan in case of a default by the issuer. the protection buyer pays a periodic premium (generally quarterly) over the life of the contract and is protected for the period. the firm, in turn, performs under a cds if a credit event as defined under the contract occurs. typical credit events include bankruptcy, dissolution or insolvency of the referenced entity, failure to pay and restructuring of the obligations of the referenced entity.
index and basket cds.  index and basket cds are products where credit protection is provided on a portfolio of single-name cds. generally, in the event of a default on one of the underlying names, the firm pays a pro rata portion of the total notional amount of the cds.
the firm also enters into tranched index and basket cds where credit protection is provided on a particular portion of the portfolio loss distribution. the most junior tranches cover initial defaults, and once losses exceed the notional of the
111               december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements tranche, they are passed on to the next most senior tranche in the capital structure.
other credit contracts.  the firm has invested in clns and cdos, which are hybrid instruments containing embedded derivatives, in which credit protection has been sold to the issuer of the note. if there is a credit event of a reference entity underlying the instrument, the principal balance of the note may not be repaid in full to the firm.

the firm actively manages its secured financings in a manner that reduces the potential refinancing risk of secured financings of less liquid assets and also considers the quality of collateral when negotiating collateral eligibility with counterparties. the firm utilizes shorter term secured financing for highly liquid assets and has established longer tenor limits for less liquid assets, for which funding may be at risk in the event of a market disruption.

margin and other lending         $45,644                    $38,524
the firm provides margin lending arrangements that allow customers to borrow against the value of qualifying securities. receivables from these arrangements are included within customer and other receivables in the balance sheet. under these arrangements, the firm receives collateral, which includes u.s. government and agency securities, other sovereign government obligations, corporate and other debt, and corporate equities. margin loans are collateralized by customer-owned securities held by the firm. the firm monitors required margin levels and established credit terms daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, requires customers to deposit additional collateral, or reduce positions, when necessary.
margin loans are extended on a demand basis and generally are not committed facilities. factors considered in the review of margin loans are the amount of the loan, the intended purpose, the degree of leverage being employed in the account and the amount of collateral, as well as an overall evaluation of the portfolio to ensure proper diversification or, in the case of concentrated positions, appropriate liquidity of the underlying collateral or potential hedging strategies to reduce risk. underlying collateral for margin loans is reviewed with respect to the liquidity of the proposed collateral positions, valuation of securities, historic trading range, volatility analysis and an evaluation of industry concentrations. for these transactions, adherence to the firm's collateral policies significantly limits its credit exposure in the event of a customer default. the firm may request additional margin collateral from customers, if appropriate, and, if necessary, may sell securities that have not been paid for or purchase securities sold but not delivered from customers.
also included in the amounts in the previous table is non-purpose securities-based lending on entities in the wealth management business segment.
other secured financings other secured financings include the liabilities related to collateralized notes, transfers of financial assets that are accounted for as financings rather than sales and consolidated vies where the firm is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. these liabilities are generally payable from the cash flows of the related assets accounted for as trading assets (see notes 13 and 15). additionally, for certain secured financing transactions that the firm entered into during 2023 that meet applicable netting criteria, the firm offsets other secured financing liabilities against financing receivables recorded within trading assets in the amount of $3,472 million at december 31, 2023.

credit quality the crm evaluates new obligors before credit transactions are initially approved and at least annually thereafter for corporate and commercial real estate loans. for corporate, secured lending facilities and other loans, credit evaluations typically involve the evaluation of financial statements, assessment of leverage, liquidity, capital strength, asset composition and quality, market capitalization and access to capital markets, cash flow projections and debt service requirements, and the adequacy of collateral, if applicable. the crm also evaluates strategy, market position, industry dynamics, obligor's management and other factors that could affect an obligor's risk profile.
for commercial real estate loans, the credit evaluation is focused on property and transaction metrics, including property type, ltv ratio, occupancy levels, debt service ratio, prevailing capitalization rates and market dynamics.
for residential real estate and securities-based loans, the initial credit evaluation typically includes, but is not limited to, review of the obligor's income, net worth, liquidity, collateral, ltv ratio and credit bureau information. subsequent credit monitoring for residential real estate loans is performed at the portfolio level. securities-based loan collateral values are monitored on an ongoing basis.
for information related to credit quality indicators considered in developing the acl, see note 2.

1.percent of loans to total loans represents loans held for investment by loan type to total loans held for investment.
the allowance for credit losses for loans and lending commitments increased in 2023, primarily related to deteriorating conditions in the commercial real estate sector, including provisions for certain specific loans, mainly in the office portfolio, and modest growth in certain other loan portfolios. charge-offs in 2023 were primarily related to commercial real estate and corporate loans. the base scenario used in our acl models as of december 31, 2023 was generated using a combination of consensus economic forecasts, forward rates, and internally developed and validated models, and assumes slow economic growth in 2024, followed by a gradual improvement in 2025. given the nature of our lending portfolio, the most sensitive model input is u.s. gdp.

certain senior debt securities are denominated in various non-u.s. dollar currencies and may be structured to provide a return that is linked to equity, credit, commodity or other indices (e.g., the consumer price index). senior debt also may be structured to be callable by the firm or extendible at the option of holders of the senior debt securities.
the firm's borrowings include notes carried and managed on a fair value basis. these include instruments whose payments and redemption values are linked to the performance of a specific index, a basket of stocks, a specific equity security, a commodity, a credit exposure or basket of credit exposures; and instruments with various interest rate-related features, including step-ups, step-downs and zero coupons. also included are unsecured contracts that are not classified as otc derivatives because they fail initial net investment criteria. to minimize the exposure from such instruments, the firm has entered into various swap contracts and purchased options that effectively convert the borrowing costs into floating rates. the swaps and purchased options used to economically hedge the embedded features are derivatives and also are carried at fair value. changes in fair value related to the notes and economic hedges are reported in trading

in general, other than securities inventories and customer balances financed by secured funding sources, the majority of the firm's assets are financed with a combination of deposits, short-term funding, floating rate long-term debt or fixed rate long-term debt swapped to a floating rate. the firm uses interest rate swaps to more closely match these borrowings to the duration, holding period and interest rate characteristics of the assets being funded and to manage interest rate risk. these swaps effectively convert certain of the firm's fixed rate borrowings into floating rate obligations. in addition, for non-u.s. dollar currency borrowings that are not used to fund assets in the same currency, the firm has entered into currency swaps that effectively convert the borrowings into u.s. dollar obligations.
the firm's use of swaps for asset and liability management affects its effective average borrowing rate.

since commitments associated with these instruments may expire unused, the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements.
types of commitments lending commitments.  lending commitments primarily represent the notional amount of legally binding obligations to provide funding to clients for different types of loan transactions. for syndications that are led by the firm, the lending commitments accepted by the borrower but not yet closed are net of the amounts agreed to by counterparties that will participate in the syndication. for syndications that the firm participates in and does not lead, lending commitments accepted by the borrower but not yet closed include only the amount that the firm expects it will be allocated from the lead syndicate bank. due to the nature of the firm's obligations under the commitments, these amounts include certain commitments participated to third parties.
forward-starting secured financing receivables.  this amount includes securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed that the firm has entered into prior to the balance sheet date that will settle after the balance sheet date. these transactions are primarily secured by collateral from u.s. government agency securities and other sovereign government obligations when they are funded.

1.the carrying amounts of derivative contracts that meet the accounting definition of a guarantee are shown on a gross basis. for further information on derivative contracts, see note 6.
2.these amounts include certain issued standby letters of credit participated to third parties, totaling $0.9 billion of notional and collateral/recourse, due to the nature of the firm's obligations under these arrangements. as of december 31, 2023, the carrying amount of standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees issued includes an allowance for credit losses of $70 million.
3.related to commercial and residential mortgage securitizations.
types of guarantees non-credit derivatives. certain derivative contracts meet the accounting definition of a guarantee, including certain written options, contingent-forward contracts and cds (see note 6 regarding credit derivatives in which the firm has sold credit protection to the counterparty which are excluded from the previous table). for non-credit derivative contracts that meet the accounting definition of a guarantee the notional amount is used as the maximum potential payout for certain derivative contracts, such as written interest rate caps and written foreign currency options. the firm evaluates collateral requirements for all derivatives, including derivatives that do not meet the december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements accounting definition of a guarantee. for the effects of cash collateral and counterparty netting, see note 6.
in certain situations, collateral may be held by the firm for those contracts that meet the definition of a guarantee. generally, the firm sets collateral requirements by counterparty so that the collateral covers various transactions and products and is not allocated specifically to individual contracts. also, the firm may recover amounts related to the underlying asset delivered to the firm under the derivative contract.
standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees issued. generally, in connection with its lending businesses, the firm provides standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees to counterparties. such arrangements represent obligations to make payments to third parties if the counterparty fails to fulfill its obligation under a borrowing arrangement or other contractual obligation. a majority of the firm's standby letters of credit are provided on behalf of counterparties that are investment grade. if the counterparty fails to fulfill its contractual obligation, the firm has access to collateral or recourse that would approximate its obligation.
market value guarantees. market value guarantees are issued to guarantee timely payment of a specified return to investors in certain affordable housing tax credit funds. these guarantees are designed to return an investor's contribution to a fund and the investor's share of tax losses and tax credits expected to be generated by a fund.
liquidity facilities. the firm has entered into liquidity facilities with spes and other counterparties, whereby the firm is required to make certain payments if losses or defaults occur. primarily, the firm acts as liquidity provider to municipal bond securitization spes and for stand-alone municipal bonds in which the holders of beneficial interests issued by these spes or the holders of the individual bonds, respectively, have the right to tender their interests for purchase by the firm on specified dates at a specified price. the firm often may have recourse to the underlying assets held by the spes in the event payments are required under such liquidity facilities, as well as make-whole or recourse provisions with the trust sponsors. the recourse amount often exceeds the maximum potential payout amount of the guarantee. substantially all of the underlying assets in the spes are investment grade. liquidity facilities provided to municipal tender option bond trusts are classified as derivatives.
whole loan sales guarantees. the firm has provided, or otherwise agreed to be responsible for, representations and warranties regarding certain whole loan sales. under certain circumstances, the firm may be required to repurchase such assets or make other payments related to such assets if such representations and warranties are breached. the firm's maximum potential payout related to such representations and warranties is equal to the current upb of such loans. since the firm no longer services these loans, it has no information on the current upb of those loans, and, accordingly, the amount included in the previous table represents the upb at the time of the whole loan sale or at the time when the firm last serviced any of those loans. the current upb balances could be substantially lower than the maximum potential payout amount included in the previous table. the related liability primarily relates to sales of loans to the federal mortgage agencies.
securitization representations and warranties. as part of the firm's institutional securities business segment's securitizations and related activities, the firm has provided, or otherwise agreed to be responsible for, representations and warranties regarding certain assets transferred in securitization transactions sponsored by the firm. the extent and nature of the representations and warranties, if any, vary among different securitizations. under certain circumstances, the firm may be required to repurchase certain assets or make other payments related to such assets if such representations and warranties are breached. the maximum potential amount of future payments the firm could be required to make would be equal to the current outstanding balances of, or losses associated with, the assets subject to breaches of such representations and warranties. the amount included in the previous table for the maximum potential payout includes the current upb or historical losses where known and the upb at the time of sale when the current upb is not known.
general partner guarantees. as a general partner in certain investment management funds, the firm receives certain distributions from the partnerships when the return exceeds specified performance targets according to the provisions of the partnership agreements. the firm may be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a certain return as specified in the various partnership agreements, subject to certain limitations.
client clearing guarantees. the firm is a sponsoring member of the government securities division of the ficc's sponsored clearing model. clients of the firm, as sponsored members, can transact in overnight and term securities repurchase and resale agreements, which are cleared through the ficc. as sponsoring member, the firm guarantees to the ficc the prompt and full payment and performance of its clients' obligations. in 2020, the ficc's sponsored clearing model was updated such that the firm could be responsible for liquidation of a sponsored member's account and guarantees any resulting loss to the ficc in the event the sponsored member fails to fully pay any net liquidation amount due from the sponsored member to the ficc. accordingly, the firm's maximum potential payout amount reflects the total of the estimated net liquidation amounts for sponsored member accounts. the firm minimizes credit exposure under this guarantee by obtaining a security interest in its sponsored member clients' collateral and their contractual rights under sponsored member transactions. therefore, the firm's exposure is estimated to be an amount substantially lower than the maximum potential payout december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements amount. the collateral amount in which the firm has a security interest is approximately equal to the maximum potential payout amount of the guarantee.
other guarantees and indemnities in the normal course of business, the firm provides guarantees and indemnifications in a variety of transactions. these provisions generally are standard contractual terms. certain of these guarantees and indemnifications are described below:
•indemnities. the firm provides standard indemnities to counterparties for certain contingent exposures and taxes, including u.s. and foreign withholding taxes, on interest and other payments made on derivatives, securities and stock lending transactions, certain annuity products and other financial arrangements. these indemnity payments could be required based on a change in the tax laws, a change in interpretation of applicable tax rulings or a change in factual circumstances. certain contracts contain provisions that enable the firm to terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of such events. the firm may also provide indemnities when it sells a business or assets to a third-party, pursuant to which it indemnifies the third-party for losses incurred on assets acquired or liabilities assumed or due to actions taken by the firm prior to the sale of the business or assets. the firm expects the risk of loss associated with indemnities related to the sale of businesses or assets to be remote. the maximum potential amount of future payments that the firm could be required to make under these indemnifications cannot be estimated.
•exchange/clearinghouse member guarantees. the firm is a member of various exchanges and clearinghouses that trade and clear securities and/or derivative contracts. associated with its membership, the firm may be required to pay a certain amount as determined by the exchange or the clearinghouse in case of a default of any of its members or pay a proportionate share of the financial obligations of another member that may default on its obligations to the exchange or the clearinghouse. while the rules governing different exchange or clearinghouse memberships and the forms of these guarantees may vary, in general the firm's obligations under these rules would arise only if the exchange or clearinghouse had previously exhausted its resources.
in addition, some clearinghouse rules require members to assume a proportionate share of losses resulting from the clearinghouse's investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin and of other losses unrelated to the default of a clearing member, if such losses exceed the specified resources allocated for such purpose by the clearinghouse.
the maximum potential payout under these rules cannot be estimated. the firm has not recorded any contingent liability in its financial statements for these agreements and believes that any potential requirement to make payments under these agreements is remote.
•merger and acquisition guarantees. the firm may, from time to time, in its role as investment banking advisor be required to provide guarantees in connection with certain european merger and acquisition transactions. if required by the regulating authorities, the firm provides a guarantee that the acquirer in the transaction has or will have sufficient funds to complete the transaction and would then be required to make the acquisition payments in the event the acquirer's funds are insufficient at the completion date of the transaction. these arrangements generally cover the time frame from the transaction offer date to its closing date and, therefore, are generally short term in nature. the firm believes the likelihood of any payment by the firm under these arrangements is remote given the level of its due diligence in its role as investment banking advisor.
in addition, in the ordinary course of business, the firm guarantees the debt and/or certain trading obligations (including obligations associated with derivatives, foreign exchange contracts and the settlement of physical commodities) of certain subsidiaries. these guarantees generally are entity or product specific and are required by investors or trading counterparties. the activities of the firm's subsidiaries covered by these guarantees (including any related debt or trading obligations) are included in the financial statements.
finance subsidiary the parent company fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by morgan stanley finance llc, a wholly owned finance subsidiary. no other subsidiary of the parent company guarantees these securities.
contingencies legal in addition to the matters described below, in the normal course of business, the firm has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution. certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. in some cases, the third-party entities that are, or would otherwise be, the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt, in financial distress, or may not honor applicable indemnification obligations. these actions have included, but are not limited to, antitrust claims, claims under various false claims act statutes, and matters arising from our sales and trading businesses and our activities in the capital markets.
the firm is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding the firm's business, and involving, among other matters, sales, trading, financing, prime brokerage, market-making activities, investment banking advisory services, capital markets activities, financial products or offerings sponsored, underwritten or sold by the firm, wealth and investment management services, and accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, disgorgement, restitution, forfeiture, injunctions, limitations on our ability to conduct certain business, or other relief.
the firm contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the firm can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss or the range of loss, the firm accrues an estimated loss by a charge to income, including with respect to certain of the individual proceedings or investigations described below.

legal expenses          $488          $443          $157
the firm's legal expenses can, and may in the future, fluctuate from period to period, given the current environment regarding government or self-regulatory agency investigations and private litigation affecting global financial services firms, including the firm.
in many legal proceedings and investigations, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or reasonably possible, or to estimate the amount of any loss. in addition, even where the firm has determined that a loss is probable or reasonably possible or an exposure to loss or range of loss exists in excess of the liability already accrued with respect to a previously recognized loss contingency, the firm is often unable to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss or range of loss. it is particularly difficult to determine if a loss is probable or reasonably possible, or to estimate the amount of loss, where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, forfeiture, disgorgement or penalties. numerous issues may need to be resolved in an investigation or proceeding before a determination can be made that a loss or additional loss (or range of loss or range of additional loss) is probable or reasonably possible, or to estimate the amount of loss, including through potentially lengthy discovery or determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification, the calculation of damages or other relief, and consideration of novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question.
the firm has identified below any individual proceedings or investigations where the firm believes a material loss (or where an accrual has occurred, a material loss beyond the amount already accrued) to be reasonably possible. in many legal proceedings in which the firm has determined that a material loss (or where an accrual has occurred, a material loss beyond the amount already accrued) is reasonably possible, the firm is unable to reasonably estimate the loss or range of loss. there are other matters in which the firm has determined a loss or range of loss to be reasonably possible, but the firm does not believe, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that such losses could have a material adverse effect on the firm's financial statements as a whole, although the outcome of such proceedings or investigations may significantly impact the firm's business or results of operations for any particular reporting period, or cause significant reputational harm.
while the firm has identified below certain proceedings or investigations that the firm believes to be material, individually or collectively, there can be no assurance that material losses will not be incurred from claims that have not yet been asserted or those where potential losses have not yet been determined to be probable or reasonably possible.
block trading matter on january 12, 2024, the u.s. attorney's office for the southern district of new york ("usao") and the sec announced they had reached settlement agreements with the firm in connection with their investigations into the firm's blocks business. specifically, the firm entered into a three-year non-prosecution agreement ("npa") with the usao that included the payment of forfeiture, restitution, and a criminal fine for making false statements in connection with the sale of certain block trades from 2018 through august 2021. the npa required the firm to admit responsibility for certain acts of its employees and to continue to cooperate with and provide certain information to the usao for the term of the agreement. additionally, the sec charged the firm with violations of section 10(b) of the exchange act and rule 10b-5(b) thereunder for the disclosure of confidential information about block trades and also violations of section 15(g) of the exchange act for the failure to enforce its policies concerning the misuse of material non-public information related to block trades. as part of the sec agreement, the firm paid disgorgement and a civil penalty. after the agreed-upon credits were applied, the firm paid a total amount of approximately $249 million under both settlements. the firm also faces potential civil liability arising from claims that have been or may be asserted by, among others, block transaction participants who contend they were harmed or disadvantaged including, among other things, as a result of a share price decline allegedly caused by the activities of the firm and/or its employees, or as a result of the firm's and/or its employees' failure to adhere to applicable laws and regulations. in addition, the firm has responded to demands from shareholders under section 220 of the delaware general corporation law for books and records concerning the investigations.

15. variable interest entities and securitization activities overview the firm is involved with various spes in the normal course of business. in most cases, these entities are deemed to be vies.
the firm's variable interests in vies include debt and equity interests, commitments, guarantees, derivative instruments and certain fees. the firm's involvement with vies arises primarily from:
•interests purchased in connection with market-making activities, securities held in its investment securities portfolio and retained interests held as a result of securitization activities, including re-securitization transactions.
•guarantees issued and residual interests retained in connection with municipal bond securitizations.
•loans made to and investments in vies that hold debt, equity, real estate or other assets.
•derivatives entered into with vies.
•structuring of clns or other asset-repackaging notes designed to meet the investment objectives of clients.
•other structured transactions designed to provide tax-efficient yields to the firm or its clients.
the firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a vie upon its initial involvement with the vie and reassesses whether it is the primary beneficiary on an ongoing basis as long as it has any continuing involvement with the vie. this determination is based upon an analysis of the design of the vie, including the vie's structure and activities, the power to make significant economic decisions held by the firm and by other parties, and the variable interests owned by the firm and other parties.
the power to make the most significant economic decisions may take a number of different forms in different types of vies. the firm considers servicing or collateral management decisions as representing the power to make the most significant economic decisions in transactions such as securitizations or cdos. as a result, the firm does not consolidate securitizations or cdos for which it does not act as the servicer or collateral manager unless it holds certain other rights to replace the servicer or collateral manager or to require the liquidation of the entity. if the firm serves as servicer or collateral manager, or has certain other rights described in the previous sentence, the firm analyzes the interests in the vie that it holds and consolidates only those vies for which it holds a potentially significant interest in the vie.
for many transactions, such as re-securitization transactions, clns and other asset-repackaging notes, there are no significant economic decisions made on an ongoing basis. in these cases, the firm focuses its analysis on decisions made prior to the initial closing of the transaction and at the termination of the transaction. the firm concluded in most of these transactions that decisions made prior to the initial closing were shared between the firm and the initial investors based upon the nature of the assets, including whether the assets were issued in a transaction sponsored by the firm and the extent of the information available to the firm and to investors, the number, nature and involvement of investors, other rights held by the firm and investors, the standardization of the legal documentation and the level of continuing involvement by the firm, including the amount and type of interests owned by the firm and by other investors. the firm focused its control decision on any right held by the firm or investors related to the termination of the vie. most re-securitization transactions, clns and other asset-repackaging notes have no such termination rights.

consolidated vie assets and liabilities are presented in the previous tables after intercompany eliminations. generally, most assets owned by consolidated vies cannot be removed unilaterally by the firm and are not available to the firm while the related liabilities issued by consolidated vies are non-recourse to the firm. however, in certain consolidated vies, the firm either has the unilateral right to remove assets or provides additional recourse through derivatives such as total return swaps, guarantees or other forms of involvement.
in general, the firm's exposure to loss in consolidated vies is limited to losses that would be absorbed on the vie net assets recognized in its financial statements, net of amounts absorbed by third-party variable interest holders.

securitization activities in a securitization transaction, the firm transfers assets (generally commercial or residential mortgage loans or securities) to an spe; sells to investors most of the beneficial interests, such as notes or certificates, issued by the spe; and, in many cases, retains other beneficial interests. the purchase of the transferred assets by the spe is financed through the sale of these interests.
in many securitization transactions involving commercial mortgage loans, the firm transfers a portion of the assets to the spe with unrelated parties transferring the remaining assets. in addition, mainly in securitization transactions involving residential mortgage loans, the firm may also enter into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps or interest rate caps, with the spe.
although not obligated, the firm generally makes a market in the securities issued by spes in securitization transactions. as a market maker, the firm offers to buy these securities from, and sell these securities to, investors. securities purchased through these market-making activities are not considered to be retained interests; these beneficial interests generally are included in trading assets-corporate and other debt and are measured at fair value.
the firm enters into derivatives, generally interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, with a senior payment priority in many securitization transactions. the risks associated with these and similar derivatives with spes are essentially the same as similar derivatives with non-spe counterparties and are managed as part of the firm's overall exposure. see note 6 for further information on derivative instruments and hedging activities.
investment securities the firm holds securities issued by vies within the investment securities portfolio. these securities are composed of those related to transactions sponsored by the federal mortgage agencies and predominantly the most senior securities issued by vies backed by student loans and commercial mortgage loans. transactions sponsored by the federal mortgage agencies include an explicit or implicit guarantee provided by the u.s. government. additionally, the firm holds certain commercial mortgage-backed securities issued by vies retained as a result of the firm's securitization activities. see note 7 for further information on the investment securities portfolio.
municipal tender option bond trusts in a municipal tender option bond trust transaction, the client transfers a municipal bond to a trust. the trust issues short-term securities that the firm, as the remarketing agent, sells to investors. the client generally retains a residual interest. the short-term securities are supported by a liquidity facility pursuant to which the investors may put their short-term interests. in most programs, a third-party provider will provide such liquidity facility; in some programs, the firm provides this liquidity facility.
the firm may, in lieu of purchasing short-term securities for remarketing, decide to extend a temporary loan to the trust. the client can generally terminate the transaction at any time. the liquidity provider can generally terminate the transaction upon the occurrence of certain events. when the transaction is terminated, the municipal bond is generally sold or returned to the client. any losses suffered by the liquidity provider upon the sale of the bond are the responsibility of the client. this obligation is generally collateralized. liquidity facilities provided to municipal tender option bond trusts are classified as derivatives. the firm consolidates any municipal tender option bond trusts in which it holds the residual interest.
credit protection purchased through credit-linked notes cln transactions are designed to provide investors with exposure to certain credit risk on referenced assets. in these transactions, the firm transfers assets (generally high-quality securities or money-market investments) to an spe, enters into a derivative transaction in which the spe sells protection on an unrelated referenced asset or group of assets, through a credit derivative, and sells the securities issued by the spe to investors. in some transactions, the firm may also enter into interest rate or currency swaps with the spe. depending on the structure, the assets and liabilities of the spe may be consolidated and recognized in the firm's balance sheet or accounted for as a sale of assets.
upon the occurrence of a credit event related to the referenced asset, the spe will deliver securities collateral as payment to the firm, which exposes the firm to changes in the collateral's value.
derivative payments by the spe are collateralized. the risks associated with these and similar derivatives with spes are essentially the same as those with non-spe counterparties and are managed as part of the firm's overall exposure.
december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements other structured financings the firm invests in interests issued by entities that develop and own low-income communities (including low-income housing projects) and entities that construct and own facilities that will generate energy from renewable resources. the interests entitle the firm to a share of tax credits and tax losses generated by these projects. in addition, the firm has issued guarantees to investors in certain low-income housing funds. the guarantees are designed to return an investor's contribution to a fund and the investor's share of tax losses and tax credits expected to be generated by the fund. the firm is also involved with entities designed to provide tax-efficient yields to the firm or its clients.
collateralized loan and debt obligations clos and cdos are spes that purchase a pool of assets consisting of corporate loans, corporate bonds, abs or synthetic exposures on similar assets through derivatives and issue multiple tranches of debt and equity securities to investors. the firm underwrites the securities issued in certain clo transactions on behalf of unaffiliated sponsors and provides advisory services to these unaffiliated sponsors. the firm sells corporate loans to many of these spes, in some cases representing a significant portion of the total assets purchased. although not obligated, the firm generally makes a market in the securities issued by spes in these transactions and may retain unsold securities. these beneficial interests are included in trading assets and are measured at fair value.
equity-linked notes eln transactions are designed to provide investors with exposure to certain risks related to the specific equity security, equity index or other index. in an eln transaction, the firm typically transfers to an spe either a note issued by the firm, the payments on which are linked to the performance of a specific equity security, equity index or other index, or debt securities issued by other companies and a derivative contract, the terms of which will relate to the performance of a specific equity security, equity index or other index. these eln transactions with spes were not consolidated at december 31, 2023 or december 31, 2022.

16. regulatory requirements regulatory capital framework the firm is an fhc under the bank holding company act of 1956, as amended, and is subject to the regulation and oversight of the board of governors of the federal reserve system ("federal reserve"). the federal reserve establishes capital requirements for the firm, including "well-capitalized" standards, and evaluates the firm's compliance with such capital requirements. the occ establishes similar capital requirements and standards for the firm's u.s. bank subsidiaries, including, among others, msbna and mspbna (together, "u.s. bank subsidiaries"). the regulatory capital requirements are largely based on the basel iii capital standards established by the basel committee on banking supervision and also implement certain provisions of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act. in addition, many of the firm's regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements, including regulated subsidiaries registered as swap dealers with the cftc or conditionally registered as security-based swap dealers with the sec or registered as broker-dealers or futures commission merchants.
regulatory capital requirements the firm is required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage-based capital ratios under regulatory capital requirements. a summary of the calculations of regulatory capital and rwa follows.
risk-based regulatory capital. risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital (which includes tier 2 capital), each as a percentage of rwa, and consist of regulatory minimum required ratios plus the firm's capital buffer requirement. capital requirements require certain adjustments to, and deductions from, capital for purposes of determining these ratios.
cecl deferral. beginning on january 1, 2020, the firm elected to defer the effect of the adoption of cecl on its risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios, as well as rwa, adjusted average assets and supplementary leverage exposure calculations, over a five-year transition period. the deferral impacts began to phase in at 25% per year from january 1, 2022 and are phased-in at 50% from january 1, 2023. the deferral impacts will become fully phased-in beginning on january 1, 2025.

the capital buffer requirement represents the amount of common equity tier 1 capital the firm must maintain above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid restrictions on the firm's ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. the firm's capital buffer requirement computed under the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market risk rwa ("standardized approach") is equal to the sum of the scb, g-sib capital surcharge and ccyb, and the capital buffer requirement computed under the applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk rwa ("advanced approach") is equal to the sum of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer, g-sib capital surcharge and ccyb.

1.required ratios represent the regulatory minimum plus the capital buffer requirement.
risk-weighted assets rwa reflects both the firm's on- and off-balance sheet risk, as well as capital charges attributable to the risk of loss arising from the following:
•credit risk: the failure of a borrower, counterparty or issuer to meet its financial obligations to the firm;
•market risk: adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity; and
•operational risk: inadequate or failed processes or systems from human factors or from external events (e.g., fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyberattacks or damage to physical assets).
the firm's risk-based capital ratios are computed under both (i) the standardized approach and (ii) the advanced approach. the credit risk rwa calculations between the two approaches differ in that the standardized approach requires calculation of rwa using prescribed risk weights, whereas the advanced approach utilizes models to calculate exposure amounts and risk weights. at december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, the differences between the actual and required ratio were lower under the standardized approach.
leverage-based regulatory capital. leverage-based capital requirements include a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%, a minimum slr of 3% and an enhanced slr capital buffer of at least 2%.

cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments include gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements from their respective functional currencies to u.s. dollars, net of hedge gains or losses and related tax effects. the firm uses foreign currency contracts to manage the currency exposure relating to its net investments in non-u.s. dollar functional currency subsidiaries and determines the amount of exposure to hedge on a pre-tax basis. the firm may also elect not to hedge its net investments in certain foreign operations due to market conditions or other reasons, including the availability of various currency contracts at acceptable costs. information relating to the effects on cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments that resulted from the translation of foreign currency financial statements and from gains and losses from hedges of the firm's net investments in non-u.s. dollar functional currency subsidiaries is summarized in the previous table.

1. fair value of converted stock is based on the share price at conversion. fair value of vested stock is based on the share price at date of vesting.
performance-based stock units psus vest and convert to shares of common stock only if the firm satisfies, over a three-year performance period, performance goals that are determined on the award date. the number of psus that may vest ranges from 0% to 150% of the target award, based on the firm's level of achievement of the specified performance goals. one-half of a psu award is earned based on the firm's average return on tangible common equity ("ms average rotce") over the performance period. the other half of a psu award is earned based on the firm's total shareholder return, relative to the total shareholder return of the s&p 500 financials sector index ("ms relative tsr") for awards granted prior to 2023, or for psu awards granted in 2023 based on the ms average rotce relative to the return on tangible common equity of each member of the defined comparison group ("ms relative rotce"). psus have vesting, conversion and cancellation provisions that are generally similar to those of rsus. at december 31, 2023, approximately 2.8 million psus at target were outstanding.

the discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation were selected by the firm, in consultation with its independent actuary. the u.s. pension plans use a pension discount yield curve based on the characteristics of the plans, each determined independently. the pension discount yield curve represents spot discount yields based on duration implicit in a representative broad-based aa-rated corporate bond universe of high-quality fixed income investments. for all non-u.s. pension plans, the assumed discount rates are based on the nature of liabilities, local economic environments and available bond indices.

the u.s. qualified plan assets represent 87% and 88% of the firm's total pension plan assets at december 31, 2023 and december 2022, respectively. the u.s. qualified plan uses a combination of active and risk-controlled fixed income investment strategies. the fixed income asset allocation consists primarily of fixed income securities and related derivative instruments designed to approximate the expected cash flows of the plan's liabilities to help reduce plan exposure to interest rate variation and to better align assets with the obligation. the longer-duration fixed income allocation is expected to help protect the plan's funded status and maintain the stability of plan contributions over the long run. the investment portfolio performance is assessed by comparing actual investment performance with changes in the estimated present value of the u.s. qualified plan's benefit obligation.
derivative instruments are permitted in the u.s. qualified plan's investment portfolio only to the extent that they comply with all of the plan's investment policy guidelines and are consistent with the plan's risk and return objectives.

notes to consolidated financial statements investment returns in the underlying assets and not to circumvent portfolio restrictions.
plan assets are measured at fair value using valuation techniques that are consistent with the valuation techniques applied to the firm's major categories of assets and liabilities as described in notes 2 and 4. otc derivative contracts consist of investments in interest rate swaps and total return swaps. other investments consist of insurance contracts held by non-u.s.-based plans. the insurance contracts are valued based on the premium reserve of the insurer for a guarantee that the insurer has given to the employee benefit plan that approximates fair value. the insurance contracts are categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
commingled trust funds are privately offered funds regulated, supervised and subject to periodic examination by a u.s. federal or state agency and available to institutional clients. the trust must be maintained for the collective investment or reinvestment of assets contributed to it from u.s. tax-qualified employee benefit plans maintained by more than one employer or controlled group of corporations. the sponsor of the commingled trust funds values the funds based on the fair value of the underlying securities. commingled trust funds are redeemable at nav at the measurement date or in the near future.
some non-u.s.-based plans hold foreign funds that consist of investments in fixed income funds and liquidity funds. fixed income funds are designed to provide a series of fixed annual cash flows achieved by investing in government and corporate bonds. liquidity funds place a high priority on capital preservation, stable value and a high liquidity of assets. foreign funds are readily redeemable at nav.
the firm generally considers the nav of commingled trust funds and foreign funds provided by the fund manager to be the best estimate of fair value.

controls and procedures conclusion regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of the firm's management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, the firm conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the firm's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in rule 13a-15(e) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act")). based on this evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the firm's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.
management's report on internal control over financial reporting the firm's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. the firm's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america ("u.s. gaap").
the internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
•pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the firm;
•provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the firm's management and directors; and
•provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of firm assets that could have a material effect on the firm's financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
management assessed the effectiveness of the firm's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2023. in making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission ("coso") in internal control-integrated framework (2013). based on management's assessment and those criteria, management believes that the firm maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2023.
the firm's independent registered public accounting firm has audited and issued a report on the firm's internal control over financial reporting, which appears below.
december 2023 form 10-k report of independent registered public accounting firm to the shareholders and the board of directors of morgan stanley:
opinion on internal control over financial reporting we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of morgan stanley and subsidiaries (the "firm") as of december 31, 2023, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso). in our opinion, the firm maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2023, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by coso.
we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the financial statements of the firm as of and for the year ended december 31, 2023 and our report dated february 22, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
basis for opinion the firm's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the firm's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the firm in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

other information on february 20, 2024 the compensation, management development and succession committee of the board of directors ("cmds committee") of morgan stanley approved amendments to each of the award certificates ("award certificates") covering all outstanding performance stock units granted under the morgan stanley equity incentive compensation plan, including to executive officers of the firm. under the original terms of the award certificates, upon termination of employment due to death or disability, the participant vests in a prorated portion of the shares earned by applying the performance multiplier based on service during the performance period. the cmds committee amended each award certificate to provide that, upon termination of employment due to death or disability, the participant vests in the full number of shares earned by applying the performance multiplier. providing for full vesting of performance stock units upon termination of employment due to death or disability is consistent with the provisions of morgan stanley's restricted stock units.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-liquidity and capital resources" herein.
legal, regulatory and compliance risk legal, regulatory and compliance risk includes the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, including fines, penalties, judgments, damages and/or settlements, limitations on our business, or loss to reputation that we may suffer as a result of failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards and codes of conduct applicable to our business activities. this risk also includes contractual and commercial risk, such as the risk that a counterparty's performance obligations will be unenforceable. it also includes compliance with aml, terrorist financing, and anti-corruption rules and regulations. we are generally subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct our business (see also "business-supervision and regulation" and "risk factors").
we have established procedures based on legal and regulatory requirements on a worldwide basis that are designed to facilitate compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and to require that our policies relating to business conduct, ethics and practices are followed globally. in addition, we have established procedures to mitigate the risk that a counterparty's performance obligations will be unenforceable, including consideration of counterparty legal authority and capacity, adequacy of legal documentation, the permissibility of a transaction under applicable law and whether applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws limit or alter contractual remedies. the heightened legal and regulatory focus on the financial services and banking industries globally presents a continuing business challenge for us.
climate risk climate change manifests as physical and transition risks. the physical risks of climate change include harm to people and property arising from acute climate-related events, such as floods, hurricanes, heatwaves, droughts and wildfires, and chronic, longer-term shifts in climate patterns, such as higher global average temperatures, rising sea levels and long-term droughts. the transition risk of climate change include policy, legal, technology and market changes. examples of these transition risks include changes in consumer behavior and business sentiment, related technologies, shareholder preferences and any additional regulatory and legislative requirements, including increased disclosure or carbon taxes.
climate risk, which is not expected to have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition in the near term, is an overarching risk that can impact other categories of risk. physical risk may lead to increased credit risk by diminishing borrowers' repayment capacity or impacting the value of collateral. in addition, physical risk could pose increased operational risk to our facilities and people. the impacts of transition risk may lead to and amplify credit, market or liquidity risk by reducing our customers' operating income or the value of their assets as well as exposing us to reputational, compliance and/or litigation risk due to increased legal and regulatory scrutiny or negative public sentiment.

opinion on the financial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of morgan stanley and subsidiaries (the "firm") as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated income statements, comprehensive income statements, cash flow statements and statements of changes in total equity for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). in our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the firm as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.
we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the firm's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2023, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission and our report dated february 22, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the firm's internal control over financial reporting.
basis for opinion these financial statements are the responsibility of the firm's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the firm's financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the firm in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
critical audit matter the critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
valuation of level 3 financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis and level 3 loans held for sale - refer to note 4 to the financial statements critical audit matter description the firm's trading and financing activities result in the firm carrying material financial instruments having limited price transparency. these financial instruments can span a broad array of product types and generally include derivatives, securities, loans, and borrowings. as described in note 4, these level 3 financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis approximate $9.3 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively, and the level 3 loans held for sale approximate $6.7 billion at december 31, 2023. unlike financial instruments whose inputs are readily observable and, therefore, more easily independently corroborated, the valuation of these financial instruments is inherently subjective and often involves the use of unobservable inputs and proprietary valuation models whose underlying algorithms and valuation methodologies are complex.
we identified the valuation of level 3 financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis and level 3 loans held for sale as a critical audit matter given the firm uses complex valuation models and/or valuation inputs that are not observable in the marketplace to determine the respective carrying values. performing our audit procedures to evaluate the appropriateness of these models and inputs involved a high degree of auditor judgment, professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, and an increased extent of testing.
how the critical audit matter was addressed in the audit our audit procedures related to the valuation of level 3 financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis and level 3 loans held for sale included the following, among others:
•we tested the design and operating effectiveness of the firm's model review and price verification controls. the firm maintains these internal controls to assess the appropriateness december 2023 form 10-k of its valuation methodologies and the relevant inputs and assumptions.
•we independently evaluated the appropriateness of management's valuation methodologies, for selected financial instruments, including the input assumptions, considering the expected assumptions of other market participants and external data when available.
•we developed independent estimates for selected financial instruments, using externally sourced inputs and independent valuation models, and used such estimates to further evaluate management's estimates. for certain of our selected financial instruments, this included a comparison to the firm's estimates for similar transactions and an evaluation of the firm's assumptions inclusive of the inputs, as applicable.
•we tested the revenues arising from the trade date fair value estimates for selected structured transactions for which we developed independent fair value estimates to test the valuation inputs and assumptions used by the firm and evaluated whether these methods were consistent with the firm's relevant valuation policies.
•we assessed the consistency by which management has applied significant and unobservable valuation assumptions used in developing the firm's estimates.
•we performed a retrospective assessment of management's fair value estimates for certain of our selected financial instruments, for which there were events or transactions occurring after the valuation date. we did so by comparing management's estimates to the relevant evidence provided by such events or transactions, as applicable.

a description of the clients and principal products and services of each of the firm's business segments is as follows:
institutional securities provides a variety of products and services to corporations, governments, financial institutions and ultra-high net worth clients. investment banking services consist of capital raising and financial advisory services, including the underwriting of debt, equity securities and other products, as well as advice on mergers and acquisitions, restructurings and project finance. our equity and fixed income businesses include sales, financing, prime brokerage, market-making, asia wealth management services and certain business-related investments. lending activities include originating corporate loans and commercial real estate loans, providing secured lending facilities, and extending securities-based and other financing to customers. other activities include research.
wealth management provides a comprehensive array of financial services and solutions to individual investors and small to medium-sized businesses and institutions covering: financial advisor-led brokerage, custody, administrative and investment advisory services; self-directed brokerage services; financial and wealth planning services; workplace services, including stock plan administration; securities-based lending, residential real estate loans and other lending products; banking; and retirement plan services.
investment management provides a broad range of investment strategies and products that span geographies, asset classes, and public and private markets to a diverse group of clients across institutional and intermediary channels. strategies and products, which are offered through a variety of investment vehicles, include equity, fixed income, alternatives and solutions, and liquidity and overlay services. institutional clients include defined benefit/defined contribution plans, foundations, endowments, government entities, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, third-party fund sponsors and corporations. individual clients are generally served through intermediaries, including affiliated and non-affiliated distributors.
basis of financial information the financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap, which requires the firm to make estimates and assumptions regarding the valuations of certain financial instruments, the valuations of goodwill and intangible assets, the outcome of legal and tax matters, deferred tax assets, acl, and other matters that affect its financial statements and related disclosures. the firm believes that the estimates utilized in the preparation of its financial statements are prudent and reasonable. actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
the notes are an integral part of the firm's financial statements. the firm has evaluated subsequent events for adjustment to or disclosure in these financial statements through the date of this report and has not identified any recordable or disclosable events not otherwise reported in these financial statements or the notes thereto.
consolidation the financial statements include the accounts of the firm, its wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities in which the firm has a controlling financial interest, including certain vies (see note 15). intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. for consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly owned, the third-party holdings of equity interests are referred to as noncontrolling interests. the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as net income applicable to noncontrolling interests in the income statement. the portion of shareholders' equity that is attributable to noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as noncontrolling interests, a component of total equity, in the balance sheet.
for entities where the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support and the equity holders bear the residual economic risks and returns of the entity and have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly affect its economic performance, the firm consolidates those entities it controls either through a majority voting interest or otherwise. for vies (i.e., entities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria), the firm consolidates those entities where it has the power to make the decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the vie and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie.
for investments in entities in which the firm does not have a controlling financial interest but has significant influence over operating and financial decisions, it applies the equity method of accounting with net gains and losses recorded within other december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements revenues (see note 11) unless the firm has elected to measure the investment at fair value, in which case net gains and losses are recorded within investments revenues (see note 5).
equity and partnership interests held by entities qualifying for accounting purposes as investment companies are carried at fair value.

2. significant accounting policies revenue recognition revenues are recognized when the promised goods or services are delivered to our customers in an amount that is based on the consideration the firm expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services when such amounts are not probable of significant reversal.
investment banking revenues from investment banking activities consist of revenues earned from underwriting, primarily equity and fixed income securities and loan syndications, and advisory fees, primarily for mergers, acquisitions and restructurings.
underwriting revenues are generally recognized on trade date if there is no uncertainty or contingency related to the amount to be paid. underwriting costs are deferred and recognized in the relevant non-interest expenses line items when the related underwriting revenues are recorded.
advisory fees are recognized as advice is provided to the client, based on the estimated progress of work and when revenues are not probable of a significant reversal. advisory costs are recognized as incurred in the relevant non-interest expenses line items, including those reimbursed.
commissions and fees commission and fee revenues generally result from transaction-based arrangements in which the client is charged a fee for the execution of transactions. such revenues primarily arise from transactions in equity securities; services related to sales and trading activities; and sales of mutual funds, alternative funds, futures, insurance products and options, as well as revenues from order flow payments for directing customer orders to broker-dealers, exchanges and market centers for execution. commission and fee revenues are recognized on trade date when the performance obligation is satisfied.
asset management revenues asset management, distribution and administration fees are generally based on related asset levels, such as the aum of a customer's account or the net asset value of a fund. these fees are generally recognized when services are performed and the value of the assets is known. management fees are reduced by estimated fee waivers and expense caps, if any, provided to the customer.
performance-based fees not in the form of carried interest are recorded when the annual performance target is met and the revenues are not probable of a significant reversal.
sales commissions paid by the firm in connection with the sale of certain classes of shares of its open-end mutual fund products are accounted for as deferred commission assets and amortized to other expenses over the expected life of the contract. the firm periodically tests deferred commission assets for recoverability based on cash flows expected to be received in future periods. other asset management and distribution costs are recognized as incurred in the relevant non-interest expenses line items.
investments revenues-carried interest the firm is entitled to receive performance-based fees in the form of carried interest when the return in certain funds exceeds specified performance targets. when the firm earns carried interest from funds as specified performance thresholds are met, that carried interest and any related general or limited partner interest are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and measured based on the firm's claim on the nav of the fund at the reporting date, taking into account the distribution terms applicable to the interest held. such items are reflected within investments revenues.
see note 22 for information regarding the net cumulative unrealized amount of performance-based fee revenues at risk of reversal. see note 14 for information regarding general partner guarantees, which include potential obligations to return performance fee distributions previously received.
other items revenues from certain commodities-related contracts are recognized in trading revenues when the firm has transferred control over the promised goods or services to the customer.
receivables from contracts with customers are recognized in customer and other receivables in the balance sheet when the december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements underlying performance obligations have been satisfied and the firm has the right per the contract to bill the customer. contract assets are recognized in other assets when the firm has satisfied its performance obligations but customer payment is conditional on something other than the passage of time. contract liabilities are recognized in other liabilities and accrued expenses when the firm has collected payment from a customer based on the terms of the contract but the underlying performance obligations are not yet satisfied.
for contracts with a term of less than one year, incremental costs to obtain the contract are expensed as incurred. revenues are not discounted when payment is expected within one year.
the firm generally presents, net within revenues, taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected by the firm from a customer.
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with banks. cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of three months or less from the acquisition date that are readily convertible to cash and are not held for trading purposes.
cash and cash equivalents also include restricted cash, such as cash segregated in compliance with federal or other regulations, including minimum reserve requirements set by the federal reserve bank and other central banks, and the firm's initial margin deposited with clearing organizations.
fair value of financial instruments instruments within trading assets and trading liabilities are measured at fair value, either as required or allowed by accounting guidance. these financial instruments primarily represent the firm's trading and investment positions and include both cash and derivative products. in addition, securities classified as available-for-sale ("afs") are measured at fair value.
gains and losses on instruments carried at fair value are reflected in trading revenues, investments revenues or investment banking revenues in the income statement, except for gains and losses related to afs securities (see "afs investment securities" section herein and note 7) and derivatives accounted for as hedges, as well as economic derivative hedges associated with certain held-for-sale and held-for-investment corporate loans and lending commitments (see "hedge accounting" and "other hedges" herein and note 6).
interest income and interest expense are recorded within the income statement depending on the nature of the instrument and related market conventions. when interest is included as a component of the instruments' fair value, interest is recorded within trading revenues or investments revenues. otherwise, it is recorded within interest income or interest expense. dividend income is recorded in trading revenues or investments revenues depending on the business activity.
the fair value of otc financial instruments, including derivative contracts related to financial instruments and commodities, is presented in the accompanying balance sheet on a net-by-counterparty basis, when appropriate. additionally, the firm nets the fair value of cash collateral paid or received against the fair value amounts recognized for net derivative positions executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting agreement.
fair value option the firm has elected to measure certain eligible instruments at fair value, including securities purchased under agreements to resell, loans and lending commitments, equity method investments and certain other assets, deposits, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, other secured financings and borrowings.
fair value measurement-definition and hierarchy fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the "exit price") in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure. therefore, even when market assumptions are not readily available, assumptions are set to reflect those that the firm believes market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. where the firm manages a group of financial assets, financial liabilities, and nonfinancial items accounted for as derivatives on the basis of its net exposure to either market risks or credit risk, the firm measures the fair value of that group of financial instruments consistently with how market participants would price the net risk exposure at the measurement date.
in determining fair value, the firm uses various valuation approaches and establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that requires the most observable inputs be used when available.
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability that were developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the firm. unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect assumptions the firm believes other market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability that are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. the fair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the observability of inputs as follows, with level 1 being the highest and level 3 being the lowest level:
december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements level 1.  valuations based on quoted prices in active markets that the firm has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities. valuation adjustments, block discounts and discounts for entity-specific and contractual restrictions that would not transfer to market participants are not applied to level 1 instruments. since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment.
level 2.  valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, significant market inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, or market-corroborated inputs.
level 3.  valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
the availability of observable inputs can vary from product to product and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of product, whether the product is new and not yet established in the marketplace, the liquidity of markets and other characteristics particular to the product. to the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the firm in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
the firm considers prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including during periods of market dislocation. in periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. this condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified from level 1 to level 2 or from level 2 to level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. in such cases, the total fair value amount is disclosed in the level appropriate for the lowest level input that is significant to the total fair value of the asset or liability.
valuation techniques many cash instruments and otc derivative contracts have bid and ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace. bid prices reflect the highest price that a party is willing to pay for an asset. ask prices represent the lowest price that a party is willing to accept for an asset. the firm carries positions at the point within the bid-ask range that meets its best estimate of fair value. for offsetting positions in the same financial instrument, the same price within the bid-ask spread is used to measure both the long and short positions.
fair value for many cash instruments and otc derivative contracts is derived using pricing models. pricing models take into account the contract terms, as well as multiple inputs, including, where applicable, commodity prices, equity prices, interest rate yield curves, credit curves, correlation, creditworthiness of the counterparty, creditworthiness of the firm, option volatility and currency rates.
where appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account for various factors such as liquidity risk (bid-ask adjustments), credit quality, model uncertainty, and concentration risk and funding in order to arrive at fair value. adjustments for liquidity risk adjust model-derived mid-market amounts of level 2 and level 3 financial instruments for the bid-mid or mid-ask spread required to properly reflect the exit price of a risk position. bid-mid and mid-ask spreads are marked to levels observed in trade activity, broker quotes or other external third-party data. where these spreads are unobservable for the particular position in question, spreads are derived from observable levels of similar positions.
the firm applies credit-related valuation adjustments to its borrowings for which the fair value option was elected and to otc derivatives. the firm considers the impact of changes in its own credit spreads based upon observations of the secondary bond market spreads when measuring the fair value for borrowings.
for otc derivatives, which are recognized in trading assets at fair value in the balance sheet, the impact of changes in both the firm's and the counterparty's credit rating is considered when measuring fair value. in determining the expected exposure, the firm simulates the distribution of the future exposure to a counterparty, then applies market-based default probabilities to the future exposure, leveraging external third-party cds spread data. where cds spread data are unavailable for a specific counterparty, bond market spreads, cds spread data based on the counterparty's credit rating or cds spread data that reference a comparable counterparty may be utilized. the firm also considers collateral held and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate its exposure to each counterparty.
adjustments for model uncertainty are taken for positions whose underlying models are reliant on significant inputs that are neither directly nor indirectly observable, hence requiring reliance on established theoretical concepts in their derivation. these adjustments are derived by making assessments of the possible degree of variability using statistical approaches and market-based information where possible.
the firm may apply concentration adjustments to certain of its otc derivative portfolios to reflect the additional cost of closing out a particularly large risk exposure. where possible, these adjustments are based on observable market information, but in many instances, significant judgment is required to estimate the costs of closing out concentrated risk exposures due to the lack of liquidity in the marketplace.
the firm applies an fva in the fair value measurements of otc uncollateralized or partially collateralized derivatives december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements and in collateralized derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not permit the reuse of the collateral received. in general, fva reflects a market funding risk premium inherent in the noted derivative instruments. the methodology for measuring fva leverages the firm's existing credit-related valuation adjustment calculation methodologies, which apply to both assets and liabilities.
see note 4 for a description of valuation techniques applied to the major categories of financial instruments measured at fair value.
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis certain of the firm's assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. the firm incurs losses or gains for any adjustments of these assets or liabilities to fair value.
for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, fair value is determined by using various valuation approaches. the same hierarchy for inputs as described above, which requires that observable inputs be used when available, is used in measuring fair value for these items.
for further information on financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis, see note 4.
offsetting of derivative instruments in connection with its derivative activities, the firm generally enters into master netting agreements and collateral agreements with its counterparties. these agreements provide the firm with the right, in the event of a default by the counterparty, to net a counterparty's rights and obligations under the agreement and to liquidate and set off cash collateral against any net amount owed by the counterparty. derivatives with enforceable master netting agreements are reported net of cash collateral received and posted.
however, in certain circumstances, the firm may not have such an agreement in place; the relevant insolvency regime may not support the enforceability of the master netting agreement or collateral agreement; or the firm may not have sought legal advice to support the enforceability of the agreement. in cases where the firm has not determined an agreement to be enforceable, the related amounts are not offset (see note 6).
the firm's policy is generally to receive cash and/or securities posted as collateral (with rights of rehypothecation) in connection with derivative transactions, irrespective of the enforceability determination regarding the master netting and collateral agreement. in certain cases, the firm may agree for such collateral to be posted by the counterparty to a third-party custodian under a control agreement that enables it to take control of such collateral in the event of a counterparty default. the enforceability of the master netting agreement is taken into account in the firm's risk management practices and application of counterparty credit limits.
for information related to offsetting of derivatives, see note 6.
hedge accounting the firm applies hedge accounting using various derivative financial instruments for the following types of hedges: hedges of changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities due to the risk being hedged (fair value hedges); hedges of variability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate assets due to contractually specified interest rates (cash flow hedges) and hedges of net investments in foreign operations whose functional currency is different from the reporting currency of the parent company (net investment hedges). these financial instruments are included within trading assets-derivative and other contracts or trading liabilities-derivative and other contracts in the balance sheet. for hedges where hedge accounting is being applied, the firm performs effectiveness testing and other procedures. the change in the fair value of the designated portion of the hedging instrument should be highly correlated, between 80 and 125 percent of the change in the fair value, cash flows, or carrying value (due to translation gains or losses) of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. the firm considers the impact of valuation adjustments related to counterparty credit spreads and its own credit spreads to determine whether they would cause the hedging relationship to be ineffective.
fair value hedges-interest rate risk the firm's designated fair value hedges consist of interest rate swaps designated as hedges of changes in the benchmark interest rate of certain fixed rate afs securities and senior borrowings. the firm also designates interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of changes in the benchmark interest rate of certain fixed rate deposits. the firm is permitted to hedge the full, or part of the contractual term of the hedged instrument. the firm uses regression analysis to perform an ongoing prospective and retrospective assessment of the effectiveness of these hedging relationships. for qualifying fair value hedges of benchmark interest rates, the change in the fair value of the derivative, offset by the change in the fair value attributable to the change in the benchmark interest rate risk of the hedged asset (liability), is recognized in earnings each period as a component of interest income (expense). for afs securities, the change in fair value of the hedged item due to changes other than the risk being hedged will continue to be reported in oci. when a derivative is de-designated as a hedge, any basis adjustment remaining on the hedged asset (liability) is amortized to interest income (expense) over the remaining life of the asset (liability) using the effective interest method.
december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements net investment hedges the firm uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage a portion of the currency exposure relating to its net investments in foreign operations. to the extent that the notional amounts of the hedging instruments equal the portion of the investments being hedged and the underlying exchange rate of the derivative hedging instrument is the same as the exchange rate between the functional currency of the investee and the intermediate parent entity's functional currency, it is considered to be perfectly effective. the gain or loss from revaluing hedges of net investments in foreign operations at the spot rate is reported within aoci. the forward points on the hedging instruments are excluded from hedge effectiveness testing and changes in the fair value of this excluded component are recorded currently in interest income.
cash flow hedges-interest rate risk the firm's designated cash flow hedges consist of interest rate derivatives designated as hedges of variability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate assets due to changes in the contractually specified interest rates. the firm uses regression analysis to perform an ongoing prospective and retrospective assessment of the effectiveness of these hedging relationships.
the objective of this strategy is to hedge the risk of changes in the hedged item's cash flows attributable to changes in the contractually specified interest rate. for qualifying cash flow hedges of contractually specified interest rates, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in oci and subsequently reclassified to earnings in the same periods when the hedged item affects earnings. if cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued, aoci is released into earnings immediately if the cash flow of the hedged item is probable of not occurring. otherwise the amount in aoci is released into earnings as the forecasted transaction affects earnings.
other hedges in addition to hedges that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting, the firm uses derivatives to economically hedge credit risk associated with certain held-for-sale and held-for-investment corporate loans and lending commitments, and the related gains and losses are reported within other revenues in the income statement.
for further information on derivative instruments and hedging activities, see note 6.
afs investment securities afs securities are reported at fair value in the balance sheet. interest income, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, is included in interest income in the income statement. unrealized gains are recorded in oci, and unrealized losses are recorded either in oci or in other revenues as described below.
afs securities in an unrealized loss position are first evaluated to determine whether there is an intent to sell or it is more likely than not the firm will be required to sell before recovery of the amortized cost basis. if so, the amortized cost basis is written down to the fair value of the security such that the entire unrealized loss is recognized in other revenues, and any previously established acl is written off.
for all other afs securities in an unrealized loss position, any portion of unrealized losses representing a credit loss is recognized in other revenues and as an increase to the acl for afs securities, with the remainder of unrealized losses recognized in oci. a credit loss exists if the firm does not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the security. when considering whether a credit loss exists, the firm considers relevant information, including:
•guarantees (implicit or explicit) by the u.s. government;
•the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis;
•adverse conditions specifically related to the security, its industry or geographic area;
•changes in the financial condition of the issuer of the security or, in the case of an asset-backed debt security, changes in the financial condition of the underlying loan obligors;
•the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future;
•failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments;
•the current rating and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency.
if a credit loss exists, the firm measures the credit loss as the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected (discounted at the implicit interest rate at acquisition of the security or discounted at the effective yield for securities that incorporate changes in prepayment assumptions) and the amortized cost basis of the security. changes in prepayment assumptions alone are not considered to result in a credit loss. when estimating the present value of expected cash flows, information utilized includes the remaining payment terms of the security, prepayment speeds, financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults and the value of any underlying collateral.
presentation of acl and provision for credit losses acl                                 provision for credit losses afs securities       contra investment securities        other revenue december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements nonaccrual & acl charge-offs on afs securities afs securities follow the same nonaccrual and charge-off guidance as discussed in "allowance for credit losses" herein.
htm securities htm securities are reported at amortized cost, net of any acl, in the balance sheet. refer to "allowance for credit losses" herein for guidance on the acl determination. interest income, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts on htm securities, is included in interest income in the income statement.
loans the firm accounts for loans based on the following categories: loans held for investment; loans held for sale; and loans at fair value.
nonaccrual and acl charge-offs on loans all loan categories described below follow the same nonaccrual and charge-off guidance as discussed in "allowance for credit losses" herein.
loans held for investment loans held for investment are reported at amortized cost, which consists of the outstanding principle balance adjusted for any charge-offs, the allowance for credit losses, any unamortized deferred fees or costs for originated loans, and any unamortized premiums or discounts for purchased loans.
interest income.  interest income on performing loans held for investment is accrued and recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of interest. purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are amortized into interest income over the life of the loan to produce a level rate of return.
lending commitments.  the firm records the liability and related expense for the credit exposure related to commitments to fund loans. the liability is recorded in other liabilities in the balance sheet and the expense is recorded in the provision for credit losses in the income statement. for more information regarding loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, see note 14.
for more information regarding allowance for credit losses, refer to "allowance for credit losses" herein.
loans held for sale loans held for sale are measured at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in other revenues. the firm determines the valuation allowance on an individual loan basis, except for residential mortgage loans for which the valuation allowance is determined at the loan product level. any decreases in fair value below the initial carrying amount and any recoveries in fair value up to the initial carrying amount are recorded in other revenues. increases in fair value above initial carrying value are not recognized.
interest income. interest income on loans held for sale is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiums are deferred as an adjustment to the loan's cost basis until the related loan is sold and, as such, are included in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale.
lending commitments. commitments to fund mortgage loans held for sale are derivatives and are reported in trading assets or trading liabilities in the balance sheet and in trading revenues in the income statement.
for commitments to fund non-mortgage loans, the firm records the liability and related expense for the fair value exposure below cost of such commitments in other liabilities and accrued expenses in the balance sheet with an offset to other revenues in the income statement.
because loans and lending commitments held for sale are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the allowance for credit losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans.
loans at fair value loans for which the fair value option is elected are carried at fair value and included in trading assets in the balance sheet, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets, see note 4.
lending commitments. the firm records the liability and related expense for the fair value exposure related to commitments to fund loans that will be measured at fair value. the liability is recorded in trading liabilities in the balance sheet, and the expense is recorded in trading revenues in the income statement.
because such loans and lending commitments are reported at fair value, the allowance for credit losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans.
for further information on loans, see note 9. for more information regarding loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees, see note 14.
allowance for credit losses the acl for financial instruments measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet exposures (e.g., hfi loans and lending commitments, htm securities, customer and other receivables and certain guarantees) represents an december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements estimate of expected credit losses over the entire life of the financial instrument.
factors considered by management when determining the acl include payment status, fair value of collateral and expected payments of principal and interest, as well as internal or external information relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. the firm uses three forecasts that include assumptions about certain macroeconomic variables, including, but not limited to, u.s. gross domestic product ("gdp"), equity market indices and unemployment rates, as well as commercial real estate and home price indices. at the conclusion of the firm's reasonable and supportable forecast period of 13 quarters, there is a gradual reversion back to historical averages.
the acl is measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist for multiple instruments, considering all available information relevant to assessing the collectability of cash flows. generally, the firm applies a probability of default/loss given default model for instruments that are collectively assessed, under which the acl is calculated as the product of probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. these parameters are forecast for each collective group of assets using a scenario-based statistical model.
if the instrument does not share similar risk characteristics with other instruments, including when it is probable that the firm will be unable to collect the full payment of principal and interest on the instrument when due, the acl is measured on an individual basis. the firm generally applies a discounted cash flow method for instruments that are individually assessed.
the firm may also elect to use an approach that considers the fair value of the collateral when measuring the acl if the loan is collateral dependent (i.e., repayment of the loan is expected to be provided substantially by the sale or operation of the underlying collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty).
additionally, the firm can elect to use an approach to measure the acl that considers the fair value of collateral where the borrower is required to, and reasonably expected to, continually adjust and replenish the amount of collateral securing the instrument to reflect changes in the fair value of such collateral. the firm has elected to use this approach for certain securities-based loans, margin loans, securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed.
credit quality indicators considered in developing the acl include:
•corporate loans, secured lending facilities, commercial real estate loans and securities, and other loans: internal risk ratings developed by the crm that are refreshed at least annually, and more frequently as necessary. these ratings generally correspond to external ratings published by s&p. the firm also considers transaction structure, including type of collateral, collateral terms and position of the obligation within the capital structure. in addition, for commercial real estate, the firm considers property type and location, net operating income and ltv ratios, among other factors, as well as commercial real estate price and credit spread indices and capitalization rates.
•residential real estate loans: loan origination fair isaac corporation ("fico") credit scores as determined by independent credit agencies in the u.s. and ltv ratios.
•employee loans: employment status, which includes those currently employed by the firm and for which the firm can deduct any unpaid amounts due to it through certain compensation arrangements; and those no longer employed by the firm where such arrangements are no longer applicable.
qualitative and environmental factors such as economic and business conditions, the nature and volume of the portfolio, and lending terms and the volume and severity of past due loans are also considered in the acl calculations.
presentation of acl and provision for credit losses acl                                          provision for credit losses held for investment loans                                                                                      contra asset                                 provision for credit losses other instruments measured at amortized cost (e.g., htm securities and customer and other receivables)         contra asset                                 other revenues employee loans                                                                                                 contra asset                                 compensation and benefits expenses held for investment lending commitments                                                                        other liabilities and accrued expenses       provision for credit losses other off-balance sheet instruments (e.g., certain guarantees)                                                 other liabilities and accrued expenses       other expenses nonaccrual the firm places financial instruments on nonaccrual status if principal or interest is not expected when contractually due or is past due for a period of 90 days or more unless the obligation is well-secured and is in the process of collection.
for any instrument placed on nonaccrual status, the firm reverses any unpaid interest accrued with an offsetting reduction to interest income. principal and interest payments received on nonaccrual instruments are applied to principal if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal. if collection of the principal is not in doubt, interest income is realized on a cash basis. if the instrument is brought current and neither principal nor interest collection is in doubt, instruments can generally return to accrual status, and interest income can be recognized.
acl charge-offs the principal balance of a financial instrument is charged off in the period it is deemed uncollectible, resulting in a reduction in the acl and in the balance of the financial instrument in the balance sheet. accrued interest receivable december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements balances that are separately recorded from the related financial instruments are charged off against interest income when the related financial instrument is placed on nonaccrual status. accordingly, the firm elected not to measure an acl for accrued interest receivables.
transfers of financial assets transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when the firm has relinquished control over the transferred assets. any related gain or loss on sale is recorded in net revenues. transfers that are not accounted for as sales are treated as collateralized financings. securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized financings (see note 8).
securities purchased under agreements to resell ("reverse repurchase agreements") and securities sold under agreements to repurchase ("repurchase agreements"), including repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements-to-maturity, are carried in the balance sheet at the amount of cash paid or received plus accrued interest except for certain reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements for which the firm has elected the fair value option (see note 5). where appropriate, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis. securities borrowed and securities loaned are recorded at the amount of cash collateral advanced or received.
in instances where the firm is the lender in securities-for-securities transactions and is permitted to sell or repledge these securities, the fair value of the collateral received is reported in trading assets, and the related obligation to return the collateral is reported in trading liabilities in the balance sheet. securities-for-securities transactions where the firm is the borrower are not included in the balance sheet.
in order to manage credit exposure arising from these transactions, in appropriate circumstances, the firm enters into master netting agreements and collateral agreements with its counterparties. these agreements provide the firm with the right, in the event of a default by the counterparty, to net a counterparty's rights and obligations under the agreement and to liquidate and set off collateral held by the firm against the net amount owed by the counterparty.
the firm's policy is generally to take possession of securities purchased or borrowed in connection with reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions, respectively, and to receive cash and/or securities delivered under repurchase agreements or securities loaned transactions (with rights of rehypothecation).
for information related to offsetting of certain collateralized transactions, see note 8.
premises, equipment and capitalized software costs premises, equipment and capitalized software costs consist of buildings, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures, computer and communications equipment, power generation assets and capitalized software (externally purchased and developed for internal use). premises, equipment and capitalized software costs are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization and are included in other assets in the balance sheet. depreciation and amortization are provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset.

capitalized software costs                                       2 to 10
premises, equipment and capitalized software costs are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset's carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
goodwill and intangible assets the firm tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. the firm tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below the asset's business segment. the firm tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the aggregate level of management contracts. for both the annual and interim tests, the firm has the option to either (i) perform a quantitative impairment test or (ii) first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, in which case, the quantitative test would be performed.
when performing a quantitative impairment test, the firm compares the fair value with the carrying amount. if the fair value is less than the carrying amount, the impairment loss is equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, limited to the carrying amount.
the estimated fair values are derived based on valuation techniques the firm believes market participants would use. the estimated fair values are generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology or methodologies that incorporate price-to-book and price-to-earnings multiples of certain comparable companies for goodwill impairment testing.
december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements intangible assets with a finite life are amortized over their estimated useful life and are reviewed for impairment on an interim basis when impairment indicators are present. impairment losses are recorded within other expenses in the income statement.
earnings per common share basic eps is computed by dividing earnings available to morgan stanley common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. earnings available to morgan stanley common shareholders represents net income applicable to morgan stanley reduced by preferred stock dividends. common shares outstanding include common stock and vested rsus where recipients have satisfied the relevant vesting terms. diluted eps reflects the assumed conversion of all dilutive securities.
share-based awards that pay dividend equivalents subject to vesting are included in diluted shares outstanding (if dilutive) under the treasury stock method.
the firm has granted psus that vest and convert to shares of common stock only if predetermined performance and market goals are satisfied. since the issuance of the shares is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, the psus are included in diluted eps based on the number of shares (if any) that would be issuable if the reporting date was the end of the performance period.
for further information on diluted earnings (loss) per common share, see note 17 to the financial statements.
deferred compensation stock-based compensation the firm measures compensation expense for stock-based awards at fair value. the firm determines the fair value of rsus (including psus with non-market performance conditions) based on the grant-date fair value of its common stock, measured as the volume-weighted average price on the date of grant ("vwap"). the fair value of rsus not entitled to dividends until conversion is measured at vwap reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares prior to scheduled conversion date. psus that contain market-based conditions are valued using a monte carlo valuation model.
compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period relevant to each separately vesting portion of the award. compensation expense for awards with performance conditions is recognized based on the probable outcome of the performance condition at each reporting date. compensation expense for awards with market-based conditions is recognized irrespective of the probability of the market condition being achieved and is not reversed if the market condition is not met. the firm accounts for forfeitures as they occur.
stock-based awards generally contain clawback and cancellation provisions. certain awards provide the firm discretion to claw back or cancel all or a portion of the award under specified circumstances. where award terms are considered to be subjective, a grant date cannot be established and the awards are subject to variable accounting which requires that compensation expense for those awards is adjusted for changes in the fair value of the firm's common stock or the relevant model valuation, as appropriate, until conversion, exercise or expiration. following amendments to clarify specific subjective award terms in the second quarter of 2023, a grant date for the awards was established such that compensation expense for those awards is no longer adjusted for changes in the fair value of the firm's common stock. the firm also operates an employee stock purchase plan ("espp") which allows eligible employees of the firm to purchase shares of morgan stanley at a discount.
employee stock trusts in connection with certain stock-based compensation plans, the firm has established employee stock trusts to provide, at its discretion, common stock voting rights to certain rsu holders. following the grant of an rsu award, when a stock trust is utilized, the firm contributes shares to be held in the stock trust until the rsus convert to common shares. the assets of the employee stock trusts are consolidated with those of the firm and are generally accounted for in a manner similar to treasury stock, where the shares of common stock outstanding reported in common stock issued to employee stock trusts are offset by an equal amount reported in employee stock trusts in the balance sheet.
the firm uses the grant-date fair value of stock-based compensation as the basis for recording the movement of the assets to or from the employee stock trusts. changes in the fair value are not recognized as the firm's stock-based compensation must be settled by delivery of a fixed number of shares of the firm's common stock.
deferred cash-based compensation compensation expense for dcp awards is calculated based on the notional value of the award granted, adjusted for changes in the fair value of the referenced investments that employees select. compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period relevant to each separately vesting portion of deferred awards.
the firm invests directly, as a principal, in financial instruments and other investments to economically hedge certain of its obligations under its dcp. changes in the value of such investments are recorded in trading revenues and investments revenues. although changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments made by the firm, there is typically a timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on the firm's investments and december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period.
retirement-eligible employee compensation for year-end stock-based awards and dcp awards anticipated to be granted to retirement-eligible employees under award terms that do not contain a future service requirement, the firm accrues the estimated cost of the awards over the course of the calendar year preceding the grant date, which reflects the period over which the compensation is earned.
carried interest compensation the firm generally recognizes compensation expense for any portion of carried interest (both realized and unrealized) that is allocated to employees. for information on performance-based fees in the form of carried interest, which are directly related to carried interest compensation, see "revenue recognition-carried interest" herein.
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based upon the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income tax expense (benefit) in the period that includes the enactment date. such effects are recorded in provision for income taxes regardless of where deferred taxes were originally recorded.
the firm recognizes net deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. in making such a determination, the firm considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and results of recent operations. when performing the assessment, the firm considers all types of deferred tax assets in combination with each other, regardless of the origin of the underlying temporary difference. if a deferred tax asset is determined to be unrealizable, a valuation allowance is established. if the firm subsequently determines that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount, it would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.
the firm recognizes tax expense associated with global intangible low-taxed income as it is incurred as part of the current income taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period.
uncertain tax positions are recorded on the basis of a two-step process, whereby (i) the firm determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (ii) for those tax positions that meet this threshold, the firm recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes.
foreign currencies assets and liabilities of operations with non-u.s. dollar functional currencies are translated at year-end rates of exchange. gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements, net of hedge gains or losses and related tax effects, are reflected in aoci in the balance sheet. gains or losses resulting from remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are included in net income, and amounts recognized in the income statement are translated at the rate of exchange on the respective date of recognition for each amount.
accounting updates adopted in 2023
fair value measurement - equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions the firm early adopted the fair value measurement of equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions accounting update on july 1, 2023, with no material impact on the firm's financial condition or results of operations upon adoption. the update clarifies that a contractual sale restriction is not considered part of the unit of account of an equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value.
financial instruments - credit losses the firm adopted the financial instruments-credit losses accounting update on january 1, 2023, with no impact on the firm's financial condition or results of operations upon adoption.
this accounting update eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings ("tdrs") and requires new disclosures regarding certain modifications of financing receivables (i.e., principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant payment delays and term extensions) to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. the update also requires disclosure of current period gross charge-offs by year of origination for financing receivables measured at amortized cost. refer to note 9, loans, lending commitments and related allowance for credit losses, for the new disclosures.
accounting update adopted in 2022
reference rate reform the firm has adopted the reference rate reform accounting update, which extends the period of time entities can utilize the reference rate reform relief guidance from december 31, 2022 to december 31, 2024. the relief provides optional december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference libor or other interest rate benchmarks for which the referenced rate is expected to be discontinued or replaced. the firm is applying the accounting relief as relevant contract and hedge accounting relationship modifications are made during the course of the reference rate reform transition period. there was no impact to the firm's financial statements upon issuance of this accounting standard update.

valuation techniques for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis u.s. treasury and agency securities u.s. treasury securities valuation technique:
•fair value is determined using quoted market prices.
valuation hierarchy classification:
•level 1-as inputs are observable and in an active market u.s. agency securities valuation techniques:
•non-callable agency-issued debt securities are generally valued using quoted market prices, and callable agency-issued debt securities are valued by benchmarking model-derived prices to quoted market prices and trade data for comparable instruments.
•the fair value of agency mortgage pass-through pool securities is model-driven based on spreads of comparable to-be-announced securities.
•cmos are generally valued using quoted market prices and trade data adjusted by subsequent changes in related indices for comparable instruments.
valuation hierarchy classification:
•level 1-on-the-run agency issued debt securities if actively traded and inputs are observable
•level 2-all other agency issued debt securities, agency mortgage pass-through pool securities and cmos if actively traded and inputs are observable
•level 3-in instances where the trading activity is limited or inputs are unobservable other sovereign government obligations valuation techniques:
•fair value is determined using quoted prices in active markets when available. when not available, quoted prices in less active markets are used. in the absence of position-specific quoted prices, fair value may be determined through benchmarking from comparable instruments.
valuation hierarchy classification:
•level 1-if actively traded and inputs are observable
•level 2-if the market is less active or prices are dispersed
•level 3-in instances where the prices are unobservable state and municipal securities valuation techniques:
•fair value is determined using recently executed transactions, market price quotations or pricing models that factor in, where applicable, interest rates, bond or cds spreads, adjusted for any basis difference between cash and derivative instruments.
valuation hierarchy classification:
•level 2-if value based on observable market data supported by market liquidity for comparable instruments
•level 3-in instances where market data are not observable or supported by market liquidity december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements mortgage- and asset-backed securities valuation techniques:
•mortgage- and asset-backed securities may be valued based on price or spread data obtained from observed transactions or independent external parties such as vendors or brokers.
•when position-specific external price data are not observable, the fair value determination may require benchmarking to comparable instruments, and/or analyzing expected credit losses, default and recovery rates, and/or applying discounted cash flow techniques. when evaluating the comparable instruments for use in the valuation of each security, security collateral-specific attributes, including payment priority, credit enhancement levels, type of collateral, delinquency rates and loss severity, are considered. in addition, for rmbs borrowers, fico scores and the level of documentation for the loan are considered.
•market standard cash flow models may be utilized to model the specific collateral composition and cash flow structure of each transaction. key inputs to these models are market spreads, forecasted credit losses, and default and prepayment rates for each asset category.
•valuation levels of rmbs and cmbs indices are used as an additional data point for benchmarking purposes or to price outright index positions.
valuation hierarchy classification:
•level 2-if value based on observable market data supported by market liquidity for comparable instruments
•level 3-if external prices or significant spread inputs are unobservable or not supported by market liquidity or if the comparability assessment involves significant subjectivity related to property type differences, cash flows, performance or other inputs loans and lending commitments valuation techniques:
•fair value of corporate loans is determined using recently executed transactions, market price quotations (where observable), implied yields from comparable debt, market observable cds spread levels obtained from independent external parties adjusted for any basis difference between cash and derivative instruments, along with proprietary valuation models and default recovery analysis where such transactions and quotations are unobservable.
•fair value of contingent corporate lending commitments is determined by using executed transactions on comparable loans and the anticipated market price based on pricing indications from syndicate banks and customers. the valuation of loans and lending commitments also takes into account fee income that is considered an attribute of the contract.
•fair value of mortgage loans is determined using observable prices based on transactional data or third-party pricing for comparable instruments, when available.
•where position-specific external prices are not observable, fair value is estimated based on benchmarking to prices and rates observed in the primary market for similar loan or borrower types or based on the present value of expected future cash flows using the firm's best available estimates of the key assumptions, including forecasted credit losses, prepayment rates, forward yield curves and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved or a methodology that utilizes the capital structure and credit spreads of recent comparable securitization transactions.
•fair value of equity margin loans is determined by discounting future interest cash flows, net of potential losses resulting from large downward price movements of the underlying margin loan collateral. the potential losses are modeled using the margin loan rate, which is calibrated from market observable cds spreads, implied debt yields or volatility metrics of the loan collateral.
valuation hierarchy classification:
•level 2-if value based on observable market data supported by market liquidity for comparable instruments
•level 3-in instances where prices or significant spread inputs are unobservable or not supported by market liquidity or if the comparability assessment involves significant subjectivity corporate and other debt corporate bonds valuation techniques:
•fair value is determined using recently executed transactions, market price quotations, bond spreads and cds spreads obtained from independent external parties, such as vendors and brokers, adjusted for any basis difference between cash and derivative instruments.
•the spread data used are for the same maturity as the bond. if the spread data do not reference the issuer, then data that reference comparable issuers are used. when position-specific external price data are not observable, fair value is determined based on either benchmarking to comparable instruments or cash flow models with yield curves, bond or single-name cds spreads and recovery rates or loss given default as significant inputs.
valuation hierarchy classification:
•level 2-if value based on observable market data for comparable instruments
•level 3-in instances where prices or significant spread inputs are unobservable or if the comparability assessment involves significant subjectivity cdos valuation techniques:
•the firm holds cash cdos that typically reference a tranche of an underlying synthetic portfolio of single-name cds spreads collateralized by corporate bonds ("cln") or cash portfolio of abs/loans ("asset-backed cdos").
•credit correlation, a primary input used to determine the fair value of clns, is usually unobservable and derived using a benchmarking technique. other model inputs, such as credit spreads, including collateral spreads and interest rates, are typically observable.
•asset-backed cdos are valued based on an evaluation of the market and model input parameters sourced from comparable instruments as indicated by market activity.
december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements each asset-backed cdo position is evaluated independently taking into consideration available comparable market levels, underlying collateral performance and pricing, deal structures and liquidity.
valuation hierarchy classification:
•level 2-when either comparable market transactions are observable or credit correlation input is insignificant
•level 3-when either comparable market transactions are unobservable or the credit correlation input is significant equity contracts with financing features valuation techniques:
•fair value of certain equity contracts, which are not classified as otc derivatives because they do not meet the net investment criteria, is determined by discounting future interest cash flows, inclusive of the estimated value of the embedded optionality. the valuation uses the same derivative pricing models and valuation techniques as described under "otc derivative contracts" herein.

•exchange-traded equity securities are generally valued based on quoted prices from the exchange.
•unlisted equity securities are generally valued based on an assessment of each security, considering rounds of financing and third-party transactions, discounted cash flow analyses and market-based information, including comparable transactions, trading multiples and changes in market outlook, among other factors.

•level 2-when not actively traded otc derivative contracts valuation techniques:
•otc derivative contracts include forward, swap and option contracts related to interest rates, foreign currencies, credit standing of reference entities, equity prices or commodity prices.
•depending on the product and the terms of the transaction, the fair value of otc derivative products can be modeled using a series of techniques, including closed-form analytic formulas, such as the black-scholes option-pricing model, simulation models or a combination thereof. many pricing models do not entail material subjectivity as the methodologies employed do not necessitate significant judgment since model inputs may be observed from actively quoted markets, as is the case for generic interest rate swaps, many equity, commodity and foreign currency option contracts, and certain cds. in the case of more established derivative products, the pricing models used by the firm are widely accepted by the financial services industry.
•more complex otc derivative products are typically less liquid and require more judgment in the implementation of the valuation technique since direct trading activity or quotes are unobservable. this includes certain types of interest rate derivatives with both volatility and correlation exposure, equity, commodity or foreign currency derivatives that are either longer-dated or include exposure to multiple underlyings, and credit derivatives, including cds on certain mortgage- or asset-backed securities and basket cds. where required inputs are unobservable, relationships to observable data points, based on historical and/or implied observations, may be employed as a technique to estimate the model input values. for further information on the valuation techniques for otc derivative products, see note 2.

•investments include direct investments in equity securities, as well as various investment management funds, which include dcp investments.
•exchange-traded direct equity investments are generally valued based on quoted prices from the exchange.
•for direct investments, initially, the transaction price is generally considered by the firm as the exit price and is its best estimate of fair value.

1.net transfers in 2021 reflect the transfer in the third quarter of $895 million of equity margin loans from level 3 to level 2 as a result of the reduced significance of the margin loan rate input.
2.net transfers in 2021 reflect the transfer in the second quarter of $2.0 billion of corporate and other debt, $1.0 billion of net equity derivatives and $2.2 billion of borrowings from level 3 to level 2 as the unobservable inputs were not significant to the overall fair value measurements.
3.net transfers in 2021 reflect the transfer in the first quarter of $2.5 billion of afs securities from level 3 to level 2 due to increased trading activity and observability of pricing inputs.
level 3 instruments may be hedged with instruments classified in level 1 and level 2. the realized and unrealized gains or losses for assets and liabilities within the level 3 category presented in the previous tables do not reflect the related realized and unrealized gains or losses on hedging instruments that have been classified by the firm within the level 1 and/or level 2 categories.
the unrealized gains (losses) during the period for assets and liabilities within the level 3 category may include changes in fair value during the period that were attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs. total realized and unrealized gains (losses) are primarily included in trading revenues in the income statement.
additionally, in the previous tables, consolidations of vies are included in purchases, and deconsolidations of vies are included in settlements.

1.a single amount is disclosed for range and average when there is no significant difference between the minimum, maximum and average. amounts represent weighted averages except where simple averages and the median of the inputs are more relevant.
2.includes derivative contracts with multiple risks (i.e., hybrid products).
the previous table provides information on the valuation techniques, significant unobservable inputs, and the ranges and averages for each major category of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis with a significant level 3 balance. the level of aggregation and breadth of products cause the range of inputs to be wide and not evenly distributed across the inventory of financial instruments. further, the range of unobservable inputs may differ across firms in the financial services industry because of diversity in the types of products included in each firm's inventory. generally, there are no predictable relationships between multiple significant unobservable inputs attributable to a given valuation technique.
december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements during 2023, there were no significant revisions made to the descriptions of the firm's significant unobservable inputs.
an increase (decrease) to the following significant unobservable inputs would generally result in a higher (lower) fair value.
•comparable bond or loan price. a pricing input used when prices for the identical instrument are not available. significant subjectivity may be involved when fair value is determined using pricing data available for comparable instruments. valuation using comparable instruments can be done by calculating an implied yield (or spread over a liquid benchmark) from the price of a comparable bond or loan, then adjusting that yield (or spread) to derive a value for the bond or loan. the adjustment to yield (or spread) should account for relevant differences in the bonds or loans, such as maturity or credit quality. alternatively, a price-to-price basis can be assumed between the comparable instrument and the bond or loan being valued in order to establish the value of the bond or loan.
•comparable equity price. a price derived from equity raises, share buybacks and external bid levels, etc. a discount or premium may be included in the fair value estimate.
•contingency probability. probability associated with the realization of an underlying event upon which the value of an asset is contingent.
•ebitda multiple/exit multiple. the ratio of enterprise value to ebitda, where enterprise value is the aggregate value of equity and debt minus cash and cash equivalents. the ebitda multiple reflects the value of a company in terms of its full-year ebitda, whereas the exit multiple reflects the value of a company in terms of its full-year expected ebitda at exit. either multiple allows comparison between companies from an operational perspective as the effect of capital structure, taxation and depreciation/amortization is excluded.
an increase (decrease) to the following significant unobservable inputs would generally result in a lower (higher) fair value.
•cash-synthetic basis. the measure of the price differential between cash financial instruments and their synthetic derivative-based equivalents. the range disclosed in the previous table signifies the number of points by which the synthetic bond equivalent price is higher than the quoted price of the underlying cash bonds.
•funding spread. the cost of borrowing defined as the incremental spread over the ois rate for a specific collateral rate (which refers to the rate applicable to a specific type of security pledged as collateral).
•loss given default. amount expressed as a percentage of par that is the expected loss when a credit event occurs.
•margin loan rate. the annualized rate that reflects the possibility of losses as a result of movements in the price of the underlying margin loan collateral. the rate is calibrated from the discount rate, credit spreads and/or volatility measures.
•wacc. wacc represents the theoretical rate of return required to debt and equity investors. the wacc is used in a discounted cash flow model that calculates the value of the equity. the model assumes that the cash flow assumptions, including projections, are fully reflected in the current equity value, while the debt to equity ratio is held constant.
an increase (decrease) to the following significant unobservable inputs would generally result in an impact to the fair value, but the magnitude and direction of the impact would depend on whether the firm is long or short the exposure.
•correlation. a pricing input where the payoff is driven by more than one underlying risk. correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movement of two variables (i.e., how the change in one variable influences a change in the other variable).
•credit spread. the credit spread reflects the additional net yield an investor can earn from a security with more credit risk relative to one with less credit risk. the credit spread of a particular security is often quoted in relation to the yield on a credit risk-free benchmark security or reference rate.
•interest rate curve. the term structure of interest rates (relationship between interest rates and the time to maturity) and a market's measure of future interest rates at the time of observation. an interest rate curve is used to set interest rate and foreign exchange derivative cash flows and is a pricing input used in the discounting of any otc derivative cash flow.
•volatility. the measure of variability in possible returns for an instrument given how much that instrument changes in value over time. volatility is a pricing input for options, and, generally, the lower the volatility, the less risky the option. the level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular option depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the risk underlying that option, the tenor and the strike price of the option.
•volatility skew. the measure of the difference in implied volatility for options with identical underliers and expiry dates but with different strikes.

amounts in the previous table represent the firm's carrying value of general and limited partnership interests in fund investments, as well as any related performance-based income in the form of carried interest. the carrying amounts are measured based on the nav of the fund taking into account the distribution terms applicable to the interest held. this same measurement applies whether the fund investments are accounted for under the equity method or fair value.
private equity.  funds that pursue multiple strategies, including leveraged buyouts, venture capital, infrastructure growth capital, distressed investments and mezzanine capital. in addition, the funds may be structured with a focus on specific geographic regions.
real estate.  funds that invest in real estate assets such as commercial office buildings, retail properties, multifamily residential properties, developments or hotels. in addition, the funds may be structured with a focus on specific geographic regions.
investments in private equity and real estate funds generally are not redeemable due to the closed-end nature of these funds. instead, distributions from each fund will be received as the underlying investments of the funds are disposed and monetized.
hedge.  funds that pursue various investment strategies, including long-short equity, fixed income/credit, event-driven and multi-strategy. investments in hedge funds may be subject to initial period lock-up or gate provisions, which restrict an investor from withdrawing from the fund during a certain initial period or restrict the redemption amount on any redemption date, respectively.

1.gains and losses for loans and other assets-other investments are classified in other revenues. for other items, gains and losses are recorded in other revenues if the item is held for sale; otherwise, they are recorded in other expenses.
2.nonrecurring changes in the fair value of loans and lending commitments, which exclude the impact of related economic hedges, are calculated as follows: for the held-for-investment category, based on the value of the underlying collateral; and for the held-for-sale category, based on recently executed transactions, market price quotations, valuation models that incorporate market observable inputs where possible, such as comparable loan or debt prices and cds spread levels adjusted for any basis difference between cash and derivative instruments, or default recovery analysis where such transactions and quotations are unobservable.
3.losses related to other assets-other investments were determined using techniques that included discounted cash flow models, methodologies that incorporate multiples of certain comparable companies and recently executed transactions.
4.losses related to other assets-premises, equipment and software generally include impairments as well as write-offs related to the disposal of certain assets.
5.losses related to other assets-rou assets include impairments related to the discontinued leased properties.

the firm enters into credit derivatives, principally cds, under which it receives or provides protection against the risk of default on a set of debt obligations issued by a specified reference entity or entities. a majority of the firm's counterparties for these derivatives are banks, broker-dealers, and insurance and other financial institutions.
the fair value amounts as shown in the previous tables are prior to cash collateral or counterparty netting.
the purchase of credit protection does not represent the sole manner in which the firm risk manages its exposure to credit derivatives. the firm manages its exposure to these derivative contracts through a variety of risk mitigation strategies, which include managing the credit and correlation risk across single-name, non-tranched indices and baskets, tranched indices and baskets, and cash positions. aggregate market risk limits have been established for credit derivatives, and market risk measures are routinely monitored against these limits. the firm may also recover amounts on the underlying reference obligation delivered to the firm under cds where credit protection was sold.
single-name cds.  a cds protects the buyer against the loss of principal on a bond or loan in case of a default by the issuer. the protection buyer pays a periodic premium (generally quarterly) over the life of the contract and is protected for the period. the firm, in turn, performs under a cds if a credit event as defined under the contract occurs. typical credit events include bankruptcy, dissolution or insolvency of the referenced entity, failure to pay and restructuring of the obligations of the referenced entity.
index and basket cds.  index and basket cds are products where credit protection is provided on a portfolio of single-name cds. generally, in the event of a default on one of the underlying names, the firm pays a pro rata portion of the total notional amount of the cds.
the firm also enters into tranched index and basket cds where credit protection is provided on a particular portion of the portfolio loss distribution. the most junior tranches cover initial defaults, and once losses exceed the notional of the
111               december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements tranche, they are passed on to the next most senior tranche in the capital structure.
other credit contracts.  the firm has invested in clns and cdos, which are hybrid instruments containing embedded derivatives, in which credit protection has been sold to the issuer of the note. if there is a credit event of a reference entity underlying the instrument, the principal balance of the note may not be repaid in full to the firm.

113               december 2023 form 10-k notes to consolidated financial statements the risk related to a decline in the market value of collateral pledged or received is managed by setting appropriate market-based margin requirements. increases in collateral margin calls on secured financing due to market value declines may be mitigated by increases in collateral margin calls on securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed transactions with similar quality collateral. additionally, the firm may request lower quality collateral pledged be replaced with higher quality collateral through collateral substitution rights in the underlying agreements.
the firm actively manages its secured financings in a manner that reduces the potential refinancing risk of secured financings of less liquid assets and also considers the quality of collateral when negotiating collateral eligibility with counterparties. the firm utilizes shorter term secured financing for highly liquid assets and has established longer tenor limits for less liquid assets, for which funding may be at risk in the event of a market disruption.

margin and other lending         $45,644                    $38,524
the firm provides margin lending arrangements that allow customers to borrow against the value of qualifying securities. receivables from these arrangements are included within customer and other receivables in the balance sheet. under these arrangements, the firm receives collateral, which includes u.s. government and agency securities, other sovereign government obligations, corporate and other debt, and corporate equities. margin loans are collateralized by customer-owned securities held by the firm. the firm monitors required margin levels and established credit terms daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, requires customers to deposit additional collateral, or reduce positions, when necessary.
margin loans are extended on a demand basis and generally are not committed facilities. factors considered in the review of margin loans are the amount of the loan, the intended purpose, the degree of leverage being employed in the account and the amount of collateral, as well as an overall evaluation of the portfolio to ensure proper diversification or, in the case of concentrated positions, appropriate liquidity of the underlying collateral or potential hedging strategies to reduce risk. underlying collateral for margin loans is reviewed with respect to the liquidity of the proposed collateral positions, valuation of securities, historic trading range, volatility analysis and an evaluation of industry concentrations. for these transactions, adherence to the firm's collateral policies significantly limits its credit exposure in the event of a customer default. the firm may request additional margin collateral from customers, if appropriate, and, if necessary, may sell securities that have not been paid for or purchase securities sold but not delivered from customers.
also included in the amounts in the previous table is non-purpose securities-based lending on entities in the wealth management business segment.
other secured financings other secured financings include the liabilities related to collateralized notes, transfers of financial assets that are accounted for as financings rather than sales and consolidated vies where the firm is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. these liabilities are generally payable from the cash flows of the related assets accounted for as trading assets (see notes 13 and 15). additionally, for certain secured financing transactions that the firm entered into during 2023 that meet applicable netting criteria, the firm offsets other secured financing liabilities against financing receivables recorded within trading assets in the amount of $3,472 million at december 31, 2023.

credit quality the crm evaluates new obligors before credit transactions are initially approved and at least annually thereafter for corporate and commercial real estate loans. for corporate, secured lending facilities and other loans, credit evaluations typically involve the evaluation of financial statements, assessment of leverage, liquidity, capital strength, asset composition and quality, market capitalization and access to capital markets, cash flow projections and debt service requirements, and the adequacy of collateral, if applicable. the crm also evaluates strategy, market position, industry dynamics, obligor's management and other factors that could affect an obligor's risk profile.
for commercial real estate loans, the credit evaluation is focused on property and transaction metrics, including property type, ltv ratio, occupancy levels, debt service ratio, prevailing capitalization rates and market dynamics.
for residential real estate and securities-based loans, the initial credit evaluation typically includes, but is not limited to, review of the obligor's income, net worth, liquidity, collateral, ltv ratio and credit bureau information. subsequent credit monitoring for residential real estate loans is performed at the portfolio level. securities-based loan collateral values are monitored on an ongoing basis.
for information related to credit quality indicators considered in developing the acl, see note 2.

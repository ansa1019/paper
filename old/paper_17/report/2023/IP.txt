item 1a. risk factors the company faces a variety of risks, including risks in the normal course of business and through global, regional, and local events that could have an adverse impact on its reputation, operations, and financial performance.
the following are material risk factors of which we are aware, including risk factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in any forward-looking statement. if any of the events or circumstances described in any of the following risk factors occurs, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected, and our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in any forward-looking statements we make in any public disclosures. additional factors that could affect our business, results of operations and/or financial condition are discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k (including in item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations) and in the company's other filings with the securities and exchange commission. moreover, risks or uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
risks relating to market and economic factors adverse developments in general business and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and our financial condition and results of operations. general economic conditions may adversely affect industrial non-durable goods production, consumer confidence and spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, and white-collar employment levels, all of which impact demand for our products, or otherwise adversely affect our business. we may also be adversely affected by catastrophic or other unforeseen events, including health epidemics or pandemics, such as covid-19, natural disasters, geopolitical events, military conflicts, terrorism, port and canal blockages and similar disruptions, political, financial or social instability, or civil or social unrest. future health pandemics could adversely impact portions of our business to varying degrees, including as the result of lower demand for certain products, supply chain and labor disruptions, and higher costs. these effects could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, or financial condition. moreover, negative economic conditions or other adverse developments with respect to our business have resulted in, and may in the future result in impairment charges which could be material. volatility or uncertainty in the financial, capital and credit markets, and negative developments associated with interest rates, asset values, currency exchange rates and the availability of credit, could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and our results of operations.
macroeconomic conditions in the u.s. and globally continue to be challenging in various respects, including as the result of significant inflationary pressures, elevated interest rates, challenging labor market conditions, and adverse effects associated with current geopolitical conditions. our operations have been adversely affected by, and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by, these negative macroeconomic conditions, including as the result of lower demand for certain products, higher raw material and labor costs. moreover, any significant deterioration in current negative macroeconomic conditions, or any recovery therefrom that is significantly slower than anticipated, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. further if current negative macroeconomic conditions result in significant disruptions to capital and financial markets, our cost of borrowing, our ability to access capital on favorable terms, and our overall liquidity could be adversely affected.
the covid-19 pandemic adversely impacted portions of our business to varying degrees, including as the result of lower demand for certain of our products, supply chain and labor disruptions, and higher costs. if public health conditions related to covid-19 or a similar health epidemic or pandemic were to significantly worsen in the u.s. or in other markets in which we operate, our business and financial results could be adversely impacted, and we may be unable to effectively respond to or predict any such developments.
changes in international conditions or other risks arising from conducting business internationally could adversely affect our business and results of operations. as a global producer of renewable fiber-based packaging and pulp products, we could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the u.s. in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products. these risks, which can vary substantially by country, may include economic or political instability, geopolitical events, corruption, anti-american sentiment, social and ethnic unrest, natural disasters, military conflicts and terrorism, the regulatory environment (including the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of legal requirements and the enforceability of contracts rights and intellectual property rights) fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the u.s. dollar, foreign exchange control regimes (including restrictions on currency conversion) repatriating cash from foreign countries to the u.s., downturns or changes in economic conditions (including in relation to commodity inflation), adverse tax consequences or rulings, import restrictions or controls, economic sanctions, health guidelines and safety protocols, nationalization, changes in social, political or labor conditions, and adverse developments regarding sustainability, environmental regulations and trade policies and agreements, any of which risks could negatively affect our financial results. for example, a significant portion of sales from our global cellulose fibers business are concentrated in china and could be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions and demographics in china. trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products, including governmental subsidies, tax benefits and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over us, may also adversely impact our operating results and business prospects in these countries. likewise, disruption in existing trade agreements or increased trade friction between countries (such as in relation to the trade tensions between the u.s. and china), which may result in tariffs, could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations by restricting the free flow of goods and services across borders.
during the third quarter of 2023, we completed the sale of our ownership stake in ilim and ilim group, and we no longer have investments in russia following the completion of this sale. prior to the completion of this sale, the military conflict between russia and ukraine adversely affected our ilim joint venture and our financial results, including as the result of economic sanctions, actions by the russian government, and associated domestic and global economic and geopolitical conditions. additionally, while we no longer have any investments in russia, we may continue to be adversely affected by ongoing geopolitical instability and the economic consequences and disruptions arising therefrom, including as the result of the military conflict between russia and ukraine, the military conflict between israel and hamas, and increasing tensions between china and taiwan. these risks may be further heightened in the event of the expansion in the scope or escalation of any such military conflicts.
in addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under u.s. law and other laws related to operations in foreign jurisdictions, including laws prohibiting bribery of government officials and other corrupt practices. for example, the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977, as amended, prohibits u.s. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad, and the u.s. department of treasury's office of foreign assets control and other non-u.s. government entities maintain economic sanctions targeting various countries, persons and entities. failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, damage to our reputation and the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations.
risks related to climate and weather we are subject to risks associated with climate change and other sustainability matters and global, regional and local weather conditions as well as by legal, regulatory, and market responses to climate change. climate change impacts, including rising temperatures and the increasing severity and/or frequency of adverse weather conditions, may result in operational impacts on our facilities, supply chain disruptions and increased raw material and other costs. these adverse weather conditions and other physical impacts which may be exacerbated as the result of climate change include floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, hailstorms, wildfires, snow, ice storms and drought. climate change may also contribute to the decreased productivity of forests and adverse impacts on the distribution and abundance of species, and the spread of disease and insect epidemics, any of which developments could adversely affect timber harvesting. the effects of climate change and global, regional and local weather conditions, including the resulting financial costs of compliance with legal or regulatory initiatives, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.
there has been an increased focus, including from investors, customers, the general public, u.s. and foreign governmental and nongovernmental authorities, regarding sustainability matters, including with respect to climate change, ghg emissions, packaging and waste, sustainable supply chain practices, biodiversity, deforestation, land, energy and water use, diversity and inclusion and other human capital matters. this increased focus on sustainability matters, including climate change, may result in more prescriptive reporting requirements with respect to sustainability metrics, an increased expectation that such metrics will be voluntarily disclosed by companies such as ours, and increased pressure to make commitments, set targets, or establish goals, and take action to meet them. as the result of this increased focus and our commitment to sustainability matters, we have voluntarily provided disclosure and established targets and goals with respect to various sustainability matters, including climate change. for example, we have made public commitments regarding our intended reduction of carbon emissions, including our vision 2030 goal of reducing scope 1, 2 and 3 ghg emissions by 35% from 2019-2030, which have been approved by sbti as consistent with levels required to meet the goals of the 2015 paris agreement. meeting these and other sustainability targets and goals have increased, and may continue to increase, our capital and operational costs. there also continues to be a lack of consistency in legal and regulatory initiatives regarding climate change across jurisdictions and various governmental entities. we also expect to incur additional expenses as a result of u.s. and international regulators requiring additional disclosures regarding ghg emissions. further, there can be no assurance regarding the extent to which our climate and other sustainability targets will be achieved, and the achievement of these targets is subject to various risks and uncertainties, some of which are outside our control. moreover, there is no assurance that investments made in furtherance of achieving such targets and goals will meet investor expectations or any binding or non-binding legal standards regarding sustainability performance. if we are unable to meet climate and other sustainability targets and goals, on our projected timelines or at all, or if such goals and targets are perceived negatively, including the perception that they are not sufficiently robust or, conversely, are too costly or not otherwise in our best interests, any such developments could adversely impact our reputation as well as investor, customer and other stakeholder relationships, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. moreover, not all of our competitors establish climate or other sustainability targets and goals at comparable levels to ours, which could result in competitors having lower supply chain or operating costs as well as reduced reputational risks associated with not meeting such goals.
other climate-related business risks that we face include risks related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy, such as increased prices for fossil fuels; the introduction of a carbon tax; increased regulation of our operations and our products, and the resulting potential for increased litigation; and more stringent and/or complex environmental and other permitting requirements. to the extent that climate-related business risks materialize, particularly if we are unprepared for them, we may incur unexpected costs, and our business may be materially and adversely affected.
risks related to our indebtedness the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business. as of december 31, 2023, we had approximately $5.6 billion of outstanding indebtedness. the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial condition, operating results and business, including the following:
•it may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, dividends, share repurchases, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;
•a portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to payments on indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes, including operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;
•the debt service requirements of our indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy other obligations;
•it may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions, including to take actions in connection with elevated interest rates (such as in the current elevated interest rate environment), and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;
•it may increase our exposure to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency as we earn profits in a variety of currencies around the world and our debt is denominated in u.s. dollars;
•it may increase our exposure to the risk of increased interest rates insofar as we are compelled to refinance indebtedness at higher interest rates, which risk is heightened by the current high interest rate environment; and
•it may increase our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business, and may make us unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth.
in addition, we are subject to agreements governing our indebtedness that require us to meet and maintain certain financial ratios and covenants. a significant or prolonged downturn in general business and economic conditions, or other significant adverse developments with respect to our results of operations or financial condition, may affect our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our current business objectives. moreover, the restrictions associated with these financial ratios and covenants may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. additionally, despite these restrictions, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility and otherwise increase the risks associated with our indebtedness as noted above.
we are subject to risks associated with our variable rate debt we have interest rate risk, primarily related to variable rate debt in the aggregate amount of approximately $908 million as of december 31, 2023, associated with our short-term cash investments, variable rate debts, supply chain financing, short-term debt and the installment notes and loans in the temple-inland timber monetization special purpose entities. interest rates rose significantly during 2022 and 2023 and could remain high and volatile in 2024 and beyond. changes in interest rates impact how much we earn on our short-term cash investments, the interest rate we pay on our variable rate debt and credit agreements, the cost of supply chain financing and the refinance rate of our short-term debt. for additional information, see "market risk - interest rate risk" in item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page 44.
changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. maintaining an investment-grade credit rating is an important element of our financial strategy. a downgrade of the company's ratings below investment grade will likely eliminate our ability to access the commercial paper market, may limit our access to the capital markets, have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities, increase our cost of borrowing and require us to post collateral for derivatives in a net liability position. our desire to maintain the company's investment grade rating may cause us to take certain actions designed to improve our cash flow, including sale of assets, suspension or reduction of our dividend and reductions in capital expenditures and working capital.
under the terms of the agreements governing approximately $1.1 billion of our debt as of december 31, 2023, the applicable interest rate on such debt may increase upon each downgrade in our credit rating. as a result, a downgrade in our credit rating may lead to an increase in our interest expense. there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in each rating agency's judgment, circumstances so warrant. any such downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of borrowing, limit our access to the capital markets or result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur.
downgrades in the credit ratings of banks issuing certain letters of credit will increase our cost of maintaining certain indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of deferred taxes. we are subject to the risk that a bank with currently issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting installment notes in connection with temple-inland's 2007 sales of forestlands, may be downgraded below a required rating. prior to 2013, certain banks had fallen below the required ratings threshold and were successfully replaced, or waivers were obtained regarding their replacement. as a result of continuing uncertainty in the banking environment, some of the letter-of-credit banks currently in place remain subject to risk of downgrade and the number of qualified replacement banks remains limited. the downgrade of one or more of these banks may subject us to additional costs of securing a replacement letter-of-credit bank or could result in an acceleration of payments of up to $485 million in deferred income taxes if replacement banks cannot be obtained. the deferred taxes are currently recorded in our consolidated financial statements. see note 15, variable interest entities, on pages 78 through 80, and note 13. income taxes, on pages 72 through 74, in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information.
risks relating to our pension and healthcare costs our pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors which could cause these costs to change. we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all u.s. salaried employees hired prior to july 1, 2004 (or later for certain acquired populations, as described in note 18. retirement plans, on pages 82 through 87, in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data) and substantially all hourly union and non-union employees regardless of hire date. we froze participation under these plans for u.s. salaried employees, including credited service and compensation on or after january 1, 2019; however, the pension freeze does not affect benefits accrued through december 31, 2018. we provide retiree health care benefits to certain former u.s. employees, as well as financial assistance towards the cost of individual retiree medical coverage for certain former u.s. salaried employees. our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. fluctuations in actual market returns on plan assets, changes in general interest rates and in the number of retirees may impact pension costs in future periods. likewise, changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could increase pension costs. however, the impact of market fluctuations has been reduced as a result of investments in our pension plan asset portfolio which hedge the impact of changes in interest rates on the plan's funded status. drivers for fluctuating health costs include unit cost changes, health care utilization by participants, and potential changes in legal requirements and government oversight.
our u.s. funded pension plan is currently fully funded on a projected benefit obligation basis; however, the possibility exists that over time we may be required to make cash payments to the plan, reducing the cash available for our business. we record an asset or a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the surplus of the fair value of plan assets above the benefit obligation or the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets. at december 31, 2023, we had an overfunded u.s. qualified pension asset balance of $118 million. when aggregated with u.s. nonqualified pension obligations, the benefit deficit recorded under the provisions of accounting standards codification ("asc") 715, "compensation - retirement benefits," at december 31, 2023 was $146 million. the amount and timing of future contributions, which could be material, will depend upon a number of factors, including the actual earnings, changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates.
risks relating to industry conditions changes in the cost or availability of raw materials, energy and transportation have recently affected, and could continue to affect our profitability. we rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials (principally virgin wood fiber, recycled fiber, caustic soda, starch and adhesives), energy sources (principally biomass, natural gas, electricity and fuel oil) and third-party companies that transport our goods. the market price of virgin wood fiber varies based upon availability and source. the global supply and demand for recycled fiber may be affected by factors such as trade policies between countries, individual governments' legislation and regulations, and general macroeconomic conditions. in addition, the increase in demand of products manufactured, in whole or in part, from recycled fiber, on a global basis, may cause significant fluctuations in recycled fiber prices. taking into account ongoing inflationary conditions in the u.s. and globally, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, a significant increase in various costs, including recycled fiber, energy, freight, chemical, and other supply chain costs, which has adversely affected and is expected to continue to adversely affect our results of operations. energy prices, in particular prices for oil and natural gas, have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to increase and/or fluctuate in the future. moreover, the availability of labor and the market price for fuel may affect our costs for third-party transportation. in addition, because our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments, we may have not always been able, and may in the future be unable to recoup past or future increases in the costs of any raw materials, energy sources or transportation sources through price increases to our customers. our profitability has been, and will continue to be, affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials, energy sources and transportation sources.
fluctuations in the prices of and the demand for our products due to factors such as economic cyclicality and changes in customer or consumer preferences, and government regulation could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions. the length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product. in addition, changes in customer or consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our fiber-based products and non-fiber substitutes. moreover, customer and consumer preferences are constantly changing based on, among other factors, cost, convenience, health concerns and perceptions and an increased awareness of sustainability considerations. these preferences may affect the prices of our products. in addition, regulatory developments, such as new or developing regulation or single-use packaging products could significantly alter the market for our products. consequently, our financial results are sensitive to changes in the pricing, and supply and demand for our products. in addition, our reputation and financial results may be adversely affected if we fail to anticipate trends that would enable us to offer products that respond to changing customer preferences and technological and regulatory developments.
competition in the u.s. and internationally could negatively impact our financial results. we operate in a competitive environment, both in the u.s. and internationally, in all of our operating segments. our products compete with similar products produced by other forest products companies. product innovations, manufacturing and operating efficiencies, additional manufacturing capacity, marketing, distribution and pricing strategies pursued or achieved by competitors, the increased use of artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions in our industry, and the entry of new competitors into the markets we serve could negatively impact our financial results. in addition, our products also compete, in some instances, with companies in other industries that produce substitutes for wood-fiber products, such as plastics and various types of metal. customer shifts away from wood-fiber products toward such substitute products may adversely affect our business and financial results.
risks relating to our operations material disruptions at one of our manufacturing facilities could negatively impact our financial results. we operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities. a material disruption at our corporate headquarters or one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and/or negatively impact our financial condition. any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:
•adverse weather events like fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, winter storms and extreme temperatures, or other catastrophes (including adverse weather conditions that may be intensified by climate change);
•the effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on its water supply;
•disruption in the supply of raw materials or other manufacturing inputs;
•terrorism or threats of terrorism;
•information system disruptions or failures due to any number of causes, including cyber-attacks;
•domestic and international laws and regulations applicable to us and our business partners, including joint venture partners, around the world;
•unscheduled maintenance outages;
•prolonged power failures;
•an equipment failure;
•a chemical spill or release;
•explosion of a boiler or other equipment;
•damage or disruptions caused by third parties operating on or adjacent to one of our manufacturing facilities;
•disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels;
•a widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis or any impacts related to government regulation as a result thereof;
•failure of our third-party service providers and business partners to satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities in a timely manner and in accordance with agreed upon terms;
•labor difficulties; and
•other operational problems.
any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products and/or require us to make unplanned expenditures. if one of our machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime, our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired, resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our business and financial results.
we may not achieve the expected benefits from strategic acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, spin-offs, capital investments, capital projects and other corporate transactions that we have pursued or may pursue.  our strategy for long-term growth, productivity and profitability depends, in part, on our ability to accomplish prudent acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, spin-offs, capital investments, capital projects, and other corporate transactions that we may pursue and to realize the benefits we expect from such transactions. our expenditures for capital projects could be higher than we anticipate, we may experience unanticipated disruptions or delays in completing the projects and we may not achieve the desired benefits from those projects, including as a result of a deterioration in macroeconomic conditions in our business, unavailability of capital equipment or related materials, delays in obtaining permits or other requisite approvals or changes in laws and regulations. we are subject to the risk that we may not achieve the expected benefits from such transactions. this failure could require us to record an impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible assets, which could lead to decreased assets and reduced net earnings. among the benefits we expect from potential as well as completed acquisitions and joint ventures are synergies, cost savings, growth opportunities and access to new markets (or a combination thereof), and in the case of divestitures, the realization of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets to purchasers who place a higher strategic value on such businesses and assets than we do.
corporate transactions of this nature that we may pursue involve a number of special risks, including with respect to our inability to realize our business goals with such transactions as noted above, the focus of our management's attention on these transactions and the assimilation of acquired businesses into our operations, the demands on our financial, operational and information technology systems resulting from acquired businesses, and the possibility that we may become responsible for substantial contingent or unanticipated legal liabilities as the result of acquisitions or other corporate transactions.
any of these circumstances could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the trading price of our common stock.
we could be exposed to liability for brazilian taxes under our agreements with sylvamo corporation. in connection with the spin-off of sylvamo corporation ("sylvamo"), we previously entered into agreements with sylvamo and its subsidiaries, including among others a tax matters agreement. under the tax matters agreement, we could have significant payment obligations in connection with certain brazilian tax matters. under this agreement, we have agreed to pay 60% of the first $300 million of any liability resulting from the resolution of these brazilian tax matters (with sylvamo paying the remaining 40% of the first $300 million of any such liability) and 100% of any liability resulting from the brazilian tax matters over $300 million. the assessments for the tax years 2007-2015 total approximately $119 million (adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates) in tax, plus interest, penalties, and fees. the interest, penalties, and fees currently total approximately $274 million (adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates), which reflects a recent law change pursuant to which the brazil tax authority on january 16, 2024 agreed to cancel a portion of the interest, penalties, and fees. accordingly, the assessments currently total approximately $393 million (adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates). see note 14 commitments and contingent liabilities on pages 74 through 78 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information.
we operate in a challenging market for talent and may fail to attract and retain qualified personnel, including key management personnel. our ability to operate and grow our business depends on our ability to attract and retain employees with the skills necessary to operate and maintain our facilities, produce our products and serve our customers. the market for both hourly workers and salaried workers continues to be competitive, particularly for employees with specialized technical and trade experience. this, along with the current competitive labor market and ongoing inflationary conditions, has led to higher labor costs, particularly at our converting facilities. although our focused efforts to attract and retain employees, including by offering higher levels of compensation in certain instances, resulted in a decreased attrition rate in 2023 compared to the prior two years' historically high attrition rates, recruiting and retaining talent (particularly those early in their careers) continues to be a challenge. in addition, we rely on key executive and management personnel to manage our business efficiently and effectively. the loss of key executive and management employees, particularly in a challenging market for attracting and retaining employees, could adversely affect our business.
moreover, changing demographics and labor work force trends, including remote work and changing work-life balance expectations, may make it difficult for us to replace retiring or departing employees. if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel, or if we continue to experience excessive turnover, we may continue to experience higher labor costs and labor shortages, and our business may be adversely impacted.
in addition, a significant number of our employees are represented by unions. we may not be able to successfully negotiate new union contracts once our current contracts with unions expire without work stoppages or labor difficulties, or we may be unable to renegotiate such contracts on favorable terms. negotiations between the company and usw regarding the mill master collective bargaining agreement (which expired august 2023) and related mill joint pension council master agreement (which expired september 2023) resulted in new agreements which will expire august 2027 and september 2027, respectively. negotiations between the company and usw regarding the converting master collective bargaining agreement (which expires april 2024) and related converting joint pension council master (which expires september 2024) are scheduled to begin on february 19, 2024. usw represents approximately 10,600 employees in our converting facilities. we have also experienced work stoppages in the past and may experience them in the future. moreover, labor organizations may attempt to organize groups of additional employees from time to time, recent and potential changes in labor laws could make it easier for them to do so. if we experience any extended interruption of operations at any of our facilities as a result of strikes or other work stoppages or if unions are able to organize additional groups of our employees, our operating costs increase and our operational flexibility could be reduced.
we are subject to cybersecurity and information technology risks related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive company, customer, employee and vendor information as well as breaches in the technology used to manage operations and other business processes. our business operations rely upon securely managed information technology systems, some of which are provided or managed by third parties, for data capture, processing, storage and reporting. we have invested in information technology security initiatives and risk management, as well as incident response, business continuity and disaster recovery plans but we cannot eliminate all systematic or external risk. the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring, testing and updating as technologies and processes change, and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated. additionally, the regulatory environment surrounding information security data privacy and data protection is becoming increasingly restrictive and is evolving frequently.
the current cyber threat environment presents increased risk for all companies, including those in our industry. like other global companies, our systems are subject to recurring attempts by third parties to access information, manipulate data or disrupt our operations. in this regard, we have experienced cyber threats and incidents, although none have materially affected us, including our results of operations or financial condition. given the current cyber threat environment, we expect the volume and intensity of cybersecurity attacks and attempted intrusions to increase in the future. in addition, despite careful security and controls design, implementation, updating, monitoring and independent third-party verification, our information technology systems, and those of our third-party providers or joint venture partners, could be compromised or disrupted due to employee error or malfeasance, cyber-attacks, including ransomware, malware, phishing attacks, or data or security breaches by malicious actors such as common hackers, criminal groups or nation-state organizations or social activist ("hacktivist") organizations, disruptions resulting from geopolitical events, natural disasters, failures or impairments of telecommunications networks or other catastrophic events. such attacks are increasing in complexity, and the rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may intensify our cybersecurity risks by making cyberattacks more difficult to detect, contain, and mitigate. furthermore, the significant increase in remote working and personal device use increases the risks of cyber incidents and the improper dissemination of personal or confidential information. moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent vulnerabilities or defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security. in addition, the cybersecurity-related threats that we face may remain undetected for an extended period of time. in the event that our information systems are disrupted or compromised, or the information systems of any businesses with which we interact, are disrupted or compromised, in a manner which impacts us or our information systems, as a result of any cybersecurity attack, data or security breach, or other security incident, any such developments could result in lost sales, business delays, negative publicity or reputational impact, and a loss of customer confidence, and have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results. any such incident or breach could also result in operational or supply chain disruptions, data loss, corruption or manipulation, or information misappropriation including, but not limited to, interruption to systems availability, denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with us, the acquisition, use or disclosure of data or inability to access data, the release of confidential information about our operations, and subject us to litigation and government enforcement actions. further, in such event, access to applications required to plan our operations, source materials, manufacture and ship finished goods and account for orders could be denied or misused. theft of intellectual property or trade secrets, and loss or inappropriate disclosure of confidential company, employee, customer or vendor information, could also stem from such incidents. moreover, any significant cybersecurity event could require us to devote significant management time and resources in response to such event, interfere with the pursuit of other important business strategies and initiatives, and cause us to incur additional expenditures, which could be material, including to investigate and remediate such event, recover lost data, prevent future compromises and adapt systems and practices in response to such events. there is no assurance that any remedial actions will meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information systems, particularly because malicious actors are increasingly sophisticated and utilize tools and techniques specifically designed to circumvent security measures, avoid detection and obfuscate forensic evidence, which means we may be unable to identify, investigate or remediate effectively or in a timely manner. additionally, while we have insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks in place, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in connection with such incidents.
we may be unable to realize the expected benefits and costs savings associated with restructuring initiatives, including our strategic actions announced in october 2023. we have restructured portions of our operations from time to time, have current restructuring initiatives taking place, and it is likely that we will engage in restructuring activities in the future. in particular, as previously disclosed in october 2023, the company committed to certain strategic actions impacting its containerboard and global cellulose fibers businesses as further described below. consistent with this initiative, in december 2023, the company permanently closed its containerboard mill in orange, texas and permanently ceased production on two of its pulp machines at its riegelwood, north carolina and pensacola, florida mills. the company recorded charges associated with these actions during the three months ended december 31, 2023. see note 6 - restructuring and other charges, net in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for additional information.
we may be unable to realize the expected benefits from the strategic actions described above and other restructuring initiatives which we may take. in particular, restructuring activities may divert the attention of management, disrupt our operations and fail to achieve the intended cost and operational benefits. in addition, because we are not able to predict or control market conditions, including changes in the supply and demand for our products, the prices for our products or our manufacturing costs, we may not be able to predict the appropriate time to undertake restructurings. further, we may incur cash and non-cash charges in connection with restructuring activities, which may be material. moreover, judgment is required to estimate restructuring charges, and these estimates, and the assumptions underlying them, may change as additional information becomes available or facts or circumstances related to restructuring initiatives change.
risks relating to legal proceedings and compliance costs we are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and other government requirements that may change in significant ways, and the cost of compliance with such requirements, or the failure to comply with such requirements, could impact our business and results of operations. our operations are subject to regulation under a wide variety of u.s. federal and state and non-u.s. laws, regulations and other government requirements - including, among others, those relating to the environment, health and safety, labor and employment, data privacy, tax, trade and health care. there can be no assurance that laws, regulations and government requirements will not be changed, applied or interpreted in ways that will require us to modify our operations and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, or subjecting us to increased costs. in addition, any failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or other government requirements could adversely affect our reputation, and financial results or result in, among other things, litigation, revocation of required licenses, internal investigations, governmental investigations or proceedings, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability.
for example, as part of our business, we are subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local and international laws governing the protection of the environment. we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant capital, operating and other expenditures complying with applicable and forthcoming environmental laws and regulations, including with respect to ghg emissions and other climate-related matters. additionally, new environmental laws, regulations or other requirements to address ghg emissions or climate change may cause us to incur additional compliance costs, including costs that we are unable to predict at the current time. moreover, there has historically been, and may continue to be, a lack of consistency between jurisdictions regarding legal requirements with respect to climate and ghg emission matters, which has created and may continue to create economic and regulatory uncertainty. our environmental expenditures include, among other areas, those related to air and water quality, waste disposal and the cleanup of soil and groundwater, including situations where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party. moreover, we may be directly impacted by, and are working to manage, the risks and costs to us, our customers and our vendors of the effects of climate change, ghgs, and the availability of energy and water resources. these risks include the potentially adverse impact on forestlands, which are a key resource in the production of our products, increased product costs and changes in the types of products that customers purchase. there can be no assurance that future remediation requirements and compliance with existing and new laws and requirements will not require significant expenditures, or that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs. we could also incur substantial fines or sanctions, enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures), natural resource damages claims, cleanup and closure costs, third-party claims for property damage and personal injury and reputational harm as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws, regulations, codes and common law. the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict, and, in some cases, liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of hazardous substances.
our global operations subject us to complex and evolving u.s and international data privacy laws and regulations, such as european's union general data protection regulation, china's personal information protection law and comprehensive privacy laws in many states, including california, connecticut, colorado, utah, and virginia. these laws impose a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. there are significant penalties for non-compliance including monetary fines, disruption of operations and reputational harm. moreover, other states and governmental authorities around the world have introduced or passed, or are considering, similar legislation which may impose varying standards and requirements on our data collection, use and processing activities.
this increasingly restrictive and evolving regulatory environment at the international, federal and state level related to data privacy and data protection may continue to require changes to our business practices and give rise to significantly expanded compliance burdens, costs and enforcement risks. moreover, many of these laws and regulations are subject to uncertain application, interpretation or enforcement standards that could result in claims, changes to our business practices, data processing and security systems, penalties, increased operating costs or other impacts on our businesses. additionally, regulatory bodies and others tasked with enforcing privacy and data protection laws have been actively engaging in enforcement investigations and actions. these laws often provide for civil penalties for violations, as well as private rights of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. we proactively use internal and external resources to monitor compliance with relevant legislation and continually evaluate and, where necessary, modify our data processing practices and policies to comply with evolving privacy laws. nevertheless, relevant regulatory authorities could determine that our data handling practices fail to address all the requirements of certain new laws, which could subject us to penalties and/or litigation. in addition, there is no assurance that our security controls over personal data, the training of employees and vendors on data privacy and data security, and the policies, procedures and practices we implemented or may implement in the future will prevent the improper handling of, disclosure of or access to personal data. improper handling and disclosure of or access to personal data in violation of other data privacy and protection laws could harm our reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence, subject us to government enforcement actions (including fines), or result in private litigation against us, which could result in loss of revenue, increased costs, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, all of which could negatively affect our business and operating results.
we are subject to taxes in the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions, and changes in laws, regulation or interpretation of existing laws and regulations in the u.s. and other jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation, could increase our taxes and have an adverse effect on our financial results. for example, the organization for economic cooperation and development ("oecd") has proposed a 15% global minimum tax applied on a country-by-country basis (the "pillar two rule"), and many countries (including countries in which we operate) have enacted or begun the process of enacting laws adopting the pillar two rule. the first component of the pillar two rule is expected to begin applying in 2024, with the second component expected to go into effect in 2025. while we do not currently expect the pillar two rule to have a material impact on our effective tax rate, our analysis is ongoing as the oecd continues to release guidance and as countries begin implementing legislation. future developments could change our current assessment, and it is possible that the pillar two rule could adversely impact our effective tax rate in future periods.
in addition, the application of tax law is subject to interpretation and to audit by taxing authorities. additionally, administrative guidance can be incomplete or vary from legislative intent, and therefore the application of the tax law is uncertain. while we believe the positions reported by the company comply with relevant tax laws and regulations, taxing authorities could interpret our application of certain laws and regulations differently. we are currently subject to tax audits in the u.s. and other taxing jurisdictions around the world. in some cases, we have appealed, and may continue to appeal, assessments by taxing authorities in the court system. as such, tax controversy matters may result in previously unrecorded tax expenses, accelerated cash tax payments, higher future tax expenses, or the assessment of interest and penalties.
as with many technological innovations, artificial intelligence ("ai") presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. uncertainty in the legal regulatory regime relating to artificial intelligence may require significant resources to modify and maintain business practices to comply with u.s. and non-u.s. laws, the nature of which cannot be determined at this time. several jurisdictions, including europe, the u.s. federal government, and certain u.s. states, have already proposed or enacted laws, regulations, and other requirements governing ai. for example, on october 30, 2023, the biden administration issued an executive order to, among other things, establish extensive new standards for ai safety and security. other jurisdictions may decide to adopt similar or more restrictive requirements that may render the use of ai challenging. these requirements may make it harder for us to conduct our business using ai, lead to regulatory fines or penalties, require us to change our business practices, or limit our use of ai. if our use of ai is restricted, our business may be less efficient, or we may be at a competitive disadvantage. any of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
results of legal proceedings could have a material effect on our consolidated financial results. we are a party to various legal, regulatory and governmental proceedings and other related matters, including with respect to environmental matters. in addition, we are and may become subject to other loss contingencies, both known and unknown, which may relate to past, present and future facts, events, circumstances and occurrences. should an unfavorable outcome occur in connection with our legal, regulatory or governmental proceedings or other loss contingencies, or if we become subject to any such loss contingencies in the future, there could be a material adverse impact on our financial results. see note 14 commitments and contingent liabilities on pages 74 through 78 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information.
if the spin-off of sylvamo corporation were to fail to qualify for non-recognition treatment for u.s. federal income tax purposes, then international paper and our shareholders may be subject to significant u.s. federal income taxes.  the company received an opinion of tax counsel and a private letter ruling from the u.s. internal revenue service (the "irs") regarding the qualification of the spin-off of sylvamo and certain related transactions as a transaction that is generally tax-free to sylvamo, the company and the shareholders of the company for u.s. federal income tax purposes. a tax opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or a court will not take a contrary position. in addition, the company's tax counsel and the irs relied on certain representations and covenants delivered by the company and sylvamo in rendering such opinion and private letter ruling. if any of the representations or covenants relied upon for the tax opinion or private letter ruling become inaccurate, incomplete or not complied with by the company, sylvamo or any of their respective subsidiaries, the tax opinion may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.
if the irs ultimately determines that the spin-off is taxable, then the spin-off could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain to the company's shareholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes, and the company could incur significant u.s. federal income tax liabilities. these income tax liabilities may be indemnifiable by sylvamo pursuant to a tax matters agreement between the company and sylvamo. however, there can be no assurance that sylvamo would have adequate resources or liquidity if it were required to indemnify the company for any such tax liability.
even if the spin-off otherwise qualifies for non-recognition of gain or loss under section 355 of the u.s. tax code, the spin-off may be taxable to the company (but not the shareholders of the company) pursuant to section 355(e) of the code if there is a 50% or more (by vote or value) change in ownership of either the company or sylvamo, directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spin-off. for this purpose, any acquisitions of the company's or sylvamo's common stock within two years before or after the spin-off are presumed to be part of such a plan, although the company or sylvamo may be able to rebut that presumption based on either applicable facts and circumstances or a "safe harbor" described in the u.s. tax regulations.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in "financial statements and supplementary data" of this annual report on form 10-k. in addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs that involve significant risks and uncertainties. our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, particularly in "risk factors" and "forward-looking statements."
the following generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. discussion of historical items in 2021, and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021, can be found in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2022, filed with the sec on february 17, 2023, under part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
executive summary full-year 2023 net earnings attributable to shareholders were $288 million ($0.82 per diluted share) compared with $1.5 billion ($4.10 per diluted share) for full-year 2022.
during 2023, international paper executed well, both commercially and operationally, as we navigated an uncertain and challenging demand environment. during much of the year, underlying demand for our products was lower as consumers prioritized spending on services and essential goods. this trend was influenced by the pull forward of goods during the pandemic, as well as by inflationary pressures and rising interest rates that impacted the consumer. demand for our products was further constrained by inventory destocking as our customers, and the broader supply chain, worked through elevated inventories of their products. the lower demand combined with declining sales prices and continued cost inflation resulted in lower sales and earnings in 2023 as compared to 2022. during 2023, we remained focused on mitigating the impact of these challenges through commercial and cost reduction initiatives. we advanced our strategies to improve profitability across our portfolio by investing in capabilities in our industrial packaging business to enhance our value proposition to align with customer needs and optimizing our global cellulose fibers business by reducing our exposure to commodity pulp. we took strategic actions to structurally reduce fixed costs in our mill system in both our industrial packaging and global cellulose fibers businesses. we also made significant progress in building a better ip, driven by commercial and process improvement initiatives, resulting in benefits exceeding our 2023 target. regarding capital allocation in 2023, we returned approximately $840 million to shareowners including approximately $640 million of dividends and $200 million of share repurchases. finally, during 2023, we completed the sale of our ownership stake in ilim for $508 million. international paper no longer has investments in russia following completion of this sale.
comparing 2023 performance to 2022, price and mix was lower in our north american industrial packaging business due to prior index movements, lower export prices and higher export mix, as demand improved. price in our global cellulose fibers business was lower due to prior index movements and an unfavorable mix driven by lower absorbent pulp shipments. volume in both business segments was impacted by ongoing inventory destocking across the supply chain. while there was demand recovery in the second half of the year in both business segments, volume was lower in our north american industrial packaging business as consumers shifted priorities toward non-discretionary goods and services while dealing with inflation. volume in our global cellulose fibers business was also impacted by lower demand as a result of the slowdown in the global economy. operations and costs in both the north american industrial packaging and global cellulose fibers businesses were higher reflecting the impact of inflation on materials and services along with the impact of higher unabsorbed costs resulting from increased economic downtime in the current year. planned maintenance outage costs were lower in our north american industrial packaging business while higher in our global cellulose fibers business. input costs were lower in both business segments, primarily driven by lower energy, wood and distribution costs along with lower recovered fiber costs in our north american industrial packaging business.
looking ahead to the first quarter 2024, as compared to the fourth quarter 2023, we expect this quarter to be an earnings trough on seasonally lower volumes, higher costs and from the impact of the january winter freeze. we also expect the majority of prior index movements to flow through in the first quarter 2024. specifically in our industrial packaging business, we expect price to be relatively flat as prior price index movements are offset by the commercial benefits from contract restructuring in the box business. volume is expected to be lower in the first quarter 2024 due to normal seasonal declines in north america, partially offset by two more shipping days. operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings due to seasonally higher energy consumption and cost inflation on wages and employee benefits. these increases are expected to be partially offset by lower fixed costs resulting from the closure of our orange, texas mill. maintenance outage expense is expected to be higher coming off of a seasonally lower fourth quarter 2023. input costs are expected to decrease earnings on higher recovered fiber and energy costs. in our global cellulose fibers business, we expect price and mix to modestly improve as a result of our strategy to reduce exposure to commodity pulp. we expect volume to be relatively flat as seasonally lower shipments due to the chinese new year are offset by improved demand in other areas. operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings due to seasonality and cost inflation, partially offset by the non-repeat of a turbine maintenance outage and lower fixed costs resulting from the idling of our pulp machine in our riegelwood, north carolina mill. maintenance outage expense is expected to increase earnings while higher input costs associated with energy and chemicals are expected to decrease earnings.
looking at full-year 2024, we see a transitional year where markets continue to recover as we focus on improving mix and margins in both business segments through execution of our commercial strategies. we expect demand trends to continue to improve across our portfolio with year-over-year industry growth of approximately three percent for packaging and fluff pulp. additionally, we expect more than $400 million of net benefits from our commercial and operational initiatives. this includes the fixed cost reductions tied to the closure of our orange, texas containerboard mill and the permanent shutdown of two pulp machines in our global cellulose fibers business, with the benefits of both strategic actions expected to be at a full run rate by the fourth quarter 2024. these cost saving initiatives will be important in offsetting expected higher costs for recovered fiber, transportation and general inflation on wages, employee benefits, materials and services. with respect to our capital allocation framework, we are targeting capital expenditures of $800 million - $1.0 billion in 2024 for general maintenance, cost improvement and to enhance capabilities in our box business. as previously mentioned, we returned approximately $840 million of cash to shareowners in 2023 including approximately $640 million of dividends. given our strategic customer relationships, talented teams, world class assets and market expertise, we are committed to maximizing long-term value for all our stakeholders.
as previously disclosed, the company permanently closed its containerboard mill in orange, texas in december 2023 and permanently ceased production of two of its pulp machines at its riegelwood, north carolina and pensacola, florida mills on december 11, 2023. the mill closure resulted in pre-tax non-cash asset write-off and accelerated depreciation charges of approximately $347 million and pre-tax cash severance and other shutdown charges of approximately $81 million during the year ended december 31, 2023. the machine shutdowns resulted in pre-tax non-cash asset write-off and accelerated depreciation charges of approximately $75 million and pre-tax cash severance and other shutdown charges of approximately $37 million during the year ended december 31, 2023.
adjusted operating earnings and adjusted operating earnings per share are non-gaap measures and are defined as net earnings (loss) attributable to international paper (a gaap measure) excluding discontinued operations, net special items and non-operating pension expense (income). net earnings (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to common shareholders are the most directly comparable gaap measures. the company calculates adjusted operating earnings by excluding the after-tax effect of discontinued operations, non-operating pension expense (income) and items considered by management to be unusual (net special items) from net earnings (loss) attributable to shareholders reported under gaap. adjusted operating earnings per share is calculated by dividing adjusted operating earnings by diluted average shares of common stock outstanding. management uses this measure to focus on on-going operations, and believes that it is useful to investors because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present consolidated operating results from continuing operations. the company believes that using this information, along with the most directly comparable gaap measure, provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations.
the following are reconciliations of earnings (loss) attributable to common shareholders to adjusted operating earnings (loss) attributable to common shareholders on a total and per share basis. additional detail is provided later in this annual report on form 10-k regarding the net special items referenced in the charts below:

cash provided by operations, including discontinued operations, totaled approximately $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion for 2023 and 2022, respectively. the company generated free cash flow of approximately $692 million in 2023 and $1.2 billion in 2022. free cash flow is a non-gaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure is cash provided by operations. management utilizes this measure in connection with managing our business and believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures the amount of cash generated that is available, after reinvesting in the business, to maintain a strong balance sheet, pay dividends, repurchase stock, service debt and make investments for future growth. it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. by adjusting for certain items that are not indicative of the company's ongoing underlying operational performance, we believe that free cash flow also enables investors to perform meaningful comparisons between past and present periods.

liquidity and capital resources including discontinued operations, international paper generated $1.8 billion of cash flow from operations for the year ended december 31, 2023, compared with $2.2 billion in 2022. capital spending for 2023 totaled $1.1 billion, or 80% of depreciation and amortization expense. our liquidity position remains strong, supported by approximately $1.9 billion of credit facilities.
results of operations while the operating results for international paper's various business segments are driven by a number of business-specific factors, changes in international paper's operating results are closely tied to changes in general economic conditions in north america, europe, latin america, north africa and the middle east.
factors that impact the demand for our products include industrial non-durable goods production, consumer preferences, consumer spending and movements in currency exchange rates.
product prices are affected by a variety of factors including general economic trends, inventory levels, currency exchange rate movements and worldwide capacity utilization. in addition to these revenue-related factors, net earnings are impacted by various cost drivers, the more significant of which include changes in raw material costs, principally wood, recovered fiber and chemical costs; energy costs; freight costs; mill outage costs; salary and benefits costs, including pensions; and manufacturing conversion costs.
the following is a discussion of international paper's consolidated results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2023, and the major factors affecting these results compared to 2022.

see business segment results on pages 36 and 37 of item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of the impact of these factors by segment.
discontinued operations on september 18, 2023, the company completed the sale of its ilim equity investment and, as a result, all current and historical results of the ilim investment are presented as discontinued operations, net of taxes and our equity investment is no longer a separate reportable industry segment. this transaction is discussed further in note 11 - equity method investments on pages 69 and 70 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion.
discontinued operations include the equity earnings of the prior ilim joint venture. discontinued operations also includes after-tax losses of $126 million and $533 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively for impairment and transaction costs related to our former equity method investment in the ilim joint venture.
income taxes a net income tax provision from continuing operations of $59 million was recorded for 2023 and the reported effective income tax rate was 15%. this includes a tax benefit of $23 million related to the settlement of tax audits and tax expense of $4 million related to internal legal entity restructuring. excluding these items, a $141 million net tax benefit for other special items and a $13 million tax benefit related to non-operating pension expense, the operational tax provision (non-gaap) for 2023 was $232 million, or 23% of pre-tax earnings before equity earnings.
a net income tax benefit from continuing operations of $236 million was recorded for 2022 and the reported effective income tax rate was (16%). this includes a tax benefit of $604 million related to the settlement of the timber monetization restructuring tax matter, a tax benefit of $66 million related to the tax-free exchange of our shares of sylvamo and tax expense of $45 million related to a foreign deferred tax valuation allowance. excluding these items, a $37 million net tax benefit for other special items and $48 million tax expense related to non-operating pension income, the operational tax provision (non-gaap) for 2022 was $378 million, or 24% of pre-tax earnings before equity earnings.
the operational tax provision and operational effective tax rate are non-gaap financial measures and are calculated by adjusting the income tax provision from continuing operations and rate to exclude the tax effect of net special items and non-operating pension expense (income). management believes that this presentation provides useful information to investors by providing a meaningful comparison of the income tax rate between past and present periods.

description of business segments international paper's business segments discussed below are consistent with the internal structure used to manage these businesses. all segments are differentiated on a common product, common customer basis consistent with the business segmentation generally used in the forest products industry.
industrial packaging the majority of our business is focused on creating fiber-based packaging that protects and promotes goods, enables worldwide commerce and helps keep consumers safe. we meet our customers' most challenging sales, shipping, storage and display requirements with sustainable solutions. our u.s. production capacity is over 13 million tons annually.
35
our products include linerboard, medium, whitetop, recycled linerboard, recycled medium and saturating kraft. about 80% of our production is converted into corrugated packaging and other packaging by our 173 north american corrugated packaging plants. additionally, we recycle approximately one million tons of occ and mixed and white paper through our 16 u.s. recycling plants. our corrugated packaging plants are supported by regional design centers, which offer total packaging solutions and supply chain initiatives. in emea, our operations include a recycled fiber containerboard mill in morocco and one in spain and 23 corrugated packaging plants in france, italy, spain, morocco and portugal.
global cellulose fibers cellulose fibers are a sustainable, renewable raw material used in a variety of products people depend on every day. we create safe, quality pulp for a wide range of applications like diapers, towel and tissue products, feminine care, incontinence and other personal care products that promote health and wellness. in addition, our innovative specialty pulps serve as a sustainable raw material used in textiles, construction materials, paints, coatings and more. our products are made in the united states and canada and sold around the world. international paper facilities have annual dried pulp capacity of about 3 million metric tons.
business segment results the following tables present net sales and operating profit (loss) which is the company's measure of segment profitability.
industrial packaging demand for industrial packaging products is closely correlated with non-durable industrial goods production, as well as with demand for e-commerce, processed foods, poultry, meat and agricultural products. in addition to prices and volumes, major factors affecting the profitability of industrial packaging are raw material and energy costs, freight costs, mill outage costs, manufacturing efficiency and product mix.

north american industrial packaging's average sales margins were lower, reflecting lower prices for both containerboard and corrugated boxes and an unfavorable geographic mix. sales volumes decreased in 2023 compared with 2022 for corrugated boxes across our segments, reflecting a soft demand environment as consumer spending focused on non-discretionary goods and services and retailers and manufacturers pulled down inventory levels. containerboard sales volumes also decreased. total maintenance and economic downtime was about 725,000 short tons higher in 2023 compared with 2022, primarily due to economic downtime. operating and distribution costs increased, primarily due to inflation on materials and services and increased economic downtime. planned maintenance downtime costs were lower in 2023 than in 2022. input costs were significantly lower, driven by lower recovered fiber, energy and wood costs.
looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, compared with the fourth quarter of 2023, sales volumes for corrugated boxes and containerboard are expected to be seasonally lower. average sales margins are expected to be stable. operating costs are expected to increase. planned maintenance downtime costs are expected to be higher. input costs are expected to be higher, primarily for recovered fiber.

operating profit (loss)                $80           $(11)
emea industrial packaging's average sales margins were lower reflecting lower average sales prices for containerboard and an unfavorable product mix partially offset by higher average sales prices for corrugated boxes. sales volumes in 2023 were lower than in 2022 driven by soft demand. operating costs in 2023 were higher driven by inflation on materials and services. planned maintenance outage costs were lower in 2023 compared with 2022. input costs were significantly lower in 2023, driven by energy and recovered fiber costs.
entering the first quarter of 2024, compared with the fourth quarter of 2023, sales volumes are expected to be higher driven by seasonality. average sales margins are expected to be higher, reflecting lower containerboard costs. operating costs are expected to be lower. planned maintenance outage costs are expected to be lower. other input costs are expected to be stable. earnings will be impacted by the non-repeat of an energy subsidy and other favorable one-time items in the fourth quarter 2023.
global cellulose fibers demand for cellulose fibers products is closely correlated with changes in demand for absorbent hygiene products, primarily driven by the demographics and income growth in various geographic regions. it is further affected by changes in currency rates that can benefit or hurt producers in different geographic regions. principal cost drivers include manufacturing efficiency, raw material and energy costs, mill outage costs, and freight costs.

global cellulose fibers net sales for 2023 decreased 10% to $2.9 billion, compared with $3.2 billion in 2022. operating profits in 2023 decreased compared to 2022. comparing 2023 with 2022, benefits from lower input costs ($126 million) were more than offset by lower average sales price and an unfavorable mix ($72 million), lower sales volumes ($51 million), higher operating costs ($113 million) and higher maintenance outage costs ($13 million).
sales volumes in 2023 compared with 2022 were lower, driven by customer inventory destocking. total maintenance and economic downtime was about 507,000 short tons higher in 2023 compared with 2022, primarily due to economic downtime. average sales margins were lower, reflecting lower average market pulp prices and an unfavorable product mix partially offset by higher average fluff pulp prices. operating costs increased, driven by inflation on materials and services and downtime. distribution costs were lower as the global supply chain environment improved. planned maintenance outage costs were higher in 2023. input costs were lower, driven by energy, freight, wood and chemicals.
entering the first quarter of 2024, compared with the fourth quarter of 2023, sales volumes are expected to be stable. average sales margins are expected to be stable. operating costs are expected to be higher. planned maintenance outage costs are expected to be lower than in the fourth quarter of 2023. input costs are expected to be higher, primarily for energy and chemicals.
liquidity and capital resources overview a major factor in international paper's liquidity and capital resource planning is generation of operating cash flow, which is highly sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our major products. while changes in key operating cash costs, such as raw material, energy, mill outage and distribution, have an effect on operating cash generation, we believe our focus on commercial and operational excellence, as well as our ability to tightly manage costs and working capital has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle.
use of cash during 2023 was primarily focused on working capital requirements, capital spending and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases under the company's share repurchase program.
cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operations, including discontinued operations, totaled $1.8 billion in 2023, compared with $2.2 billion for 2022. cash used by working capital components (accounts receivable, contract assets and inventory less accounts payable and accrued liabilities, interest payable and other) totaled $2 million in 2023, compared with cash used by working capital components of $145 million in 2022. cash dividends received from equity investments were $13 million in 2023, compared with $204 million in 2022.
investment activities investment activities in 2023 increased from 2022. capital spending was $1.1 billion in 2023, or 80% of depreciation and amortization, compared with $931 million in 2022, or 90% of depreciation and amortization. included in 2023 depreciation expense is $347 million of accelerated depreciation related to the closure of our containerboard mill in orange, texas and $75 million of accelerated depreciation related to the permanent shutdown of pulp machines at our riegelwood, north carolina and pensacola, florida mills. capital spending as a percentage of depreciation and amortization was 62% for global cellulose fibers and 81% for industrial packaging in 2023.
the following table shows capital spending by business segment for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022:
in millions                            2023          2022
industrial packaging               $928          $762

capital spending                 $1,141          $931
capital spending in 2024 is expected to be approximately $800 million to $1.0 billion, or 78% to 97% of expected depreciation and amortization.
acquisitions see note 7 acquisitions on page 65 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for a discussion of the company's acquisitions.
financing activities financing activities during 2023 included debt issuances of $783 million and reductions of $780 million for a net increase of $3 million. financing activities during 2022 included debt issuances of $1.0 billion and reductions of $1.0 billion.
there were no early debt extinguishment amounts during the year ended december 31, 2023. amounts related to early debt extinguishment during the year ended december 31, 2022 are below:

(b)amounts are included in restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
other financing activities during 2023 included the net issuance of approximately 1.6 million shares of treasury stock. repurchases of common stock and payments of restricted stock withholding taxes totaled $218 million, including $197 million related to shares repurchased under the company's share repurchase program. through december 31, 2023, the company has repurchased 119.8 million shares at an average price of $46.23, for a total of approximately $5.5 billion, since the repurchase program began in september 2013. the company paid cash dividends totaling $642 million during 2023.
other financing activities during 2022 included the net issuance of approximately 1.6 million shares of treasury stock. in 2022, repurchases of common stock and payments of restricted stock withholding taxes totaled $1.3 billion, including $1.3 billion related to shares repurchased under the company's share repurchase program. the company paid cash dividends totaling $673 million during 2022.
interest rate swaps our policy is to manage interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. to manage this risk, international paper utilizes interest rate swaps to change the mix of fixed and variable rate debt. during 2020, international paper terminated its interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $700 million and maturities ranging from 2024 to 2026 with an approximate fair value of $85 million. subsequent to the termination of the interest rate swaps, the fair value basis adjustment is amortized to earnings as interest income over the same period as a debt premium on the previously hedged debt. the company had no outstanding interest rate swaps for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022.
variable interest entities information concerning variable interest entities is set forth in note 15 variable interest entities on pages 78 through 80 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. in connection with the 2006 international paper installment sale of forestlands, we received $4.8 billion of installment notes. these installment notes were used by variable interest entities as collateral for borrowings from third-party lenders. these variable interest entities were restructured in 2015 (the "2015 financing entities") when the installment notes and third-party loans were extended. the 2015 financing entities held installment notes of $4.8 billion and third-party loans of $4.2 billion which both matured in august 2021. we settled the third-party loans at their maturity with the proceeds from the installment notes. this resulted in cash proceeds of approximately $630 million representing our equity in the 2015 financing entities. maturity of the installment notes and termination of the monetization structure also resulted in a $72 million tax liability that was paid in the fourth quarter of 2021. on september 2, 2022, the company and the internal revenue service agreed to settle the 2015 financing entities timber monetization restructuring tax matter. under this agreement, the company agreed to fully resolve the matter and pay $252 million in u.s. federal income taxes. as a result, interest was charged upon closing of the audit. the amount of interest expense recognized in 2022 was $58 million. as of december 31, 2023, $252 million in u.s. federal income taxes and $58 million in interest expense have been paid as a result of the settlement agreement. the company has now fully satisfied the payment terms of the settlement agreement regarding the 2015 financing entities timber monetization restructuring tax matter. the reversal of the company's remaining deferred tax liability associated with the 2015 financing entities of $604 million was recognized as a one-time tax benefit in the third quarter of 2022.
liquidity and capital resources outlook for 2024
we intend to continue making choices for the use of cash that are consistent with our capital allocation framework to drive long-term value creation. these include maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit rating, returning meaningful cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and making organic investments to maintain our world-class system and strengthen our businesses.
on october 11, 2022, our board of directors approved an additional $1.5 billion under our share repurchase program. this program does not have an expiration date and has approximately $2.96 billion aggregate amount of shares of common stock remaining authorized for purchase as of december 31, 2023. we may continue to repurchase shares under such authorization in open market transactions (including block trades), privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, applicable securities laws requirements and other factors. in addition, we have paid regular quarterly cash dividends and expect to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends in the foreseeable future. each quarterly dividend is subject to review and approval by our board of directors.
capital expenditures and long-term debt capital spending for 2024 is planned at approximately $800 million to $1.0 billion, or about 78% to 97% of depreciation and amortization.
at december 31, 2023, international paper's credit agreements totaled $1.9 billion, which is comprised of the $1.4 billion contractually committed bank credit agreement and up to $500 million under the receivables securitization program. in june 2023, the company amended and restated its credit agreement to, among other things (i) reduce the size of the contractually committed bank facility from $1.5 billion to $1.4 billion, (ii) extend the maturity date from june 2026 to june 2028, and (iii) replace the libor-based rate with a sofr-based rate. management believes these credit agreements are adequate to cover expected operating cash flow variability during the current economic cycle. the credit agreements generally provide for interest rates at a floating rate index plus a pre-determined margin dependent upon international paper's credit rating. at december 31, 2023, the company had no borrowings outstanding under the $1.4 billion credit agreement or the $500 million receivables securitization program. the company's credit agreements are not subject to any restrictive covenants other than the financial covenants as disclosed on pages 80 and 81 in note 16 - debt and lines of credit of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, and the borrowings under the receivables securitization program being limited by eligible receivables. the company was in compliance with all its debt covenants at december 31, 2023 and was well below the thresholds stipulated under the covenants as defined in the credit agreements. further the financial covenants do not restrict any borrowings under the credit agreements.
in addition to the $1.9 billion capacity under the company's credit agreements, international paper has a commercial paper program with a borrowing capacity of $1.0 billion supported by its $1.4 billion credit agreement. under the terms of the company's commercial paper program, individual maturities on borrowings may vary, but not exceed one year from the date of issue. interest bearing notes may be issued either as fixed or floating rate notes. the company had no borrowings outstanding as of december 31, 2023, and $410 million outstanding as of december 31, 2022, under this program.
during the first quarter of 2023, the company entered into a variable term loan agreement providing for a $600 million term loan which was fully drawn on the date of such loan agreement and matures in 2028. the $600 million debt was issued following the repayment of $410 million of commercial paper earlier in 2023. additionally, during the first quarter of 2023, the company issued an approximately $72 million environmental development bond ("edb") with an interest rate of 4.00% and a maturity date of april 1, 2026. the proceeds from this issuance were used to repay an approximately $72 million outstanding edb that matured on april 1, 2023.
during the second quarter of 2023, the company issued approximately $24 million of debt with a variable interest rate and a maturity date of december 1, 2027. the company had debt reductions of approximately $49 million of variable interest edbs with current maturities. additionally, during the second quarter of 2023, the company issued an approximately $54 million edb with a variable rate and a maturity date of may 1, 2028. the proceeds of this were used to repay an approximately $54 million edb that matured on may 1, 2023. the company issued an approximately $25 million edb with a variable rate and a maturity date of june 1, 2030. the proceeds of this were used to repay an approximately $25 million edb that matured on june 1, 2023.
during the third quarter of 2023, the company repaid an approximately $70 million edb with an interest rate of 2.90% that matured on september 1, 2023.
during the fourth quarter of 2023, the company repaid an approximately $87 million note with an interest rate of 6.875% that matured on november 1, 2023. additionally, the company issued approximately $11 million of debt with a variable interest rate and a maturity date of december 1, 2027.
for additional information regarding the company's credit agreements and outstanding indebtedness, see note 16 debt and lines of credit on pages 80 and 81 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
international paper expects to be able to meet projected capital expenditures, service existing debt, meet working capital and dividend requirements and make common stock and/or debt repurchases for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter with current cash balances and cash from operations, supplemented as required by its existing credit facilities. the company will continue to rely on debt and capital markets for the majority of any necessary long-term funding not provided by operating cash flows. funding decisions will be guided by our capital structure planning objectives. the primary goals of the company's capital structure planning are to maximize financial flexibility and maintain appropriate levels of liquidity to meet our needs while managing balance sheet debt and interest expense. we have repurchased, and may continue to repurchase, our common stock (under our existing share repurchase program) and debt (including through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise) to the extent consistent with this capital structure planning, and subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, applicable securities laws requirements and other factors. the majority of international paper's debt is accessed through global public capital markets where we have a wide base of investors.
maintaining an investment grade credit rating is an important element of international paper's financing strategy. at december 31, 2023, the company held long-term credit ratings of bbb (stable outlook) and baa2 (stable outlook) by s&p and moody's, respectively.
contractual obligations for future payments under existing debt and lease commitments and purchase obligations at december 31, 2023, were as follows:

(a)includes financing lease obligations.
(b)includes $3.8 billion relating to fiber supply agreements.
(c)not included in the above table due to the uncertainty of the amount and timing of the payment are unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $168 million. also not included in the above table is $84 million of deemed repatriation transition tax associated with the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act which will be settled from 2024 - 2026. additionally, the deferred tax liability of $485 million related to the temple-inland timber monetization is not included in the table above. it will be settled with the maturity of the notes in 2027.
we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31, 2023, to be permanently reinvested and, accordingly, no u.s. income taxes have been provided thereon (see note 13 income taxes on pages 72 through 74 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data). we do not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the united states to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements.
pension obligations and funding at december 31, 2023, the projected benefit obligation for the company's u.s. defined benefit plans determined under u.s. gaap was approximately $146 million higher than the fair value of plan assets, excluding non-u.s. plans. plans that are subject to minimum funding requirements had plan assets of $118 million higher than the projected benefit obligation. under current irs funding rules, the calculation of minimum funding requirements differs from the calculation of the present value of plan benefits (the "projected benefit obligation") for accounting purposes. funding contributions depend on the funding methods selected by the company. the selected methods allow for the smoothing of asset values and interest rates used to measure the funding obligations. the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and elected not to make any voluntary contributions in 2021, 2022 or 2023. at this time, we do not expect to have any required contributions to our plans in 2024, although the company may elect to make future voluntary contributions. the timing and amount of future contributions, which could be material, will depend on a number of factors, including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates.
critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires international paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. some of these estimates require subjective judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain.
accounting policies whose application has had or is reasonably likely to have a material impact on the reported results of operations and financial position of international paper, and that can require a significant level of estimation or uncertainty by management that affect their application, include the accounting for contingencies, impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and goodwill, pensions and income taxes. management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of significant estimates with the audit and finance committee of the company's board of directors and with its independent registered public accounting firm.
contingent liabilities accruals for contingent liabilities, including personal injury, product liability, environmental, asbestos and other legal matters, are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical litigation and settlement experience and recommendations of legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs. the company estimated the probable liability associated with environmental matters to be approximately $251 million and $243 million in the aggregate as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. liabilities for asbestos-related matters require reviews of recent and historical claims data. the company's total recorded liability with respect to pending and future asbestos-related claims was $97 million and $105 million, net of estimated insurance recoveries, as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. the company utilizes its in-house legal counsel and environmental experts to develop estimates of its legal, environmental and asbestos obligations, supplemented as needed by third-party specialists to analyze its most complex contingent liabilities.
impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. a recoverability test is performed by comparing the undiscounted cash flows to carrying value of the assets. if the carrying amount is less than the undiscounted cash flows, the fair value of the assets is compared to the carrying value to determine if they are impaired. an impairment of a long-lived asset exists when the asset's carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
we perform an annual goodwill impairment as of october 1. additionally, interim assessments of possible impairments of goodwill are also made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations. a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value.
the amount and timing of goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges based on these assessments requires the estimation of future cash flows or the fair market value of the related assets based on management's best estimates of certain key factors, including future selling prices and volumes, operating, raw material, energy and freight costs, various other projected operating economic factors and other intended uses of the assets.
asu 2011-08, "intangibles - goodwill and other," allows entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. if a qualitative assessment is performed, an entity is not required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test unless the entity determines that, based on that qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying value.
the north america industrial packaging reporting unit is the company's only reporting unit with goodwill. as of october 1, 2023, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit through a quantitative goodwill impairment test. for the 2023 quantitative assessment, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was calculated using a weighted approach based on discounted future cash flows, market multiples and transaction multiples. the determination of fair value using the discounted cash flow approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenues, operating profit margins, and discount rates. the determination of fair value using market multiples and transaction multiples requires management to make significant assumptions related to revenue multiples and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("ebitda") multiples. the results of our quantitative goodwill impairment test indicated that the carrying amount did not exceed the estimated fair value of the north america industrial packaging reporting unit.
pension benefit obligations the calculation of the pension benefit obligation and corresponding expense amounts are determined annually, with involvement of international paper's consulting actuary, and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates, projected future compensation increases and mortality rates.
the calculations of pension benefit obligations and expense require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities.
benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of december 31, 2023, for international paper's pension plan were as follows:
in millions                              benefit   fair value of obligation   plan assets u.s. qualified pension              $8,718         $8,836
u.s. nonqualified pension              264         -
non-u.s. pension                        58                  20
the table below shows the discount rate used by international paper to calculate u.s. pension obligations for the years shown:
2023                                      2022          2021
discount rate           5.10   %      5.40   %      2.90   %
international paper determines these actuarial assumptions, after consultation with our actuaries, on december 31 each year or more frequently if required, to calculate liability information as of that date and pension expense for the following year. the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current asset classes in the plan's investment portfolio. the discount rate assumption was determined based on a hypothetical settlement portfolio selected from a universe of high-quality corporate bonds.
the expected long-term rate of return on u.s. pension plan assets used to determine net periodic cost for the year ended december 31, 2023 was 6.50%.
increasing the expected long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets by an additional 0.25% would decrease 2024 pension expense by approximately $21 million, while a (decrease) increase of 0.25% in the discount rate would (increase) decrease pension expense by approximately $12 million.
actual rates of return earned on u.s. pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were:
year           return        year         return
2023         7.3    %        2018     (3.0)    %
2022      (22.0)    %        2017      19.3    %
2021         7.7    %        2016       7.1    %
2020        24.7    %        2015       1.3    %
2019        23.9    %        2014       6.4    %
asc 715, "compensation - retirement benefits," provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses, including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate, differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets, and other assumption changes. these net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years.
net periodic pension plan expenses, calculated for all of international paper's plans, were as follows:
in millions                           2023   2022            2021                 2020        2019
pension (income) expense u.s. plans                         $94       $(116)          $(112)            $32         $93
non-u.s. plans                       5               5               4           5           6
net (income) expense               $99       $(111)          $(108)            $37         $99
the increase in 2023 pension expense primarily reflects higher interest cost and lower expected return on assets, offset by lower service cost.
assuming that discount rates, expected long-term returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as of december 31, 2023, projected future net periodic pension plan expense (income) would be as follows:
in millions                      2025          2024
pension expense (income)
u.s. plans                       $(43)         $(7)
non-u.s. plans                   5                   5
net (income) expense             $(38)         $(2)
the company estimates that it will record net pension income of approximately $7 million for its u.s. defined benefit plans in 2024, compared to expense of $94 million in 2023.
the market value of plan assets for international paper's u.s. qualified pension plan at december 31, 2023 totaled approximately $8.8 billion, consisting of approximately 66% hedging assets and 34% return seeking assets. the company's funding policy for its qualified pension plan is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements, plus any additional amounts that the company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plan, tax deductibility, the cash flows generated by the company, and other factors. the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and could elect to make voluntary contributions in the future. there were no required contributions to the u.s. qualified plan in 2023. the nonqualified defined benefit plans are funded to the extent of benefit payments, which totaled $22 million for the year ended december 31, 2023.
income taxes international paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates. where the company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in its income tax returns. where treatment of a position is uncertain, liabilities are recorded based upon the company's evaluation of the "more likely than not" outcome considering technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter. changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome, such as settlement with the relevant tax authority, the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year, change in tax laws, or recent court cases that are relevant to the matter. accrued interest related to these uncertain tax positions is recorded in our consolidated statement of operations in interest expense, net.
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. significant judgment is required in assessing the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. this assessment is completed by tax jurisdiction and relies on both positive and negative evidence available, with significant weight placed on recent financial results. cumulative reported pre-tax income is considered objectively verifiable positive evidence of our ability to generate positive pre-tax income in the future. in accordance with gaap, when there is a recent history of pre-tax losses, there is little or no weight placed on forecasts for purposes of assessing the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. when necessary, we use systematic and logical methods to estimate when deferred tax liabilities will reverse and generate taxable income and when deferred tax assets will reverse and generate tax deductions. assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are required when scheduling the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the exercise is inherently complex and subjective. the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. the company's valuation allowance was $848 million and $677 million at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
while international paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances, actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts.
legal proceedings information concerning the company's environmental and other legal proceedings is set forth in note 14 commitments and contingent liabilities on pages 74 through 78 of item  8. financial statements and supplementary data. the company is not subject to any administrative or judicial proceeding arising under any federal, state or local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment that is likely to result in monetary sanctions of $1 million or more.
recent accounting developments see note 2 recent accounting developments on page 60 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.
effect of inflation inflationary increases in certain input costs, such as energy, wood, recycled fiber, freight and chemical costs, had an adverse impact on the company's operating results in 2023 and 2022. the effects of inflation have been more significant in recent years due to general inflationary conditions, including labor market conditions, economic activity, consumer behavior, supply shortages and disruptions. sales prices and volumes are primarily influenced by economic supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations but are also currently being impacted by the current inflationary environment.
foreign currency effects international paper has operations in a number of countries. its operations in those countries also export to, and compete with imports from other regions. as such, currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the company's financial statements. direct impacts include the translation of international operations' local currency financial statements into u.s. dollars and the remeasurement impact associated with non-functional currency financial assets and liabilities. indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into, and exports out of, the united states (and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally). in general, a weaker u.s. dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to international paper. the currency that has the most impact is the euro.
market risk we use financial instruments, including fixed and variable rate debt, to finance operations, for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes. additionally, financial instruments, including various derivative contracts, are used to hedge exposures to interest rate, commodity and foreign currency risks. we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes. information related to international paper's debt obligations is included in note 16 debt and lines of credit on pages 80 and 81 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
the fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments. we assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis. the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings, fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10% change (increase and decrease) in interest and currency rates and commodity prices.
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short- and long-term debt obligations and investments in marketable securities. we invest in investment-grade securities of financial institutions and money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of aaa and limit exposure to any one issuer or fund. our investments in marketable securities at december 31, 2023 and 2022 are stated at cost, which approximates market due to their short-term nature. our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was not material.
we issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion that management deems appropriate based on current and projected market conditions. derivative instruments, such as interest rate swaps, may be used to execute this strategy. at december 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of the net liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately $4.5 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. the potential increase in fair value resulting from a 10% adverse shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately $273 million and $328 million at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
commodity price risk the objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities. commodity swap or forward purchase contracts may be used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices. at december 31, 2023 and 2022, the net fair value of these contracts was $27 million asset and $20 million asset. the potential loss in fair value from a 10% adverse change in quoted commodity prices for these contracts would have been approximately $4 million and $3 million at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
foreign currency risk international paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries. the currency that has the most impact is the euro. our objective in managing the associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our after-tax cash flows. we address these risks on a limited basis by entering into cross-currency interest rate swaps, or foreign exchange contracts.
at december 31, 2023 and 2022, the net fair value of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was immaterial. the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates was also immaterial.

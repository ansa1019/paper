financial risks fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in our financial performance and in the trading prices of our common stock. extended material declines in the market prices of such commodities could adversely affect our financial condition and operating plans.
our financial results are significantly influenced by and vary with fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce, primarily copper and gold, and to a lesser extent molybdenum. extended material declines in market prices of such commodities could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and the value of our assets, may depress the price of our common stock, and may have a material adverse effect on our ability to comply with financial and other covenants in our debt agreements, service our debt and meet our other obligations. for additional information regarding recent macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, see risk factor below regarding the price and availability of consumables and components we purchase and constraints on supply and logistics, and transportation services.
there has been a history of significant volatility in the commodities markets, including the copper market. fluctuations in commodities prices are caused by varied and complex factors beyond our control, including global supply and demand and inventory levels; global economic and political conditions (such as level of economic growth or recession and political or geopolitical conflicts); international regulatory, trade and/or tax policies, including national tariffs; commodities investment activity and speculation; interest rates; expectations regarding future inflation rates; the strength of the u.s. dollar compared to foreign currencies; the price and availability of substitute products; and changes in technology. volatility in global economic growth, particularly in developing economies, has the potential to affect adversely future demand and prices for commodities. geopolitical uncertainty and protectionism have the potential to inhibit international trade and negatively impact business confidence, which creates the risk of constraints on our ability to trade in certain markets and has the potential to increase price volatility. for additional information regarding the historical fluctuations of the prices of copper, gold and molybdenum, refer to "markets" in md&a.
in addition to the factors discussed above, copper prices may be affected by demand from china, which is currently the largest consumer of refined copper in the world, including as a result of geopolitical uncertainty between the u.s. and china as well as uncertainties about china's economy. the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies are difficult to predict and could adversely affect copper prices, demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers and the u.s. economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. copper prices also may be affected by the construction industry, the markets for automobiles and appliances, the global focus on a transition to new technologies for clean energy, advancement in communications and enhanced public health, and inadequate investment in and limited production from copper mining operations in south america, as well as demand from north america, europe, and asian countries other than china.
additional factors affecting gold prices may include purchases and sales of gold by governments and central banks, demand from china and india, two of the world's largest consumers of gold, and global demand for jewelry containing gold.
if market prices for the primary commodities we produce were to decline and remain low for a sustained period of time, we may have to revise our operating plans, including curtailing or modifying our mining and processing operations, as we have done in the past, and our cash flows, ability to return capital to shareholders and capital expenditure plans could be negatively affected. we may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues, in which case we may incur losses, and those losses may be material.
declines in prices of commodities we sell could also result in metals inventory adjustments and impairment charges for our long-lived assets.
fluctuations in the price and availability of consumables and components for key machines and equipment we purchase, and constraints on supply and logistics could affect our profitability and operating plans. further, significant delays or increases in costs affecting transportation services may affect our business.
consumables and components for key machines and equipment we purchase are subject to price volatility caused by global economic factors that are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, wage pressures, inflation and economic slowdown or recession, as well as fuel and energy costs (for example, the price of diesel), the impact of natural disasters, major public health crises, geopolitical conflicts, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and other matters that have or could impact the global economy.
prices of consumables used in our operations, such as natural gas, diesel, coal, other sources of energy, ammonium nitrate, chemical reagents (including sulfuric acid), and steel-related products, and components impact the costs of production at our operations and the costs of development projects. these prices fluctuate and can be volatile. since 2022, we have experienced price increases on, and volatility in, certain consumables, including diesel fuel, ammonium nitrate and sulfuric acid, and certain components, which has negatively impacted our operating results. we also experienced increased costs for equipment, parts and other operating supplies and services. further increases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could result in material changes to our operating plans or development projects.
ensuring continuity of supply of such consumables to our operations is critical to our business. we also rely on the availability of components from suppliers for key machines and equipment, which may be impacted by competition demands as well as the availability of input materials in the creation of such equipment. a supplier's failure to supply consumables or components in a timely manner or to meet our quality, quantity, cost requirements or our technical specifications, or our inability to obtain alternative sources of consumables or components on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us, could adversely affect our operations. we have also experienced longer lead times on delivery of certain consumables, including fuel, lubricants, ammonium nitrate and acid. while these delays did not significantly impact our results in 2022 or 2023, these delays may continue and could become material. further, delays and logistical constraints may occur as a result of weather-related impacts or violence, civil and religious strife, and activism at or near our operations or those of our suppliers, as described in the related risk factor below.
our business depends on timely inbound transportation of consumables and components we use and outbound transportation of the commodities we produce by truck, rail and ocean freight. any significant increase in the cost of or significant delays in the transportation of consumables or components used in our operations or the commodities we produce, as a result of increases in fuel or labor costs, higher demand for logistics services, weather-related impacts (such as low water levels along shipping routes) or otherwise, could adversely affect our results of operations. additionally, if transportation service providers fail to deliver consumables or components used in our operations to us or the commodities we produce to our customers in a timely manner or at all, such failure could adversely impact our ability to meet our production schedules, delay our projects and capital initiatives, negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.
our debt and other financial commitments may limit our financial and operating flexibility.
at december 31, 2023, our total consolidated debt was $9.4 billion (see md&a and note 8) and our total consolidated cash and cash equivalents was $4.8 billion ($5.8 billion including restricted cash and cash equivalents associated with pt-fi's export proceeds required to be temporarily deposited in indonesia banks, as described in md&a and note 14). we also have various other financial commitments, including reclamation and environmental obligations, take-or-pay contracts and leases. although we have been successful in servicing debt in the past, refinancing our bank facilities and issuing new debt securities in capital markets transactions, there can be no assurance that we can continue to do so. in addition, we (including our subsidiaries) may incur additional debt in future periods or reduce our holdings of cash and cash equivalents in connection with funding existing operations, capital expenditures, dividends, share or debt repurchases, or in pursuing other business opportunities. for further information, see the risk factors below relating to mine closure and reclamation regulations and the increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from stakeholders and other third parties, including creditors, with respect to our esg practices, performance and disclosures.
our level of indebtedness and other financial commitments could have important consequences to our business, including the following:
•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate;
•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic, industry and regulatory conditions;
•limiting our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate requirements and/or material contingencies, to engage in future development activities or other business opportunities, or to otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt;
•requiring us to sell assets to reduce debt; or
•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and/or fewer financial commitments.
any failure to comply with the financial and/or other covenants in our debt agreements may result in an event of default that would allow the creditors to accelerate maturities of the related debt, which in turn may trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in other debt agreements. our available cash and liquidity may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our debt instruments that may be accelerated upon an event of default.
as of january 31, 2024, our senior unsecured debt was rated "baa2" with a stable outlook by moody's investors service, "bbb-" with a positive outlook by fitch ratings, and "bb+" with a positive outlook by standard & poor's. if we are unable to maintain our indebtedness and financial ratios at levels acceptable to these credit rating agencies, or should our business prospects deteriorate, our current credit ratings could be downgraded, which could adversely affect the value of our outstanding securities and existing debt, our ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms and could increase our borrowing costs.
changes in or the failure to comply with the requirements of mine closure and reclamation regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.
we are required by u.s. federal and state laws and regulations to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans for our mining properties if we are unable to do so. as of december 31, 2023, our financial assurance obligations totaled $1.8 billion for closure and reclamation costs of u.s. mining sites. refer to note 12 for additional information regarding our financial assurance obligations and items 1. and 2. "business and properties" for a discussion of certain of such u.s. federal and state laws and regulations applicable to us. a substantial portion of our financial assurance obligations are satisfied by guarantees by us and certain of our subsidiaries. our ability to continue to provide guarantees depends on state and other regulatory requirements, our financial performance and our financial condition. other forms of assurance, such as letters of credit and surety bonds, are costly to provide and, depending on our financial condition and market conditions, may be difficult or impossible to obtain. failure to provide or maintain the required financial assurance could result in the closure of the affected properties.
plans and provisions for mine closure, reclamation and remediation may change over time as a result of changes in stakeholder and other third-party expectations, legislation, standards, and technical understanding and techniques, which may cause our actual costs of closure, reclamation and remediation to be higher than estimated for asset retirement obligations (aros) and environmental obligations and could materially affect our financial position or results of operations. for example, our implementation of the global industry standard for tailings management (the tailings standard) (refer to items 1. and 2. "business and properties" for further discussion) has required changes and could require additional changes to our closure and reclamation plans or modifications to previously completed reclamation actions, although it is uncertain if these changes would result in material capital or operating cost increases. in addition, climate change could lead to changes in the physical risks posed to our operations, which could result in changes in our closure and reclamation plans to address such risks. any modifications to our closure and reclamation plans that may be required to address physical climate risks may increase our financial assurance obligations and may materially increase the actual costs associated with implementing closure and reclamation at any or all of our active or inactive mine sites or smelter sites. refer to notes 1 and 12 for further discussion of our environmental obligations and aros and see the risk factors below relating to the potential physical impacts of climate change and our related obligations as part of our commitment to implementing the tailings standard.
unanticipated litigation or negative developments in pending litigation or other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
we are, and may in the future become, involved in various legal proceedings and subject to other contingencies that have arisen or may arise in the ordinary course of our business or are associated with environmental matters, including those described in note 12, items 1. and 2. "business and properties" and in item 3. "legal proceedings." we are also involved periodically in other reviews, inquiries, investigations and other proceedings initiated by or involving government agencies, some of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. from time to time we are involved in disputes over the allocation of environmental remediation obligations at "superfund" and other sites. in addition, we may be held responsible for the costs of addressing contamination at the site of current or former activities or at third-party sites, or be held liable to third parties for exposure to hazardous substances should those be identified in the future. for further discussion of our environmental obligations, see the regulatory, environmental and social risks below. the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages, penalties, other sanctions or injunctive relief against us, limitations on our property rights, or regulatory interpretations that increase our operating costs, some of which may not be covered by insurance. further, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to our causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcome of any individual legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period.
regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to investigations can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and distracting to management. in recognition of these considerations, we may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. there can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur.
further, we are a global business with operations in various jurisdictions. in the event of a dispute arising at our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels, or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the u.s. or in enforcing the judgment of a foreign court or arbitral panel against a sovereign nation. our inability to enforce our rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels, including against a sovereign nation, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
changes in tax laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
as a global business, we are subject to income, royalty, transaction and other taxes in the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions. uncertainties exist with respect to our tax liabilities, including those arising from changes in laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business. we have significant net operating losses (nols) in the u.s. generated in prior years. these nols are available to offset future regular taxable income, which we believe will result in minimal estimated regular income tax liability in the u.s. over the next several years at current metals market prices. as discussed in md&a and note 11, the provisions of the u.s. inflation reduction act of 2022 (the act) became applicable to us on january 1, 2023. we have made interpretations of certain provisions of the act, and based on these interpretations, determined that the provisions of the act did not materially impact our financial results in 2023. although the u.s. department of the treasury (treasury) published guidance in 2023 that provided some additional clarity on the rules, uncertainty remains regarding the application of the corporate alternative minimum tax. future guidance released by the treasury may differ from our interpretations of the act, which could be material and may further limit our ability to realize future benefits from our u.s. nols.
further, as discussed in md&a, recommendations from the organisation for economic co-operation and development regarding a global minimum income tax and other changes are being considered and/or implemented in jurisdictions where we operate. at current metals market prices, we believe enactment of the recommended framework in jurisdictions where we operate will result in minimal impacts to our financial results in the near term. the impact of any new tax legislation may differ materially from our estimates as a result of future regulatory guidance or changes in our interpretations or assumptions we have made.
international risks our international operations are subject to evolving geopolitical, economic, regulatory and social risks.
we are a u.s.-based mining company with substantial assets located outside of the u.s. risks of conducting business in countries outside the u.s. can include:
•delays in obtaining or renewing, or the inability to obtain, maintain or renew, or the renegotiation, cancellation, revocation or forced modification (including the inherent risk of these actions being taken unilaterally by the foreign government or government owned entities) of contracts, leases, licenses, permits, stability agreements or other agreements and/or approvals;
•expropriation or nationalization of property, protectionism, or restrictions on repatriation of earnings or capital;
•changes in and differing interpretations of the host country's laws, regulations and policies (which may be applied retroactively), including, but not limited to, those relating to labor, taxation, royalties, duties, tariffs, licenses, divestment, imports, exports (including restrictions on the export of copper concentrates and anode slimes, copper and/or gold), trade laws and regulations, immigration, currency, human rights and environmental matters (including land use and water use), additional requirements on foreign operations and investment, and/or fines, fees and sanctions, criminal liability and other penalties imposed for failure to comply with the laws and regulations of the u.s. and the other jurisdictions in which we operate, the risk of any of which may increase with rising "resource nationalism" in countries around the world;
•geopolitical events, social and economic instability, bribery, extortion, corruption, civil unrest, blockades, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism, certain of which may result in, among other things, an inability to access our property or transport our commodities;
•risk of loss associated with illegal activity, including trespass, illegal artisanal mining, theft (including piracy), sabotage (including of critical infrastructure) and vandalism;
•changes in u.s. trade, tariff, tax, immigration or other policies that may impact relations with foreign countries or result in retaliatory policies;
•increases in training and other costs and challenges relating to requirements by governmental entities to employ nationals of a country in which a particular operation is located;
•foreign exchange controls and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;
•reduced protection for intellectual property rights; and
•the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of an international court or arbitration panel or having to enforce the judgment of an international court or arbitration panel against a sovereign nation within its own territory.
accordingly, our activities outside of the u.s. may be substantially affected by many external factors beyond our control, some of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
we are required to comply with a wide range of laws and regulations in the countries where we operate or do business. for example, our international operations must comply with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws of the other jurisdictions in which we operate. we operate in jurisdictions that have experienced public and private sector corruption and where significant anti-corruption enforcement activities, prosecutions and settlements have occurred. we have a large number of contracts with local and foreign business partners, including suppliers and contractors, who may take action contrary to or fail to adopt standards, controls and procedures, including health, safety, environment, human rights and community standards that are equivalent to our standards, controls and procedures. there can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from misinterpretation of or noncompliance with applicable laws and internal policies, recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts committed by our affiliates, employees or business partners. as such, our corporate policies and processes may not prevent or detect all potential breaches of law or governance practices. any breaches could result in safety events that may result in injuries or fatalities; significant criminal or civil fines, penalties, litigation or regulatory action or inquiries or other enforcement actions; shareholder or other stakeholder activism (such as to stop using a certain business partner); civil unrest or other adverse impacts on human rights; termination of contracts; loss of operating licenses or permits; and damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
in addition, our insurance does not cover most losses caused by the risks described above. for example, we do not have political risk insurance.
we conduct international mining operations and exploration activities in indonesia, peru and chile as well as other foreign jurisdictions. accordingly, in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in countries outside the u.s., our business may be adversely affected by political, economic, social and regional uncertainties in each of these countries. for example, we are involved in several significant tax proceedings and other tax disputes with indonesia and peru tax authorities (refer to note 12 for further discussion of these matters). other risks specific to certain countries in which we operate are discussed in more detail below.
because our mining operations in indonesia are a significant operating asset, our business may be adversely affected by political, economic, regulatory and social uncertainties in indonesia.
maintaining a good working relationship with the indonesia government, pt mineral industri indonesia (mind id), an indonesia state-owned enterprise and shareholder in pt-fi, and the local population, is important because of the significance of our indonesia operations to our business, and because our mining operations there are among indonesia's most significant business enterprises. partially because of the grasberg minerals district's significance to indonesia's economy, the environmentally sensitive area where it is located, and the number of local people employed, our indonesia operations have been the subject of political debates and criticism in the indonesia press, and have been the target of protests and occasional violence. improper management of our working relationship with the indonesia government, mind id or the local population could lead to a disruption of operations and/or impact our reputation in indonesia and in the region where we operate, which could adversely affect our business.
the mining industry is subject to extensive regulation within indonesia, and there have been major developments in laws and regulations applicable to mining concession holders, some of which have conflicted with pt-fi's contractual rights and may conflict with pt-fi's contractual rights in the future.
the enactment of law no. 4 of 2009 on coal and mineral mining on january 12, 2009 (the mining law) replaced the previous regulatory framework which allowed concession holders, including pt-fi, to conduct mining activities in indonesia under a contract of work system. notwithstanding provisions in pt-fi's former contract of work (cow) prohibiting it from doing so, the indonesia government sought to modify pt-fi's former cow to address provisions contained in the mining law and implementing regulations adopted thereunder, some of which were not required under or conflicted with pt-fi's former cow. in addition, in early 2017, the indonesia government issued new regulations to address exports of unrefined metals, including copper concentrates and anode slimes, and other matters related to the mining sector. on december 21, 2018, pt-fi was granted an iupk to replace its former cow, enabling pt-fi to conduct operations in the grasberg minerals district through 2041, subject to certain requirements. refer to note 13 for a summary of the iupk's key fiscal terms and requirement to develop additional smelting and refining capacity.
since 2019, the indonesia government has enacted various laws and regulations related to downstream processing of various products. refer to "operations - indonesia mining" in md&a and notes 12, 13 and 14 for a discussion of indonesia regulatory matters, including those related to export licenses, export duties, export proceeds, smelter assurance bonds and smelter development progress, including assessing administrative fines. in 2023, pt-fi was granted export licenses for copper concentrates and anode slimes, both of which are valid through may 2024. pt-fi has requested approvals to continue exports of copper concentrates and anode slimes beyond may 2024 and until the manyar smelter and precious metals refinery (pmr) in indonesia (collectively, the indonesia smelter projects) are fully commissioned and reach designed operating conditions. we cannot predict if pt-fi will be able to obtain approval timely or at all to continue exports beyond may 2024, including of sufficient volumes of copper concentrates and anode slimes. if any limitations on exports or additional financial impacts resulting from indonesia regulations were to be assessed prior to pt-fi's indonesia smelter projects becoming operational later in 2024, pt-fi would be required to reduce production levels or be subject to additional costs, which could adversely impact our revenues and operations.
further, pt-fi continues to discuss the applicability of the revised regulation for export duties with the indonesia government because of inconsistencies with its iupk. if pt-fi is unable to successfully dispute the export duties, it may be unable to recover the assessed duties and would be required to continue paying such duties until the manyar smelter construction is completed and operational.
there can be no assurance that future regulatory changes affecting the mining industry in indonesia will not be introduced or unexpectedly repealed, or that new interpretations of existing laws and regulations will not be issued, any of which may conflict with pt-fi's contractual rights, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
beginning in 2022, the indonesia government divided the indonesia portion of the island of new guinea from two provinces into a total of six provinces, which has resulted in public protest and civil unrest. for further discussion of violence, civil and religious strife, and activism affecting our operations in indonesia, see the related risk factor below. further, we cannot predict the impact of splitting provinces on local and regional regulations, permits and other governmental administrative functions, which could have an adverse impact on our business.
in 2024, indonesia is holding national legislative elections, including the presidential election. political considerations leading up to and resulting from these elections could affect, among other things, national and local policies pertaining to foreign investment, permitting and export restrictions, which could adversely affect our indonesia mining operations.
pt-fi will not mine all of the ore reserves in the grasberg minerals district before the initial term of its iupk expires in 2031. pt-fi's iupk may not be extended through 2041 if pt-fi fails to abide by its terms and conditions and applicable laws and regulations.
under the terms of pt-fi's iupk, pt-fi has been granted mining rights through 2031, with rights to extend its mining rights through 2041, subject to, among other things, pt-fi's completion of construction of additional domestic smelting and refining capacity. refer to note 13 for a summary of the iupk's key fiscal terms and development of additional smelting and refining capacity.
our proven and probable mineral reserves in indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041, and pt-fi's current long-term mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that pt-fi will abide by the terms and conditions of the iupk and will be granted the 10-year extension from 2031 through 2041. as a result, pt-fi will not mine all of these mineral reserves during the initial term of the iupk. prior to the end of 2031, we expect to mine 43% of aggregate proven and probable recoverable mineral reserves at december 31, 2023, representing approximately half of our net equity share of recoverable copper and gold reserves.
if pt-fi does not complete the construction of additional domestic smelting and refining capacity, or fulfill its defined fiscal obligations to the indonesia government as set forth in the iupk, the iupk may not be extended from 2031 through 2041, and pt-fi would be unable to mine all of its proven and probable mineral reserves in the grasberg minerals district, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.
pt-fi and the indonesia government continue to engage in discussions regarding the extension of pt-fi's iupk beyond 2041. given the long-term nature of planning for mining investments, the indonesia government is updating regulations that would enable pt-fi to apply for an extension of its iupk beyond 2041. we cannot predict whether the regulations will be updated or that pt-fi will be successful in applying for the extension of its iupk beyond 2041.
operational risks our mining operations are subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our business, including the ability to smelt and refine, and our underground mining operations have higher risks than a surface mine.
we have assets in a variety of geographic locations, all of which exist in and around broader communities and environments. maintaining the operational integrity and performance of our assets is crucial to protect our people, the environment and communities in which we operate. our mines are very large in scale and, by their nature are subject to significant operational risks, some of which are outside of our control, and many of which are not covered fully, or in some cases even partially, by insurance. these operational risks, which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and cash flows, include earthquakes, rainstorms, floods, wildfires and other natural disasters; environmental hazards, including discharge of metals, concentrates, pollutants or hazardous chemicals; surface or underground fires; equipment failures; accidents, including in connection with mining equipment, milling equipment or conveyor systems, transportation of chemicals, explosives or other materials and in the transportation of employees and other individuals to and from sites (including where these services are provided by third parties such as vehicle and aircraft transport); wall failures and rock slides in our open-pit mines, and structural collapses of our underground mines or tailings impoundments; underground water and ore management; lower than expected ore grades or recovery rates; and seismic activity resulting from unexpected or difficult geological formations or conditions (whether in mineral or gaseous form).
for a discussion of risks specific to our tailings management, see the risk factors below relating to our management of waste rock and tailings, including our river transport system for tailings management in indonesia.
we are facing continued geotechnical challenges because of the older age of some of our open-pit mines and a trend toward mining deeper pits and more complex deposits. there can be no assurance that unanticipated geotechnical and hydrological conditions may not occur, nor whether these conditions may lead to events such as landslides and pit wall failures, or that such events will be detected in advance. geotechnical instabilities can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control, such as seismic activity or severe weather, which may lead to floods, mudslides, pit-wall instability and possibly even slippage of material. for example, in late 2022, significant rainfall events impacted production at morenci. further, in early 2019, our el abra operation experienced heavy rainfall and electrical storms. as a result, our operating results for 2019 were impacted by a suspension of el abra's crushed leach stacking operations for approximately 35 days. we also experience mining induced seismic activity, including landslides, from time to time in the grasberg minerals district in addition to severe weather. the mine site is in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time. in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry, our indonesia mining operations involve additional risks given their location in steep mountainous terrain in a remote area of indonesia. these conditions have required us to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities. the area also receives extreme rainfall, which has led to periodic floods and mudslides. in february 2023, pt-fi's operations were temporarily disrupted because of significant rainfall and landslides, which restricted access to infrastructure near its milling operations. we cannot predict whether similar weather-related or seismic events will occur in the future or the extent to which any such event would affect these, or any of our other operations.
our business is dependent upon our workforce being able to safely perform their jobs. the occurrence of one or more of these events in connection with our exploration activities and development of and production from mining operations may result in the death of, or personal injury or illness to, our employees, other personnel or third parties, the loss of mining equipment, damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production facilities, significant repair costs, monetary losses, deferral or unanticipated fluctuations in production, extensive community disruption (including short- and long-term health and safety risks), loss of licenses, permits or necessary approvals to operate, loss of workforce confidence, loss of infrastructure and services, disruption to essential supplies or delivery of our products, environmental damage and potential legal liabilities, any of which may adversely affect our reputation, business, prospects, results of operations and financial position. further, the impacts of any serious incidents that occur may also be amplified if we fail to respond timely or in an appropriate manner. underground mining operations have unique risks that can be particularly dangerous, such as those associated with supporting the underground openings. in may 2013, the rock structure above the ceiling of an underground training facility at the grasberg minerals district collapsed, which resulted in 28 fatalities and 10 injuries. while we have implemented preventative measures, we cannot guarantee that any incidents will not occur in the future.
in addition, we could also be subject to operational risks at our smelters and refineries once pt-fi is fully dependent on its ability to smelt and refine domestically all its concentrates and slimes produced by its mining operations at the pt smelting and the indonesia smelter projects. any delay, loss of access or limited availability and capacity related to these smelting and refinery facilities, including equipment failures, unanticipated or extended shutdowns, inability to sell certain by-products, lack of capacity to store certain by-products, severe weather, social or political unrest or any major public health crisis, any of which may not be recognized by the indonesia government as a force majeure event, may significantly impact our ability to export and sell our copper and gold products, even if alternative refineries or smelters outside of indonesia are available, and could adversely impact our revenues and results of operations.
we maintain insurance at amounts we believe to be reasonable to cover some of these risks and hazards; however, our insurance may not sufficiently cover losses from certain of these risks and hazards. there can be no assurance that such insurance will continue to be available, maintained or available at economically feasible premiums, that the proceeds of such insurance will be paid in a timely manner or that we will be adequately compensated for losses actually incurred, if at all. we may elect to not purchase insurance for certain risks because of the high premium costs associated with insuring such risk or for various other reasons. we do not have coverage for certain environmental losses and other risks, including the legal liabilities associated with these risks. the lack of, or insufficiency of, insurance coverage could adversely affect our cash flows and overall profitability.
our management of waste rock and tailings are subject to significant environmental, safety and engineering challenges and risks that could adversely affect our business.
the waste rock (including overburden) and tailings produced in our mining operations represent our largest volume of mine waste material. managing the volume of waste rock and tailings presents significant environmental, safety and engineering challenges and risks primarily relating to structural stability, geochemistry, water quality and dust generation. management of this waste is regulated in the jurisdictions where we operate and our programs are designed to comply with applicable national, state and local laws, permits and approved environmental impact studies.
we maintain large leach pads and tailings impoundments containing viscous material. tailings impoundments include large embankments that must be engineered, constructed and monitored to ensure structural stability and avoid structural collapse. our tailings impoundments in arid areas must have effective programs to suppress fugitive dust emissions to meet regulatory requirements, which vary depending on location, and to limit potential impacts of dust emissions from our operations on surrounding communities and the environment. additionally, we must effectively monitor, prevent and treat acid rock drainage at all of our operations. in indonesia, we use a river transport system for tailings management, which presents other risks discussed in more detail in the risk factor below relating to the environmental challenges at our indonesia mining operations.
as of january 31, 2024, subsidiaries of our company currently operate 15 active tailings storage facilities (13 in the u.s. and 2 in peru), of which 10 have an upstream design and 5 have a centerline design. we also manage 35 tailings storage facilities in the u.s. that are inactive or closed (31 with an upstream design, 2 with a centerline design and 2 with a downstream design) and another 22 that are deemed "safely closed" according to the definition in the tailings standard (19 with an upstream design and 3 with a centerline design). in 2023, we produced approximately 341 million metric tons of tailings, including tailings produced by pt-fi. the failure of tailings storage facilities and other embankments at any of our mining operations could cause severe, and in some cases catastrophic, property and environmental damage and loss of life, as well as adverse effects on our business and reputation. some of our tailings storage facilities are located in areas where a failure has the potential to impact individual dwellings and a limited number of our impoundments are in areas where a failure has the potential to impact nearby communities or mining infrastructure. there can be no assurance that a severe or catastrophic failure of any of our facilities will not occur in the future. for additional information regarding the company's tailings management and stewardship program, including our tailings management system, which incorporates the requirements of the tailings standard, refer to items 1. and 2. "business and properties."
based on observations from tailings failures at unaffiliated mines and our risk assessment process, which assesses a range of potential risks to our tailings storage facilities, in addition to fatalities and severe personal, property and environmental damages, these events could result in limited or restricted access to mine sites, suspension of operations, decrease in mineral reserves, legal liability, government investigations, additional regulations and restrictions on mining operations in response to any such failure, increased monitoring costs and production costs, increased insurance costs or costs associated with insufficiency of or inability to obtain insurance, increased costs and/or limited access to capital, remediation costs, inability to comply with any additional safety requirements or obtain necessary certifications, evacuation or relocation of communities or other emergency action, and other impacts, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.
our indonesia mining operations are susceptible to difficult and costly environmental challenges, and future changes in indonesia environmental laws could increase our costs.
mining operations on the scale of our indonesia operations involve significant environmental risks and challenges. our primary challenge is to dispose of the large volume of tailings. in 2023, pt-fi produced approximately 69 million metric tons of tailings. our tailings management plan, which has been approved by the indonesia government, uses an unnavigable river in the highlands to transport the tailings from the mill to an engineered tailings management area in the lowlands. levees have been constructed along both sides of the lowlands tailings management area to act as containment structures to laterally contain the footprint of the tailings deposition within the approved tailings management area.
another major environmental challenge at pt-fi is managing overburden, which is rock that was required to be moved aside in the open pit mining process to reach the ore in the grasberg open pit. in the presence of air, water and naturally occurring bacteria, some overburden can generate acid rock drainage, or acidic water containing dissolved metals that, if not properly managed, can adversely affect the environment. in addition, the grasberg overburden stockpiles experienced erosion over time, caused by the large amounts of rainfall, with the eroded stockpile material eventually entering into the lowlands tailings management area. this eroded overburden affects the volume as well as the physical and chemical characteristics of the sediment material deposited in the lowlands tailings management area, which can, if not properly managed, result in environmental impacts. the underlying overburden erosion and run-off are being managed and controlled through an extensive re-sloping and water management project, and pt-fi has not experienced similar erosion issues since 2018. however, pt-fi continues to monitor for potential impacts resulting from past erosion or the possibility of erosion recurrence.
pt-fi's current tailings deposition management plan and environmental monitoring program consider the presence of this overburden in the lowlands tailings management area. pt-fi has expanded the scope of its ongoing management and monitoring, which assesses possible impacts to the environment and human health from overburden erosion and tailings. during 2023, pt-fi continued its routine assessments of surface waters, groundwaters, sediments and soils, dust and terrestrial and aquatic tissues. as part of the expanded scope, in 2022
and 2023, pt-fi also assisted the mimika local health authority with an extensive regency-wide community health survey, which provided further data on a broad range of community health issues. the local health authority then prioritized those items having the greatest expected impact on public health. there were no impacts attributable to pt-fi's operations (inclusive of tailings and overburden erosion) that were determined to be a priority focus following the results of the local health authority's assessment. in response to the health survey results, pt-fi and the local health authority have agreed to collaborate on public health challenges. future testing and community health surveys may be used to assess the effectiveness of the local health authority's priority programs and educational efforts.
in the past, the indonesia government, stakeholders and other third parties have raised questions with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans, including a suggestion that we implement a tailings pipeline and dam rather than the river transport system for tailings management. our indonesia mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area, which also experiences extreme weather events; such that, the pipeline infrastructure required to convey the volume of material is not feasible. based on our own studies and others conducted by third parties, we believe that our controlled riverine transport system is the best site-specific option for tailings management at the grasberg minerals district.
overtopping or failure of any of the pt-fi tailings containment structures (levees or protection structures) induced by extreme weather events such as floods, a major seismic event or naturally-occurring weak ground under the structures, are potential risks. the potential impacts from any such occurrence could vary significantly depending upon the specific location of the failure. unanticipated structural failure of these structures in certain areas in the future could result in flooding of the nearby communities and related loss of lives and/or severe personal, property and environmental damages. under certain conditions, a failure may necessitate evacuation or relocation of communities or other emergency action, financial assistance to the communities impacted, and remediation costs to repair and compensate for the social, cultural and economic impacts associated with such failure.
in addition, in the southern (estuary) portion of the approved tailings management area, mathematical modeling of certain sediment transport scenarios indicate tailings have the potential to be deposited outside of the approved lateral levees in adjacent mangroves. pt-fi has proposed additional extensions to the existing levees to the indonesia regulators and is further evaluating the potential benefits and impacts. indonesia regulators have further proposed a different strategy involving efforts to increase sediment retention through various methods as well as increase beneficial use of tailings. if the additional retention efforts are not successful, or if the permitting for these proposed protection structures is not reconsidered, any such depositional impacts outside of our existing approved footprint could impact the environment and communities. refer to items 1. and 2. "business and properties" for further discussion of our environmental obligations in indonesia.
managing these environmental challenges at our indonesia operations could result in reputational harm and increased costs that could be significant.
there can be no assurance that future environmental changes affecting the mining industry in indonesia will not be introduced or unexpectedly altered or repealed, or that new interpretations of existing indonesia environmental laws and regulations will not be issued, which could have a significant impact on pt-fi.
violence, civil and religious strife, and activism could result in loss of life and disrupt our operations.
indonesia indonesia has long faced separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces. several separatist groups have sought increased political independence for the province of central papua, where our grasberg minerals district is located. in central papua, there have been attacks on civilians by separatists and conflicts between separatists and the indonesia military and police. in addition, illegal artisanal miners have clashed with police who have attempted to move them away from our facilities. social, economic and political instability in central papua could materially adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our indonesia operations.
shooting incidents have occurred within the pt-fi project area, including along the road leading to our mining and milling operations, which in some instances have involved fatalities or injuries to our employees, contractor employees, government security personnel and civilians. we incurred no fatalities or injuries relating to shootings within the pt-fi project area since april 2020, and we have had no shootings associated with the pt-fi project area since january 2021. during the first half of 2020, there were several shooting incidents, including an incident near a pt-fi office building where one employee was killed and two others injured. in january 2021, a helicopter contracted by pt-fi was fired upon and struck by a single gunshot in an area adjacent to the project area. in 2023, outside of the pt-fi operational area but within the province of central papua, there were at least 40 incidents of separatist violence, resulting in 20 fatalities. separatist security incidents, including shootings, attacks on civil infrastructure and arson, continue to occur in central papua and other areas near the pt-fi project area. pt-fi actively monitors security conditions and the occurrence of incidents both within the project area and regionally.
the safety of our workforce is a critical concern, and pt-fi continues to work with the indonesia government to enhance security and address security-related issues within the pt-fi project area and in nearby areas. although we have implemented measures and safeguards consistent with both international standards and our own internal standards relating to the use of force and respect for human rights, the implementation of these measures and safeguards does not guarantee that personnel, national police or other security forces will uphold these standards in every instance. we continue to limit the use of the road leading to pt-fi's mining and milling operations to secured convoys, including transport of personnel by armored vehicles in designated areas.
once the pmr is commissioned, we expect to be exposed to security risks relating to loss and theft of refined precious metals. any such loss or theft could lead to financial loss or a failure to satisfy our customers, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation and business.
we cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could result in loss of life, or disruption or suspension of pt-fi's operations. if other disruptive incidents occur, they could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
south america south america countries have historically experienced uneven periods of economic growth, as well as recession, periods of high inflation and general economic and political instability.
in peru, political uncertainty has created instability in the regulatory environment. beginning in december 2022 and continuing in 2023, heightened tensions, protests and social unrest emerged in peru following a change in the country's political leadership, which temporarily resulted in delays in the transport of supplies, products and people at our cerro verde mine. during first-quarter 2023, cerro verde also operated at reduced rates from time-to-time until it resumed normal operations in march 2023. other mining operations in the region temporarily halted mining activities as a result of the civil unrest. while demonstrations and road blockages subsided in 2023, the potential for civil unrest and disruption of commerce and supply chains continues. other operations in the region have encountered significant issues with trespassers, illegal artisanal miners and civil demonstrations that impact their current operations, expansion projects, logistical supply and product transport. such protests have occasionally been accompanied by acts of violence and property damage and continue intermittently in the region.
in chile, despite the overwhelming electoral approval of a proposal to rewrite the constitution in a 2020 referendum, the product of the constitutional assembly was rejected by a majority of voters in 2022 and 2023. uncertainty in the resolution of constitutional reform may contribute to incidents of social unrest.
we cannot predict whether similar or more significant incidents of civil unrest or political instability will occur in the future in peru or chile. although such civil unrest has not significantly impacted our results, similar events in the future could cause our south america operations to be materially impacted, in which case, we may not be able to meet our production and sales targets.
our mining operations, including future expansions or developments, depend on the availability of significant quantities of secure water supplies.
we recognize that access to clean, safe and reliable water supplies is vital to the health and livelihood of our host communities. our mining operations require physical availability and secure legal rights to significant quantities of water, and the increasing pressure on water sources requires us to consider both current and future conditions in our approach. we aim to balance our operational water requirements with those of the local communities, environment and ecosystems. most of our north america and south america mining operations are in areas where competition for water supplies is significant, and where climate change may lead to increasing scarcity of water sources in the future. continuous production at our mines and any future expansions or developments are dependent on many factors, including our ability to maintain our water rights and claims, and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies. current and long-term water risks include those that arise from our operations and events that we do not control (such as extreme weather and other physical risks associated with climate change). for further discussion of the potential physical impacts of climate change, see the related risk factor below.
as discussed in item 3. "legal proceedings," in arizona, where our operations use both surface water and groundwater, we are a participant in an active adjudication in which arizona courts have been attempting, for 50 years, to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for the gila river watershed, one of the state's largest river systems. if we are not able to satisfactorily resolve the issues being addressed in the adjudications, our water uses could be diminished or curtailed, and our operations and any future expansions at morenci, safford (including lone star) and sierrita could be adversely affected unless we are able to acquire alternative water sources.
water for our cerro verde operation in peru comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the rio chili watershed that collects water primarily from seasonal precipitation and from wastewater collected from the city of arequipa and treated at a wastewater treatment plant constructed by us. ongoing el niño weather patterns have contributed to ongoing drought conditions in the area and water shortages at our cerro verde operation are possible, which could impact our operations.
water for our el abra mining operation in chile currently comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascotán aquifer. the agreement to pump from this aquifer is subject to continued monitoring through 2029 of the aquifer water levels and select flora species to ensure that environmentally sensitive areas are not impacted by our pumping, which if impacted could cause reductions in pumping to restore water levels and could have an adverse effect on production from el abra. our permit for pumping of groundwater will expire in 2029 and any renewal may be challenging. we are evaluating water infrastructure alternatives to provide options to extend existing operations and support a future expansion, while continuing to monitor chile's regulatory and fiscal matters, as well as trends in capital costs for similar projects. in parallel, as part of the permitting process for the potential expansion, we are planning for a potential submission of an environmental impact statement during 2025, subject to ongoing stakeholder engagement and economic evaluations. there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute such water infrastructure plans or obtain a new permit, which could have an adverse impact on our operations. for further discussion, see the risk factor above relating to the geopolitical, economic and social risks associated with our international operations.
although we typically have sufficient water for our indonesia operations, the area receives considerable rainfall that makes us susceptible to periodic floods and mudslides, the nature and magnitude of which cannot be predicted. for further discussion of the overburden and related environmental challenges, including as a result of flooding in indonesia, see the related risk factor above.
although each of our mining operations currently has access to sufficient water sources to support current operational demands, as discussed above, the availability of additional supplies for potential future expansions or development will require additional investments and will take time to develop, if available. while we are taking actions to acquire additional back-up water supplies, such supplies may not be available at acceptable cost, or at all. as such, the loss of a water right or currently available water supply could force us to curtail operations or force premature closures, and the ability to obtain future water supplies could prevent future expansions or developments, thereby increasing and/or accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations.
our information and operational technology systems have been and in the future may be adversely affected by cybersecurity events, disruptions, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration, including of new technologies.
cybersecurity our industry has become increasingly supported by and dependent on digital technologies. our strategy of operating large, long-lived, geographically diverse assets has been increasingly dependent on our ability to become fully integrated and highly automated. many of our business and operational processes are heavily dependent on traditional and emerging technology systems to conduct day-to-day operations, improve safety and efficiency, and lower costs.
as our dependence on information systems, including those of our third-party service providers and vendors, grows, we have become more vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. in recent years, cybersecurity events have increased in frequency and magnitude and the methods used to gain unauthorized access change frequently, making it increasingly difficult for us to prevent cybersecurity incidents or detect and remediate incidents in a timely and effective manner. attacks have included and may include, but are not limited to, installation of malicious software, phishing, ransomware, social engineering tactics and credential attacks, insider threats, denial of service attacks, unauthorized access to data and other advanced and sophisticated cybersecurity breaches and threats, including those that increasingly target critical operational technologies and process control networks and those that are increasingly using artificial intelligence (ai) and quantum computing. such attacks may be perpetrated by a variety of bad actors, some of which may reside in jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are ineffective.
we have experienced targeted and non-targeted cybersecurity events in the past and may experience them in the future. in august 2023, we determined that we were subject to a cybersecurity incident that affected certain of our information systems. we performed an investigation of the incident and its associated impact and incurred costs to remediate, which were not material. we cannot guarantee that events of a similar nature, with potentially greater exposure, will not occur in the future.
cybersecurity threats could subject us to manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks, production downtimes, loss of sales, communication interruption or other disruptions and delays to our operations or to the transportation of products or infrastructure utilized by our operations, unauthorized release of proprietary, commercially sensitive, confidential or otherwise protected information, a misappropriation or loss of funds, the corruption of data, significant health and safety consequences, physical destruction of assets, environmental damage, loss of intellectual property, fines, penalties, litigation, regulatory or governmental investigation, liability under or termination of our contracts with third parties, damage to our reputation or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition, and which in addition could adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. we do not maintain cyber risk insurance, and the lack of insurance coverage could adversely affect our cash flows and overall profitability in the event of a material cybersecurity incident.
while the august 2023 cybersecurity incident and other cybersecurity events have not had a material impact on us, we can provide no assurance that we will not experience any such impact or additional interruptions to our operations in the future. given the unpredictability of the timing and the evolving nature and scope of information and operational technology system disruptions, the various procedures and controls we use to monitor and protect against cybersecurity threats and to mitigate potential risks arising from such threats have not been effective in some instances and may not be sufficient in preventing future cybersecurity incidents. further, as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities to cybersecurity threats.
we could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information or operational technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into our operations. system modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could, if not successfully implemented, adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
further, we increasingly depend on our information technology infrastructure for electronic communications among our operations, personnel, customers and suppliers around the world, including as a result of remote working and flexible working arrangements. these information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties that we do not control, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns because of failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, cutover activities in our restructuring and simplification initiatives, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, human errors, catastrophic events or other problems. refer to item 1c. "cybersecurity" for further information on our cybersecurity governance, risk management and strategy.
artificial intelligence and other new technologies information and operational technology systems continue to evolve and, in order to remain competitive, we must implement new technologies in a timely, cost-effective and efficient manner. for example, we may develop and apply ai in decision support systems, material characterization, equipment reliability, mineral extraction and remote/autonomous operation. these applications may become important in our operations over time. we also are advancing a series of initiatives to incorporate new applications, technologies and data analytics to our leaching processes. for additional information on our leaching innovation initiatives, see md&a. our failure to successfully implement new technologies, including ai, may adversely affect our competitiveness and, consequently, our results of operations. in addition, we may utilize ai and other new technologies in software provided by third parties to enhance our capabilities in producing copper, improving business processes and responding to threats to our technology platforms. the use of ai may increase our exposure to cybersecurity risks and additional risks relating to the protection of data, including increased exposure of confidential or otherwise protected information to unauthorized recipients, which could result in liability under or termination of our contracts with third parties, misuse of our intellectual property or other unintended consequences.
major public health crises may have an adverse impact on our business.
pandemics, epidemics, widespread illness or other major public health crises could negatively impact the global economy and adversely affect our operations and business, including our ability to conduct business, demand for the commodities we produce and our profit margins. actions taken by governmental authorities and third parties to contain and mitigate the risk of spread of any major public health crisis may negatively impact our business, including a disruption of or change to our operating plans. for example, in march 2020, we had to temporarily transition our cerro verde mine to care and maintenance status and adjust operations to prioritize critical activities in response to a decree issued by the peru government relating to covid-19.
our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions or other restrictions, or if workplace entry and travel are restricted resulting in the delay of key personnel or external consultants accessing our sites. a major health crisis at any of our operating sites, and particularly at pt-fi's remote operating site, could disrupt or change our operating plans, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
human capital risks labor disputes or labor unrest could disrupt our operations.
our business is dependent on maintaining good relations with our workforce. a significant portion of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. refer to items 1. and 2. "business and properties" for additional information regarding labor matters, and expiration dates of such agreements. as of december 31, 2023, approximately 29% of our global labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 16% of our global labor force was covered by agreements that will or were scheduled to expire during 2024 or that had expired as of december 31, 2023, and continue to be negotiated.
labor agreements are negotiated on a periodic basis and may not be renewed on reasonably satisfactory terms to us or at all. if we do not successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements with our union workers, we may incur prolonged strikes and other work stoppages at our mining operations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. additionally, if we enter into a new labor agreement with any union that significantly increases our labor costs relative to our competitors, our ability to compete may be materially adversely affected.
we have in the past and could in the future experience labor disruptions such as work stoppages, work slowdowns, union organizing campaigns, strikes, or lockouts that could adversely affect our operations. for example, in third-quarter 2020, we experienced a five-day labor-related work stoppage related to covid-19 travel restrictions when a small group of workers at pt-fi staged protests and a blockade restricting access to the main road to the mining operations area. we reached an amicable resolution with the group of workers while upholding our covid-19 safety protocols. there were no strikes or lockouts at any of our operations for the three years ended december 31, 2023.
we cannot predict whether additional labor disruptions will occur. significant reductions in productivity or protracted work stoppages at one or more of our operations could significantly reduce our production and sales volumes or disrupt operations, which could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
our success depends on our ability to recruit, retain, develop and advance qualified personnel.
our success is dependent on the contributions of our highly skilled and experienced workforce. our business depends on our ability to recruit, retain, develop and advance a qualified, inclusive and diverse workforce at all levels, including sufficient personnel to develop, implement and operate new technologies. our ability to recruit qualified personnel is affected by the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions, the impact on the labor supply because of general economic conditions and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages. since 2021, we have experienced an increasingly competitive labor market and labor shortages at our north america operations. the tight labor market, hiring more contract workers, and increased competition from other employers in north america continue to represent strategic challenges that are increasing our costs, reducing efficiency, impacting production and our ability to further expand current mining rates and will impact the timing of future developments in north america. if we fail to recruit, retain, develop and advance qualified, inclusive and diverse personnel necessary for the efficient operation of our business, we could continue to face labor challenges, which may result in, but are not limited to, decreased profitability, further decreases to productivity and efficiency, ongoing safety performance challenges, and the further delay of current and potential development projects, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our performance.
risks related to development projects and mineral reserves development projects are inherently risky and may require more capital and have lower economic returns than anticipated, and the development of our underground mines are also subject to other unique risks.
mine development projects typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development phase before production is possible. there are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects including, but not limited to, unexpected or difficult geological formations or conditions and environmental challenges, potential delays (including the ability and timeframe to obtain permits, or because of weather, social or political unrest or any major public health crisis), cost overruns, availability of economic sources and reliable access to water, power and infrastructure, lower levels of production during ramp-up periods, shortages of materials or labor, construction defects, equipment breakdowns and injuries to persons and property, social acceptance of such projects by communities and indigenous peoples, partner alignment and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties. creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors and although we devote significant time and resources to our project planning, approval and review processes, many of our development projects are highly complex and rely on factors that are outside of our control, which may cause the actual time and capital required to complete a development project and operating costs after completion to exceed our estimates, especially in periods of high inflation.
all of our copper and gold production in indonesia comes from underground mining in the grasberg minerals district. the development of our underground mines is also subject to other unique risks including, but not limited to, underground fires or floods, ventilating harmful gases, fall-of-ground accidents, and seismic activity resulting from unexpected or difficult geological formations or conditions, which we experience from time to time in the grasberg minerals district. while we anticipate taking all measures that we deem reasonable and prudent in connection with the development of our underground mines to safely manage production, there can be no assurance that these risks will not cause schedule delays, revised mine plans, injuries to persons and property, or increased capital costs, any of which may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. refer to items 1. and 2. "business and properties" and md&a for further discussion of pt-fi's development of the kucing liar deposit in the grasberg minerals district and our other development projects.
we may not be able to maintain or grow our mineral reserves.
our existing mineral reserves will be depleted over time by production from our operations. because our profits are primarily derived from our mining operations, our ability to replenish our mineral reserves is essential to our long-term success. depleted mineral reserves can be replaced in several ways, including expanding known ore bodies, reducing operating costs that could extend the life of a mine by allowing us to cost-effectively process ore types that were previously considered uneconomic, investing in and advancing new technologies (such as our leaching innovation initiatives), locating new deposits or acquiring interests in mineral reserves from third parties.
exploration is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and uncertainties, requires substantial capital expenditures (which may differ significantly from those estimated) and, in some instances, advances in processing technology, and is frequently unsuccessful in discovering significant mineral resources since new, large, long-life deposits are increasingly scarce. accordingly, our current or future exploration programs may not result in the discovery of additional deposits that can be produced profitably. even if significant mineral resources are discovered, it will likely take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change.
we may not be able to discover, enhance, develop or acquire mineral reserves in sufficient quantities to maintain or grow our current reserve levels, which could negatively affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources are uncertain and the volume and grade of ore actually recovered may vary from our estimates.
our estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources have been prepared in accordance with the disclosure requirements of subpart 1300 of u.s. securities and exchange commission (sec) regulation s-k. there are numerous uncertainties inherent in mineral estimates. such estimates are, to a large extent, based on assumed long-term prices for the commodities we produce, primarily copper, gold and molybdenum, and interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques, which may not necessarily be indicative of future results. our mineral estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies. we conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk. we revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies. geological assumptions about our mineral resources that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available.
estimates of mineral reserves, or the cost at which we anticipate the mineral reserves will be recovered, are based on assumptions, such as metal prices and other economic inputs. changes to such assumptions may require revisions to mineral reserve estimates which could affect our asset carrying values and may also negatively impact our future financial condition and results. until mineral reserves are actually mined and processed, the quantity of ore and grades must be considered as an estimate only.
in addition, if the market prices for the commodities we produce decline from assumed levels, if production costs increase or recovery rates decrease, or if applicable laws and regulations are adversely changed, there can be no assurance that the indicated level of recovery will be realized or that mineral reserves can be mined or processed profitably. if we determine that certain of our estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves have become uneconomic, this may ultimately lead to a reduction in our aggregate reported mineral reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
additionally, the term "mineral resources" does not indicate recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as defined by the sec. estimates of mineral resources are subject to further exploration and evaluation of development and operating costs, grades, recoveries and other material factors, and, therefore, are subject to considerable uncertainty. mineral resources do not meet the threshold for mineral reserve modifying factors, such as engineering, legal and/or economic feasibility, that would allow for the conversion to mineral reserves. accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimated mineral resources not included in mineral reserves will become recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves.
regulatory, environmental and social risks the costs of compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our operations may constrain existing operations or expansion opportunities. related permit and other approval requirements may delay or result in a suspension of our operations.
our operations are subject to extensive and complex environmental laws and regulations governing the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances; solid waste disposal; air emissions; wastewater discharges; remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination, including mine closures and reclamation; protection of endangered and threatened species and designation of critical habitats; and other related matters. these laws and regulations are subject to change and to changing interpretation by governmental agencies and other bodies vested with broad supervisory authority. as a mining company, compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations is an integral and costly part of our business. in addition, we must obtain regulatory permits and approvals to start, continue and expand operations.
certain federal and similar state laws and regulations may expose us to joint and several liability for environmental damages caused by our operations, or by previous owners or operators of properties we acquired or are currently operating or at sites where we previously sent materials for processing, recycling or disposal. as discussed in more detail in the risk factor below relating to costs incurred for remediating environmental conditions on our properties that are no longer in operation, we have substantial obligations for environmental remediation on properties previously owned or operated by freeport minerals corporation (fmc) and certain of its affiliates. noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in material penalties or other liabilities. in addition, compliance with these laws may from time to time result in delays in or changes to our development or expansion plans. compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs, which we expect will continue to increase over time because of increased regulatory oversight, adoption of increasingly stringent environmental standards, and other factors.
new or revised environmental regulatory requirements are frequently proposed, many of which have resulted and may in the future result in substantially increased costs for our business, including those regarding financial obligations. regulations have been considered at various governmental levels to increase financial responsibility requirements for mine closure and reclamation. federal regulations obligating additional hazardous air pollutant controls at our miami, arizona smelter are also under consideration. adoption of such environmental regulations or more stringent application of existing regulations may materially increase our costs, threaten certain operating activities and constrain our expansion opportunities. in addition, there can be no assurance that restrictions relating to conservation will not have an adverse impact on expansion of our operations or not result in delays in project development, or constraints on exploration or operations in impacted areas.
we have incurred and expect to incur environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs (including our joint venture partners' shares) to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations. the timing and amounts of estimated payments could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, changes in scope and costs of reclamation activities, the settlement of environmental matters and the rate at which actual spending occurs on continuing matters.
we are also subject to extensive regulation of worker health and safety. our mines are inspected on a regular basis by government regulators who may issue citations and orders when they believe a violation has occurred under applicable mining regulations. if inspections result in an alleged violation, we may be subject to fines and penalties and, in instances of alleged significant violations, our mining operations or industrial facilities could be subject to temporary or extended closures.
many other governmental bodies regulate other aspects of our operations, and our failure to comply with these legal requirements can result in substantial penalties. in addition, new laws and regulations, including executive orders, or changes to or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations by courts or regulatory authorities occur regularly, but are difficult to predict. any such variations could negatively impact the mining sector, including our business, substantially increase costs to achieve compliance or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
for additional information regarding the various regulations affecting us, see items 1. and 2. "business and properties."
we incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on or related to properties that have not been operated in many years.
fmc and its subsidiaries, and many of their affiliates and predecessor companies, have been involved in exploration, mining, milling, smelting and manufacturing in the u.s. for more than a century. activities that occurred in the late 19th century and the 20th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before u.s. industrial companies fully understood the long-term effects of their operations on the surrounding environment.
companies like fmc are now legally responsible for remediating hazardous substances released into the environment on or from properties owned or operated by them as well as properties where they arranged for disposal of such substances, irrespective of when the release into the environment occurred or who caused it. that liability is often asserted on a joint and several basis with other prior and subsequent owners, operators and arrangers, meaning that each owner or operator of the property is, and each arranger may be, held fully responsible for the remediation, although in many cases some or all of the other responsible parties no longer exist, do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found. as a result, because of our acquisition of fmc, many of the subsidiary companies we now own are potentially responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the u.s., and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues. we are also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have resulted in injury, destruction or loss of natural resources.
at december 31, 2023, we had more than 80 active remediation projects in 22 u.s. states. in addition, fmc and certain affiliates and predecessor companies were parties to agreements relating to the transfer of businesses or properties that contained indemnification provisions relating to environmental matters, and from time to time these provisions become the source of claims against us.
our environmental obligation estimates are primarily based upon:
•our knowledge and beliefs about complex scientific and historical facts and circumstances that in many cases occurred many decades ago;
•our beliefs and assumptions regarding the nature, extent and duration of remediation activities that we will be required to undertake and the estimated costs of those remediation activities, which are subject to varying interpretations; and
•our beliefs regarding the requirements that are imposed on us by existing laws and regulations and, in some cases, the clarification of uncertain regulatory requirements that could materially affect our environmental obligation estimates.
significant adjustments to these estimates are likely to occur in the future as additional information becomes available. the actual environmental costs may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs, and any such changes could be material.
in addition, remediation standards imposed by the u.s. environmental protection agency and state environmental agencies have generally become more stringent over time and may become even more stringent in the future. imposition of more stringent remediation standards, particularly for arsenic and lead in soils, poses a risk that additional remediation work could be required at our active remediation sites and at sites that we have already remediated to the satisfaction of the responsible governmental agencies, and may increase the risk of toxic tort litigation.
refer to items 1. and 2. "business and properties" and note 12 for further discussion of our environmental obligations.
we face increasing, complex and changing regulatory and stakeholder and other third-party expectations relating to our climate and energy transition plans, which may adversely affect our business. further, we may not be able to timely or successfully transition from fossil fuel sources for our significant energy needs, which may result in reputational damage.
our operations require significant energy, much of which is currently from fossil fuel sources and is obtained from third parties under long-term contracts. energy represented 19% of our copper mine site operating costs in 2023, and is expected to approximate 20% in 2024. the principal sources of energy consumption at our mining operations are: diesel fuel, which powers mine trucks and other transportation equipment; purchased electricity, which powers core facilities and certain on-site metal processing operations; and coal and natural gas, which provides electricity at certain operations.
existing and proposed governmental conventions, laws, rules, regulations, policies and standards as well as existing and proposed voluntary disclosure standards and frameworks (both in the u.s. and internationally), including those related to climate change, carbon taxes or greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, may in the future add significantly to our operating costs, limit or modify our operations, impact the competitiveness of the commodities we produce, and require more resources to comply and remediate in response. for additional information on climate change conventions, laws, regulations and standards applicable to fcx, refer to items 1. and 2. "business and properties."
in response to climate change and societal or stakeholder demands for action, we have announced 2030 ghg emissions reduction targets and a 2050 net zero aspiration, each of which will result in additional costs to us, the totality of which we cannot currently estimate with accuracy, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to achieve any current or future ghg emissions targets or aspirations.
while we strive to transition to more renewable power sources for our mining operations, as a commercial consumer of power, our ability to reduce our ghg emissions associated with our power consumption demand is dependent upon the mix of our suppliers and locally-available renewable energy resources at our various sites, including our ability to successfully develop renewable energy projects and negotiate power purchase agreements. the transition to renewable and other energy sources could, among other things, increase our capital expenditures, and operating and energy costs, depending on the scope, magnitude and timing of increased regulation of fossil-fuel based energy production, including ghg emissions, as well as the availability of alternative energy sources.
in certain aspects of our operations, our ability to reduce our ghg emissions is directly dependent on the actions of third parties and technological solutions and innovation, and our ability to make significant, rapid changes in our ghg emissions in response to potential future regulations may be limited. for example, our diesel-fueled haul trucks are a significant contributor to ghg emissions at our north america and south america operations. we are evaluating options for the electrification of our haul trucks, but reduction of emissions from such haul trucks will depend upon the development and availability of commercially viable alternative-fueled mining equipment by our third-party suppliers. at our remote mining operations in indonesia, pt-fi owns and operates a coal-fired power plant and is advancing plans to transition its existing energy source from coal to liquefied natural gas by planning investments in a new gas-fired combined cycle facility. our ability to transition to commercially viable alternative sources of energy across our operations globally will depend on, among other things, additional studies, technological considerations and permit approvals. even if we do implement new technologies, our stakeholders and other third parties may not be satisfied with our approach to reducing our ghg emissions. for further information, see the risk factor below relating to the increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from stakeholders and other third parties, including creditors, with respect to our esg practices, performance and disclosures.
the physical impacts of climate change may adversely affect our mining operations, workforce, communities, biodiversity and ecosystems, supply chains and customers, which may result in increased costs.
we recognize that as the climate changes, our operations, workforce, communities, biodiversity and ecosystems, supply chains and customers may be exposed to changes in the frequency, intensity and/or duration of intense storms, drought, flooding (including from sea level rise at our coastal operations), wildfire, and other extreme weather events and patterns (such as extreme heat). such potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would vary by operation based on particular geographic circumstances. for example, at many of our mine sites, climate change is projected to impact local precipitation regimes, resulting in shorter-duration, higher-intensity storm events, and the potential for less precipitation overall. we could face increased operational costs associated with managing additional volumes of storm water during more intense future events, including supply disruption, delays, damage to or inaccessibility of our facilities and increased pricing of consumables and components we purchase. in addition, the potential for overall decreases in precipitation could affect the availability of water needed for our operations, leading to increased operating costs, or in extreme cases, disruptions to our mining operations. for additional information regarding risks relating to availability of water and operational risks inherent in mining, see related risk factors above.
increasing scrutiny, action and evolving expectations from stakeholders and other third parties with respect to our esg practices, performance, commitments and disclosures may impact our reputation, increase our costs and impact our access to capital or business strategy.
stakeholder and other third-party scrutiny related to our esg practices, commitments, performance and disclosures continues to increase and evolve. we have adopted certain policies and programs, including with respect to responsible production frameworks, climate change, water stewardship, biodiversity and land management, tailings management and stewardship, waste management, safety and health, human capital management, human rights, social performance and community and indigenous peoples relations, political activity and spending practices, and supply chains/responsible sourcing. it is possible, however, that our stakeholders and other third parties might not be satisfied or even disagree with our esg practices, goals, initiatives, commitments, performance and/or disclosures, or the speed of their adoption, implementation and measurable success. if we do not meet our stakeholders' and other third parties' evolving expectations, including any failure or perceived failure to achieve our stated goals and targets or industry standards or any allegations that our stated goals or targets should be altered, our reputation, access to and cost of capital, business strategy and stock price could be negatively impacted.
investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, creditors and other influential investors are increasingly focused on our esg practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the esg implications of their investments and lending decisions.
organizations that provide information to investors and financial institutions on esg performance and related matters have developed quantitative and qualitative data collection processes and ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to esg matters. such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. in addition, many investors have created their own proprietary ratings that inform their investment and voting decisions. unfavorable ratings or assessment of our esg practices, including our compliance with certain voluntary disclosure standards and frameworks, may lead to negative investor sentiment toward us, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and cost of capital.
similarly, many financial institutions are increasingly incorporating esg ratings or assessments into their credit risk assessments, and screen companies based on their esg practices and performance when making lending decisions. if we are unable to meet the esg lending criteria set by our creditors or are required to take certain remediation steps to satisfy such criteria, our access to capital on terms we find favorable may be limited and our costs may increase.
as we continue to focus on our esg practices, goals, initiatives, commitments, performance and disclosures, and as esg-related laws and regulations and voluntary disclosure standards and frameworks continue to evolve, we have expanded our public disclosures in these areas. refer to items 1. and 2. "business and properties" for additional information on esg conventions, laws, regulations and standards applicable to fcx. such disclosures may reflect goals, aspirations, commitments, cost estimates and other expectations and assumptions, including over long timeframes, which are necessarily uncertain and may not be realized.
further, the voluntary disclosure standards or frameworks we choose to align with are evolving and may change over time and our interpretation of such disclosure standards and frameworks may differ from those of others, either of which may result in a lack of consistent or meaningful comparative data from period to period and/or significant revisions to our goals and aspirations or reported progress in achieving such goals and aspirations.
ensuring that there are adequate systems and processes in place to comply with the various esg tracking and disclosure obligations, or to respond to business partners or other affiliates in our value chain that have requested, or may in the future request, esg-related data or information from us to meet their disclosure obligations, will require management's time and expense. if we do not adapt to or comply with stakeholder or other third parties expectations, including with respect to evolving esg disclosure standards and frameworks, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, we may suffer from reputational damage and our business, financial condition, cost of capital and/or stock price could be materially adversely affected.
in addition, our customers, end users and other third parties may require that we implement certain additional esg procedures or standards before they will start or continue to do business with us, which could lead to preferential buying based on our esg practices compared to our competitors' esg practices. further, being associated with activities by business partners or other affiliates that have or are perceived to have individual or cumulative adverse impacts on the environment, climate, biodiversity and land management, water access and management, human rights or cultural heritage could negatively affect our reputation and impose additional costs.
failure or the perceived failure to manage our relationships with the communities and/or indigenous peoples where we operate or that are near our operations could harm our reputation and social license to operate.
our relationships with the communities and/or indigenous peoples where we operate or that are adjacent to or near our operations are critical to the long-term success of our existing operations and the development of any future projects. there is ongoing and increasing stakeholder and other third-party concern relating to a company's social license to operate and the perceived effects of mining activities on the environment and on communities impacted by such activities. we may engage in activities, such as exploration, production, construction or expansion of our operations that have or are perceived to have adverse impacts on the local communities and their relevant stakeholders, society as a whole, indigenous peoples, cultural heritage, human rights and the environment, including land management and associated biodiversity, among other things. for example, our operations may take place on or adjacent to indigenous peoples' ancestral lands, and such indigenous peoples may assert rights to the lands where we operate. further, we may be required or expected by our stakeholders and other third parties to consult with and/or obtain consent from indigenous peoples with respect to these operations. we also may be required to demonstrate our capacity to protect ecosystems through improved practices and technological solutions to maintain our social license to operate, or to obtain such social license to operate for future development projects or expansions.
in addition, our assets are generally long-lived and stakeholders' perceptions and expectations can change over the life of the mine. changes in the aspirations and expectations of local communities and/or indigenous peoples where we operate, with respect to our employee health and safety performance and our contributions to infrastructure, community development, environmental management, including land management and associated biodiversity, and other factors could affect our social license to operate and reputation, and could lead to delays and/or increased costs if expansions or new projects are blocked either temporarily or for extended periods. failure to effectively engage with communities on an ongoing basis, including the withdrawal of consent or support of indigenous peoples, other stakeholders or other third parties, could adversely impact our business, damage our reputation and/or result in loss of rights to explore, operate or develop our projects.
risks related to our common stock our holding company structure may impact our ability to service our debt, declare dividends, and repurchase shares and debt.
we are a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock and intercompany receivables of our subsidiaries. as a result, our ability to service our indebtedness, pay dividends, and repurchase shares and debt is dependent on the generation of cash flows by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, loan, debt repayment or otherwise. our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to make funds available to us to service our indebtedness, pay dividends, or repurchase shares and debt. dividends from subsidiaries that are not wholly owned are shared with other equity owners. cash at our international operations is also typically subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation into the u.s.
in addition, our subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to us or repay loans to us, to enable us to service our indebtedness, pay dividends, or repurchase shares and debt. each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal restrictions, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. certain of our subsidiaries are parties to credit agreements that restrict their ability to make distributions or loan repayments to us if such subsidiary is in default under such agreements, or to transfer substantially all of the assets of such subsidiary without the consent of the lenders. our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries' assets upon their liquidation, reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries' creditors, including any trade creditors.
as more fully described in note 10, during 2021, our board of directors (board) adopted a performance-based payout framework, which currently includes base and variable dividends and a share repurchase program. our ability to continue to pay dividends (base or variable) and the timing and amount of any share repurchases is at the discretion of our board and management, respectively, and is subject to a number of factors, including not exceeding our net debt target, capital availability, our financial results, cash requirements, global economic conditions, changes in laws, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board or management, as applicable. repurchases of our common stock under our repurchase program are discretionary up to the board-approved limit, and our share repurchase program may be modified, increased, suspended or terminated at any time at the board's discretion. our dividend payments and share repurchases may change, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares at all or in any particular amounts. a reduction or suspension in our dividend payments or share repurchases could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock.
anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult.
anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult. these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by the board. refer to exhibit 4.1 for further discussion of our anti-takeover provisions.
further, our by-laws provide to the fullest extent permitted by law that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the court of chancery of the state of delaware (or, if the court of chancery does not have, or declines to accept, jurisdiction, the u.s. district court for the district of delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) action asserting a claim that is based upon a violation of a duty by any of our current or former directors, officers, employees or stockholders in such capacity, (iii) action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or to which the delaware general corporation law confers jurisdiction upon the court of chancery of the state of delaware, (iv) action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, or (v) action asserting an "internal corporate claim" as that term is defined in section 115 of the delaware general corporation law. the exclusive forum provision may increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims or limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us or our directors, officers and other employees. alternatively, if a court were to find the exclusive forum provision contained in our by-laws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions. the exclusive forum provision in our by-laws will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under the federal securities laws including the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, or the securities act of 1933, as amended, or the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
in addition, because we are incorporated in delaware, we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with, or acquisition of, us.
these provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to our stockholders.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" contained in part ii of our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2022.
overview we are a leading international mining company with headquarters in phoenix, arizona. we operate large, long-lived, geographically diverse assets with significant proven and probable mineral reserves of copper, gold and molybdenum.
we are one of the world's largest publicly traded copper producers. our portfolio of assets includes the grasberg minerals district in indonesia, one of the world's largest copper and gold deposits; and significant mining operations in north america and south america, including the large-scale morenci minerals district in arizona and the cerro verde operation in peru.
our results for 2023 reflect strong operating performance, including achievement of a number of important initiatives to advance growth options, to position us for the future and aimed at enhancing value. despite economic uncertainty, including rising costs, we have continued to generate positive operating cash flows. we believe the actions we have taken in recent years to build a solid balance sheet and maintain flexible organic growth options while maintaining liquidity, will allow us to continue to execute our business plans in a prudent manner and preserve substantial future asset values.
we believe that we have a high-quality portfolio of long-lived copper assets that are positioned to generate long-
term value, and we remain focused on executing our operating and investment plans. our underground mining operations at the grasberg minerals district in indonesia continue to perform well, with copper and gold production increasing in each of the past three years, including achievement of multiple operating records during 2023.
furthermore, projects to expand our domestic smelting and refining capacity in indonesia are progressing, with construction progress for these projects measured at over 90% at year-end 2023. we are also advancing a series of initiatives across our north america and south america operations to incorporate new applications, technologies and data analytics to our leaching processes. in fourth-quarter 2023, we achieved our initial run rate target of approximately 200 million pounds of copper per year through these initiatives.
net income attributable to common stock totaled $1.8 billion in 2023 and $3.5 billion in 2022. our results in 2023, compared to 2022, primarily reflect the change in our economic interest in pt freeport indonesia (pt-fi) (refer to note 3 for further discussion) and increased production costs, including for maintenance and supplies. refer to
"consolidated results" for discussion of items impacting our consolidated results for the two years ended december
31, 2023.
at december 31, 2023, we had consolidated debt of $9.4 billion and consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $4.8
billion ($5.8 billion including restricted cash and cash equivalents associated with pt-fi's export proceeds required to be temporarily deposited in indonesia banks), resulting in net debt of $3.6 billion ($0.8 billion excluding net debt for the manyar smelter and precious metals refinery (pmr) in indonesia - collectively, the indonesia smelter projects). refer to "net debt" for reconciliations of consolidated debt, consolidated cash and cash equivalents and consolidated restricted cash and cash equivalents to net debt.
other than $0.7 billion in scheduled senior note maturities in november 2024, we have no further senior note maturities until 2027. at december 31, 2023, we had no borrowings and $3.0 billion available under our revolving
77
table of contents credit facility, and pt-fi and cerro verde had $1.75 billion and $350 million, respectively, available under their revolving credit facilities. refer to note 8 and "capital resources and liquidity" for further discussion of our debt.
we have significant mineral reserves, mineral resources and future development opportunities within our portfolio of mining assets. at december 31, 2023, our estimated consolidated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves totaled 104.1 billion pounds of copper, 24.5 million ounces of gold and 3.34 billion pounds of molybdenum. refer to note 17 and "critical accounting estimates - mineral reserves" for further discussion.
during 2023, production from our mines totaled 4.2 billion pounds of copper, 2.0 million ounces of gold and 82
million pounds of molybdenum. following is the allocation of our consolidated copper, gold and molybdenum production in 2023 by geographic location:
copper       gold       molybdenum north america        32  %       1  %            73  %    a south america        29          -               27
indonesia            39         99                -
100  %     100  %           100  %
a. our north america copper mines produced 37% of consolidated molybdenum production, and our henderson and climax molybdenum mines produced 36%.
copper production from the morenci mine in north america, cerro verde mine in peru and the grasberg minerals district in indonesia together totaled 76% of our consolidated copper production in 2023.
outlook our financial results vary as a result of fluctuations in market prices primarily for copper, gold and, to a lesser extent, molybdenum, as well as other factors. world market prices for these commodities have fluctuated historically and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. refer to "markets," and item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2023, for further discussion. because we cannot control the price of our products, the key measures that management focuses on in operating our business are sales volumes, unit net cash costs, operating cash flows and capital expenditures.
consolidated sales volumes following are our projected consolidated sales volumes for 2024 and actual consolidated sales volumes for 2023:
2024            2023
-projected         -actual copper(millions of recoverable pounds):
north america copper mines                      1,280           1,361
south america mining                            1,130           1,200
indonesia mining                                1,680           1,525
total                                           4,090           4,086
gold(thousands of recoverable ounces)           1,975           1,713
molybdenum(millions of recoverable                 85    a         81
pounds)
a. includes 55 million pounds from our north america and south america copper mines and 30 million pounds from our molybdenum mines.
for the year 2024, consolidated copper production volumes are expected to exceed consolidated sales volumes, reflecting the deferral of approximately 90 million pounds of copper from pt-fi concentrates that is expected to be processed by the manyar smelter and sold as refined metal in future periods.
projected sales volumes are dependent on operational performance; extension of pt-fi's export permits for copper concentrates and anode slimes beyond may 2024; the timing of the ramp-up of the indonesia smelter projects;
weather-related conditions, including ongoing el niño weather impacts; timing of shipments and other factors. for further discussion of other important factors that could cause results to differ materially from projections, refer to "cautionary statement" below, and item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2023.
78
table of contents consolidated unit net cash costs consolidated unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for our copper mines are expected to average $1.60 per pound of copper for the year 2024, based on achievement of current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming average prices of $2,000 per ounce of gold and $19.00 per pound of molybdenum for the year 2024. estimated consolidated unit net cash costs for the year 2024 include assessment of export duties at pt-fi of $0.11 per pound of copper (refer to "operations - indonesia mining" for further discussion). quarterly unit net cash costs vary with fluctuations in sales volumes and realized prices, primarily for gold and molybdenum. the impact of price changes on consolidated unit net cash costs for the year 2024 would approximate $0.04 per pound of copper for each
$100 per ounce change in the average price of gold and $0.02 per pound of copper for each $2 per pound change in the average price of molybdenum.
consolidated operating cash flows our consolidated operating cash flows vary with sales volumes; prices realized from copper, gold and molybdenum sales; production costs; income taxes; other working capital changes; and other factors. our consolidated operating cash flows are estimated to approximate $5.8 billion (including $0.1 billion of working capital and other sources)
for the year 2024, based on current sales volume and cost estimates, and assuming average prices of $3.75 per pound of copper, $2,000 per ounce of gold and $19.00 per pound of molybdenum for the year 2024. estimated consolidated operating cash flows in 2024 also reflect a projected income tax provision of $2.3 billion (refer to "consolidated results - income taxes" for further discussion of our projected income tax rate). the impact of price changes on operating cash flows for the year 2024 would approximate $400 million for each $0.10 per pound change in the average price of copper, $180 million for each $100 per ounce change in the average price of gold and $120 million for each $2 per pound change in the average price of molybdenum.
consolidated capital expenditures capital expenditures for the year 2024 are expected to approximate $4.6 billion (including $2.3 billion for major mining projects and $1.0 billion for the indonesia smelter projects). projected capital expenditures for the indonesia smelter projects in 2024 exclude capitalized interest and $0.3 billion of estimated commissioning and owner's costs. projected capital expenditures for major mining projects include $1.1 billion for planned projects, primarily associated with underground mine development in the grasberg minerals district and potential expansion projects in north america, and $1.2 billion for discretionary growth projects. we closely monitor market conditions and will continue to adjust our operating plans, including capital expenditures, to protect our liquidity and preserve our asset values, as necessary.
capital expenditures for the indonesia smelter projects are being funded with the remaining proceeds from pt-fi's senior notes and availability under its revolving credit facility.
markets world prices for copper, gold and molybdenum can fluctuate significantly. during the period from january 2014
through december 2023, the london metal exchange (lme) copper settlement price varied from a low of $1.96 per pound in 2016 to a record high of $4.87 per pound in 2022; the london bullion market association (london) pm gold price fluctuated from a low of $1,049 per ounce in 2015 to a record high of $2,078 per ounce in 2023, and the platts metals daily molybdenum dealer oxide weekly average price ranged from a low of $4.46 per pound in 2015 to a high of
$37.42 per pound in 2023. copper, gold and molybdenum prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control as described further in item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2023.

table of contents this graph presents lme copper settlement prices and the combined reported stocks of copper at the lme, commodity exchange inc. and the shanghai futures exchange from january 2014 through december 2023. for the year 2023, the lme copper settlement prices averaged $3.85 per pound (ranging from a low of $3.54 per pound in october to a high of
$4.28 per pound in january) and closed at $3.84 per pound on december 29, 2023. recent prices have been correlated with sentiment on the chinese economy and financial system drivers tied to interest rates, inflation data and movements in the united states (u.s.) dollar exchange rates. near-term fundamentals for copper improved in late
2023 with continued strong demand in china and the u.s. and significant reductions in the supply outlook. the lme copper settlement price was $3.86 per pound on january 31, 2024.
we believe long-term fundamentals for copper are favorable and that future demand will be supported by copper's role in the global transition to renewable power, electric vehicles and other carbon-reduction initiatives, continued urbanization in developing countries and growing connectivity globally. the small number of approved, large-scale projects beyond those that have been announced, the long lead times required to permit and build new mines and declining ore grades at existing operations continue to highlight the fundamental supply challenges for copper.

this graph presents the platts metals daily molybdenum dealer oxide weekly average price from january 2014 through december 2023. for the year 2023, the weekly average price for molybdenum averaged $24.12 per pound (ranging from a low of $16.86 per pound in november to a high of $37.42 per pound in february) and was $19.77 per pound on december
29, 2023. overall global demand is being driven by key molybdenum-consuming segments (energy, aerospace and defense) offset by weakness in commodity steel-consuming segments (construction). like copper, demand for molybdenum is positively impacted by new technologies for clean energy. the platts metals daily molybdenum dealer oxide weekly average price was $19.52 per pound on january 26, 2024.

table of contents critical accounting estimates md&a is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) in the u.s. the preparation of these statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. we base these estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances;
however, reported results could differ from those based on the current estimates under different assumptions or conditions. the areas requiring the use of management's estimates are also discussed in note 1 under the subheading
"use of estimates." management has reviewed the following discussion of its development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors (board).
taxes refer to note 11, and item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2023, for further discussion of our consolidated income taxes.
in preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate the actual amount of income taxes currently payable or receivable as well as deferred income tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates or laws is recognized in income in the period in which such changes are enacted.
our operations are in multiple jurisdictions where uncertainties arise in the application of complex tax regulations. some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, while others are defined by general tax laws and regulations. we and our subsidiaries are subject to reviews of our income tax filings and other tax payments, and disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation of our contracts or laws.
on january 1, 2023, the provisions of the u.s. inflation reduction act of 2022 (the act) became applicable, and we have made interpretations of certain provisions of the act. based on these interpretations, we determined that the provisions of the act did not materially impact our financial results in 2023; however, future guidance released by the u.s. department of the treasury (treasury) could differ from our interpretations.
in december 2021, the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd) published a framework for pillar two of the global anti-base erosion rules (globe). the globe rules were designed to coordinate participating jurisdictions in updating the international tax system to ensure that large multinational companies pay a minimum level of income tax. recommendations from the oecd regarding a global minimum income tax and other changes are being considered and/or implemented in jurisdictions where we operate. at current metals market prices, we believe enactment of the recommended framework in jurisdictions where we operate will result in minimal impacts to our financial results in the near term.
we operate in the u.s. and multiple international tax jurisdictions, and our income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities in those jurisdictions who may challenge any tax position on these returns.
uncertainty in a tax position may arise because tax laws are subject to interpretation. we use significant judgment to (1) determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and
(2) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition.
we have uncertain tax positions related to income tax assessments in peru and indonesia, including penalties and interest, which have not been recorded at december 31, 2023. final taxes paid may be dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities. in certain jurisdictions, we pay a portion of the disputed amount before formally appealing an assessment. such payment is recorded as a receivable if we believe the amount is collectible. refer to note 12 for further discussion.
a valuation allowance is provided for those deferred income tax assets for which available information, including positive and negative evidence, suggests that the related benefits will not be realized. in determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences, carryback opportunities, as well as prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction. if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred income
82
table of contents tax assets, we will increase our valuation allowance. conversely, if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced. our valuation allowances totaled $3.9 billion at december 31, 2023, and covered all of our u.s. foreign tax credits and u.s. federal net operating losses (nols), substantially all of our u.s. state and foreign nols, as well as a portion of our u.s. federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets. during 2023, our valuation allowances decreased by $91 million.
environmental obligations refer to notes 1 and 12, and item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2023, for further discussion of environmental obligations, including a summary of changes in our estimated environmental obligations for the three years ended december 31, 2023.
our current and historical operating activities are subject to various national, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern emissions of air pollutants; discharges of water pollutants; generation, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, hazardous wastes and other toxic materials; and remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination, and compliance with these laws and regulations requires significant expenditures. environmental expenditures are charged to expense or capitalized, depending upon their future economic benefits. the guidance provided by u.s. gaap requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred, and the cost can be reasonably estimated. at december 31, 2023, environmental obligations recorded in our consolidated balance sheet totaled $1.9 billion, which reflect obligations for environmental liabilities attributed to the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act of 1980 or analogous state programs and for estimated future costs associated with environmental matters.
accounting for environmental obligations represents a critical accounting estimate because (i) changes to environmental laws and regulations and/or circumstances affecting our operations could result in significant changes to our estimates, which could have a significant impact on our results of operations, (ii) we will not incur most of these costs for a number of years, requiring us to make estimates over a long period, (iii)
calculating the discounted cash flows for certain of our environmental obligations requires management to estimate the amounts and timing of projected cash flows and make long-term assumptions about inflation rates and (iv)
changes in estimates used in determining our environmental obligations could have a significant impact on our results of operations.
we perform a comprehensive annual review of our environmental obligations and also review changes in facts and circumstances associated with these obligations at least quarterly. judgments and estimates are based upon currently available facts, existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, remediation experience, whether we are a potentially responsible party (prp), the ability of other prps to pay their allocated portions and take into consideration reasonably possible outcomes. our cost estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination, updated cost assumptions
(including increases and decreases to cost estimates), changes in the anticipated scope and timing of remediation activities, the settlement of environmental matters, required remediation methods and actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties.
asset retirement obligations refer to notes 1 and 12, and item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2023, for further discussion of reclamation and closure costs, including a summary of changes in our asset retirement obligations (aros) for the three years ended december 31, 2023.
we record the fair value of our estimated aros associated with tangible long-lived assets in the period incurred.
fair value is measured as the present value of cash flow estimates after considering inflation and a market risk premium. our cost estimates are reflected on a third-party cost basis and comply with our legal obligation to retire tangible long-lived assets in the period incurred. these cost estimates may differ from financial assurance cost estimates for reclamation activities because of a variety of factors, including obtaining updated cost estimates for reclamation activities, the timing of reclamation activities, changes in scope and the exclusion of certain costs not considered reclamation and closure costs. at december 31, 2023, aros recorded in our consolidated balance sheet totaled $3.0 billion.
generally, aro activities are specified by regulations or in permits issued by the relevant governing authority, and management's judgment is required to estimate the extent and timing of expenditures. accounting for aros

table of contents represents a critical accounting estimate because (i) we will not incur most of these costs for a number of years, requiring us to make estimates over a long period, (ii) reclamation and closure laws and regulations could change in the future and/or circumstances affecting our operations could change, either of which could result in significant changes to our current plans, (iii) our commitment to implement the global industry standard on tailings management could result in changes to our plans and the scope of work required, (iv) the methods used or required to plug and abandon non-producing oil and gas wellbores, remove platforms, tanks, production equipment and flow lines, and restore the wellsite could change, (v) calculating the fair value of our aros requires management to estimate projected cash flows, make long-term assumptions about inflation rates, determine our credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rates and determine market risk premiums that are appropriate for our operations and (vi) given the magnitude of our estimated reclamation, mine closure and wellsite abandonment and restoration costs, changes in any or all of these estimates could have a significant impact on our results of operations.
mineral reserves refer to note 17, and items 1. and 2. "business and properties" and item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2023, for further information regarding, and risks associated with, our estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves.
recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves were determined from the application of relevant modifying factors to geological data, in order to establish an operational, economically viable mine plan, and have been prepared in accordance with the disclosure requirements of subpart 1300 of u.s. securities and exchange commission regulation s-k. the determination of mineral reserves involves numerous uncertainties with respect to the ultimate geology of the ore bodies, including quantities, grades and recoveries. estimating the quantity and grade of mineral reserves requires us to determine the size, shape and depth of our ore bodies by analyzing geological data, such as samplings of drill holes, tunnels and other underground workings. in addition to the geology of our mines, assumptions are required to determine the economic feasibility of mining these reserves, including estimates of future commodity prices, the mining methods we use and the related costs incurred to develop and mine our mineral reserves. our estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves are prepared by and are the responsibility of our employees. these estimates are reviewed and verified regularly by independent experts in mining, geology and reserve determination.
our estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves at december 31, 2023, were determined using metal price assumptions of $3.00 per pound of copper, $1,500 per ounce of gold and $12.00 per pound of molybdenum. the following table summarizes changes in our estimated consolidated recoverable proven and probable copper, gold and molybdenum mineral reserves during 2023:

2023a a. includes estimated recoverable metals contained in stockpiles. see below for additional discussion of recoverable copper in stockpiles.
b. primarily reflects the impact of higher cost assumptions in north america and south america and mine redesigns and recovery changes at the grasberg minerals district.
as discussed in note 1, we depreciate our life-of-mine mining and milling assets and values assigned to proven and probable mineral reserves using the unit-of-production (uop) method based on our estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves. because the economic assumptions used to estimate mineral reserves may change from period to period and additional geological data is generated during the course of operations, estimates of mineral reserves may change, which could have a significant impact on our results of operations, including changes to prospective depreciation rates and impairments of long-lived asset carrying values. based on projected copper sales volumes, if estimated copper reserves at our mines were 10% higher at december 31, 2023, we estimate that our annual depreciation, depletion and amortization (dd&a) expense for 2024 would decrease by approximately $56 million
(approximately $24 million to net income attributable to common stock), and a 10% decrease in copper reserves would increase dd&a expense by approximately $219 million (approximately $73 million to net income attributable to common stock). we perform annual assessments of our existing assets in connection with the review of mine operating and development plans. if it is determined that assigned asset lives do not reflect the expected remaining period of benefit, any change could affect prospective dd&a rates.
84
table of contents as discussed below, we review and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable, and changes to our estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves could have an impact on our assessment of asset recoverability.
recoverable copper in stockpiles refer to note 1 for further discussion of our accounting policy for recoverable copper in stockpiles, including adjustments to stockpile inventory volumes.
we record, as inventory, applicable costs for copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles that are expected to be processed in the future based on proven processing technologies. mill and leach stockpiles are evaluated periodically to ensure that they are stated at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable value.
accounting for recoverable copper from mill and leach stockpiles represents a critical accounting estimate because
(i) it is impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count, thus requiring management to employ reasonable estimation methods and (ii) recoveries from leach stockpiles can vary significantly.
at december 31, 2023, estimated consolidated recoverable copper was 1.5 billion pounds in leach stockpiles (with a carrying value of $2.3 billion) and 0.3 billion pounds in mill stockpiles (with a carrying value of $0.5 billion).
impairment of long-lived mining assets refer to note 1, and item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2023, for further information regarding, and risks associated with, impairment of long-lived mining assets.
we assess the carrying values of our long-lived mining assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. in evaluating our long-lived mining assets for recoverability, we use estimates of pre-tax undiscounted future cash flows of our mines.
estimates of future cash flows are derived from current business plans, which are developed using near-term metal price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and management's projections for long-term average metal prices. in addition to near- and long-term metal price assumptions, other key assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; proven and probable mineral reserves estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the mineral reserves; value beyond proven and probable mineral reserve estimates; and the use of appropriate discount rates in the measurement of fair value. we believe our estimates and models used to determine fair value are similar to what a market participant would use. as quoted market prices are unavailable for our individual mining operations, fair value is determined through the use of after-tax discounted estimated future cash flows.
during the two-year period ended december 31, 2023, no material impairments of our long-lived mining assets were recorded.
in addition to decreases in future metal price assumptions, other events that could result in future impairment of our long-lived mining assets include, but are not limited to, decreases in estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves and any event that might otherwise have a material adverse effect on mine site production levels or costs.

sales volumes . copper and gold sales volumes were lower in 2023, compared to 2022, primarily reflecting impacts of lower ore grades at north america copper mines and the deferral of sales recognition related to the pt smelting tolling arrangement, partly offset by an increase in mining and milling rates and ore grades at indonesia mining and south america mines. refer to "operations" for further discussion of sales volumes at our mining operations.
realized prices . our consolidated revenues can vary significantly as a result of fluctuations in the market prices of copper, gold and molybdenum. in 2023, our average realized prices, compared with 2022, were 1% lower for copper,
10% higher for gold and 32% higher for molybdenum.
substantially all of our copper concentrate and some cathode sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date). we record revenues and invoice customers at the time of shipment based on then-current lme prices, which results in an embedded derivative on provisionally priced concentrate and cathode sales that is adjusted to fair value through earnings each period, using the period-end forward prices, until final pricing on the date of settlement. to the extent final prices are higher or lower than what was recorded on a provisional basis, an increase or decrease to revenues is recorded each reporting period until the date of final pricing. accordingly, in times of rising copper prices, our revenues benefit from adjustments to the final pricing of provisionally priced sales pursuant to contracts entered into in prior periods; in times of falling copper prices, the opposite occurs.
consolidated revenues include net unfavorable adjustments to current year provisionally priced copper sales ( i.e., provisionally priced sales during the years 2023 and 2022) totaling $86 million for 2023 and $539 million for 2022.
see below for discussion of adjustments related to prior year provisionally priced copper sales.
prior year provisionally priced copper sales . net favorable adjustments to prior years' provisionally priced copper sales ( i.e., provisionally priced copper sales at december 31, 2022 and 2021) recorded in consolidated revenues totaled $183 million in 2023 and $60 million in 2022. refer to "disclosures about market risks - commodity price risk" for further discussion of our provisionally priced copper sales, and to note 14 for a summary of total adjustments to prior period and current period provisionally priced copper sales.
at december 31, 2023, we had provisionally priced copper sales totaling 223 million pounds of copper (net of intercompany sales and noncontrolling interests) recorded at an average price of $3.87 per pound, subject to final pricing over the next several months. we estimate that each $0.05 change in the price realized from the december
31, 2023, recorded provisional price would have an approximate $22 million effect on 2024 revenues ($7
87
table of contents million to net income attributable to common stock). the lme copper price settled at $3.86 per pound on january 31,
2024.
atlantic copper revenues . higher atlantic copper revenues in 2023, compared with 2022, primarily reflects higher sales volumes, mostly because of reduced operations during 2022 associated with a scheduled major maintenance turnaround.
purchased copper . lower revenues associated with purchased copper in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily reflects lower volumes. we purchased copper cathode primarily for processing by our rod & refining operations, totaling 103
million pounds in 2023 and 124 million pounds in 2022.
treatment charges . revenues from our concentrate sales are recorded net of treatment charges ( i.e., fees paid to smelters that are generally negotiated annually), which will vary with the sales volumes and the price of copper.
treatment charges in 2023 compared to 2022 reflect higher rates for cerro verde and pt-fi's copper concentrates, partly offset by the elimination of treatment charges for pt-fi's copper concentrates smelted by pt smelting. as discussed in note 3, pt-fi's commercial arrangement with pt smelting changed from a copper concentrate sales agreement to a tolling arrangement and, as a result, beginning in 2023, costs incurred under the tolling arrangement are recorded as production costs in the consolidated statements of income.
royalties and export duties . royalties are primarily on pt-fi sales and vary with the volume of metal sold and the prices of copper and gold. in late 2022, the export duty rate on pt-fi's sales declined from 5% to 2.5% as a result of smelter development progress, and effective march 29, 2023, export duties were eliminated upon verification by the indonesia government that construction progress of the manyar smelter exceeded 50%. subsequently, in july 2023, the indonesia government issued a revised regulation on duties for various exported products, including copper concentrates, and under the revised regulation, pt-fi was assessed export duties for copper concentrates at 7.5%
during the second-half of 2023. refer to "operations - indonesia mining" for further discussion of the current progress of additional smelting and refining capacity in indonesia and to note 13 for discussion of pt-fi's royalties and export duties.
production and delivery costs consolidated production and delivery costs totaled $13.6 billion in 2023, compared with $13.1 billion in 2022.
higher consolidated production and delivery costs in 2023 primarily reflected increased consolidated operating rates, higher commodity-related costs across our operations and increased costs of labor (including contract labor), particularly in north america. partly offsetting these higher costs was an adjustment of $112 million recorded in 2023 to correct certain inputs in the historical pt-fi aro model. additionally, in 2022, pt-fi recorded charges of $116 million for aro adjustments (refer to note 12). refer to note 16 for details of production and delivery costs by operating segment.
mining unit site production and delivery costs per pound . site production and delivery costs for our copper mining operations primarily include labor, energy and commodity-based inputs, such as sulfuric acid, reagents, liners, tires and explosives. consolidated unit site production and delivery costs (before net noncash and other costs) for our copper mines averaged $2.36 per pound of copper in 2023 and $2.19 per pound in 2022. refer to "operations -
unit net cash costs" for further discussion of unit net cash costs associated with our operating divisions, and to
"product revenues and production costs" for reconciliations of per pound costs by operating division to production and delivery costs applicable to sales reported in our consolidated financial statements.
our copper mining operations require significant amounts of energy, principally diesel, electricity, coal and natural gas, most of which is obtained from third parties under long-term contracts. our take-or-pay contractual obligations for electricity totaled approximately $0.3 billion at december 31, 2023. we do not have take-or-pay contractual obligations for other energy commodities. energy represented 19% of our copper mine site operating costs in 2023, including purchases of approximately 250 million gallons of diesel fuel; approximately 8,650
gigawatt hours of electricity at our north america and south america copper mining operations (we generate all of our power at our indonesia mining operation); approximately 700 thousand metric tons of coal for our coal power plant in indonesia; and approximately 2 million mmbtu (million british thermal units) of natural gas at certain of our north america mines. based on current cost estimates, energy will approximate 20% of our copper mine site operating costs for 2024.
88
table of contents depreciation, depletion and amortization depreciation will vary under the uop method as a result of changes in sales volumes and the related uop rates at our mining operations. consolidated dd&a totaled $2.1 billion in 2023 and $2.0 billion in 2022. our consolidated dd&a is estimated to approximate $2.4 billion for the year 2024, based on current sales volume estimates.
environmental obligations and shutdown costs environmental obligation costs reflect net revisions to our long-term environmental obligations, which vary from period to period because of changes to environmental laws and regulations, the settlement of environmental matters and/or circumstances affecting our operations that could result in significant changes in our estimates (refer to
"critical accounting estimates - environmental obligations" for further discussion). shutdown costs include care-
and-maintenance costs and any litigation, remediation or related expenditures associated with closed facilities or operations.
net charges for environmental obligations and shutdown costs totaled $319 million in 2023, including $195 million in net adjustments to environmental obligations and $65 million associated with an adjustment to the proposed settlement of talc-related litigation. net charges for the year 2022 totaled $121 million, including $43 million in net adjustments to environmental obligations and $44 million for a proposed settlement related to historical environmental litigation. refer to note 12 for further discussion of environmental obligations and litigation matters.
net gain on early extinguishment of debt net gain on early extinguishment of debt totaled $10 million in 2023 and $31 million in 2022, primarily associated with senior note purchases. the year 2022 also includes a charge of $10 million associated with the repayment of the pt-fi term loan. refer to note 8 for further discussion.
interest expense, net consolidated interest costs (before capitalization) totaled $782 million in 2023 and $710 million in 2022. higher interest costs (before capitalization) in 2023, compared to 2022, reflect higher interest costs at pt-fi, partly offset by the impact of lower average outstanding debt because of the repayment of our 3.875% senior notes in march
2023 and open-market purchases of certain of our senior notes. refer to note 8 for further discussion of our debt.
additionally, interest expense for 2023 includes charges totaling $74 million for cerro verde's contested tax rulings issued by the peruvian supreme court.
capitalized interest totaled $267 million in 2023 and $150 million in 2022. the increase in capitalized interest in
2023, compared with 2022, is primarily associated with development activities related to the indonesia smelter projects. refer to "operations" and "capital resources and liquidity - investing activities" for further discussion of current development projects.
other income (expense), net other income (expense), net, of $286 million in 2023 was higher than $207 million in 2022, primarily reflecting higher interest income. additionally, other income (expense), net included penalties totaling $69 million in 2023
associated with cerro verde's contested tax rulings issued by the peruvian supreme court, and credits totaling $76
million in 2022 associated with adjustments to penalties on historical contested tax matters in indonesia.

d. includes net charges associated with interest and penalties on cerro verde's contested tax rulings issued by the peruvian supreme court totaling $142 million ($73 million net of noncontrolling interests).
assuming achievement of current sales volume and cost estimates and average prices of $3.75 per pound for copper,
$2,000 per ounce for gold and $19.00 per pound for molybdenum for 2024, we estimate our consolidated effective tax rate for the year 2024 would approximate 40%. the estimated consolidated effective tax rate is expected to decrease with higher copper prices. changes in projected sales volumes and average prices during 2024 would incur tax impacts at estimated effective rates of 39% for peru, 36% for indonesia and 0% for the u.s., which excludes any impact from the act. our projected estimated effective tax rate of 0% for the u.s. for the year 2024 may be adjusted as additional guidance is released by the treasury on key provisions of the act.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests refer to note 16 for net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for each of our business segments.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, which is primarily associated with pt-fi, cerro verde and el abra, totaled $1.9 billion in 2023 and $1.0 billion in 2022 (which represented 32% and 15%, respectively, of our consolidated net income before income taxes). the increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the change in our economic interest in pt-fi, which is 48.76%, compared to approximately 81% prior to january 1, 2023. net income in 2023 also included a $35 million net benefit associated with pt-fi sales volumes that were attributed to us at our previous approximate 81% economic ownership interest (refer to note 3).
based on achievement of current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming average prices of $3.75 per pound of copper, $2,000 per ounce of gold and $19.00 per pound of molybdenum, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is estimated to approximate $2.1 billion for the year 2024 (which represents 36% of our estimated consolidated net income before income taxes). the actual amount of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests will depend on many factors, including relative performance of each business segment, commodity prices, costs and other factors. refer to note 3 for ownership in our subsidiaries.
operations responsible production refer to item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december
31, 2023, for discussion of environmental (including climate), social and governance (esg) related risks.
the copper mark . we demonstrate our responsible production performance through the copper mark, a comprehensive assurance framework developed specifically for the copper industry, and recently extended to other metals including molybdenum. to achieve the copper mark, each site is required to complete an independent external assurance process to assess conformance with 33 esg criteria. awarded sites must be revalidated every three years. we have achieved the copper mark and/or molybdenum mark, as applicable, at all of our sites globally.
90
table of contents icmm . we are a founding member of the international council on mining & metals (icmm), an organization dedicated to a safe, fair and sustainable mining and metals industry, aiming continuously to strengthen esg performance across the global mining and metals industry. as a member company, we are required to implement the 10 mining principles that define good esg practices, and associated position statements, while also meeting 39 performance expectations and producing an externally verified sustainability report utilizing the global reporting initiative sustainability reporting standards subject to the icmm assurance & validation procedure.
2022 annual report on sustainability . in april 2023, we published our 2022 annual report on sustainability marking our 22nd year of reporting on our sustainability progress. we are committed to building upon our achievements in sustainability and our position as a leading responsible copper producer.
2022 climate report . in september 2023, we published our annual climate report detailing our ongoing progress to advance our climate strategy focused on reducing our greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, enhancing our resilience to climate risks and contributing responsibly produced copper to the global economy. we have four 2030 ghg emissions reduction targets that collectively cover nearly 100% of our scope 1 and 2 ghg emissions.
leaching innovation initiatives we are advancing a series of initiatives across our north america and south america operations to incorporate new applications, technologies and data analytics to our leaching processes. these leach innovation initiatives are providing opportunities to produce incremental copper from our large existing leach stockpiles. initial results are providing incremental low-cost additions to our expected annual production and the potential to add to our reserve profile. incremental copper production from these initiatives totaled 144 million pounds for the year 2023, and in fourth-quarter 2023 we achieved our initial run rate target of approximately 200 million pounds of copper per year.
we are pursuing opportunities to apply recent operational enhancements at a larger scale and are testing new technology applications that we believe have the potential for significant increases in recoverable metal beyond the initial annual run rate target.
feasibility and optimization studies we are engaged in various studies associated with potential future expansion projects primarily at our mining operations. the costs for these studies are charged to production and delivery costs as incurred and totaled $185
million for 2023 and $139 million for 2022. we estimate the costs of these studies will approximate $200 million for the year 2024.
north america copper mines we operate seven open-pit copper mines in north america - morenci, bagdad, safford (including lone star), sierrita and miami in arizona, and chino and tyrone in new mexico. all of the north america mining operations are wholly owned, except for morenci. we record our 72% undivided joint venture interest in morenci using the proportionate consolidation method.
the north america copper mines include open-pit mining, sulfide-ore concentrating, leaching and solution extraction/electrowinning (sx/ew) operations. a majority of the copper produced at our north america copper mines is cast into copper rod by our rod & refining segment. the remainder of our north america copper production is sold as copper cathode or copper concentrate, a portion of which is shipped to atlantic copper (our wholly owned smelter). molybdenum concentrate, gold and silver are also produced by certain of our north america copper mines .
development activities . we have substantial reserves and future opportunities in the u.s., primarily associated with existing mining operations.
we have a potential expansion project to more than double the concentrator capacity of the bagdad operation in northwest arizona. bagdad's reserve life currently exceeds 80 years and supports an expanded operation. in late
2023, we completed technical and economic studies, which indicated the opportunity to construct new concentrating facilities to expand capacity from 77,000 metric tons of ore per day to between 165,000 to 185,000 metric tons of ore per day. estimated incremental project capital costs approximate $3.5 billion (excluding infrastructure that would be required in the long-range plans) and is expected to increase production by approximately 200-250 million pounds of copper per year, which would more than double bagdad's current production. expanded operations also are expected to provide improved efficiency and reduce unit net cash costs through economies of scale. project economics indicate that the expansion would require an incentive copper price in the range of $3.50 to $4.00 per pound and would require approximately three to four years to complete. the decision to proceed and timing of the potential expansion will take into account overall copper market conditions, availability of labor and other factors,
91
table of contents including progress on conversion of the existing haul truck fleet to autonomous and expanding housing alternatives to support long-range plans. in parallel, we are advancing activities for expanded tailings infrastructure projects required under long-range plans in order to advance the potential construction timeline. refer to item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2023, for further discussion.
we continue to advance plans at safford/lone star to increase volumes to achieve 300 million pounds of copper per year from oxide ores, which reflects expansion of the initial design capacity of 200 million pounds of copper per year. positive drilling conducted in recent years indicates opportunities to expand production to include sulfide ores in the future. we are completing metallurgical testing and mine development planning and expect to commence pre-feasibility studies during 2024 for a potential significant expansion.

a. refer to "consolidated results" for our consolidated molybdenum sales volumes, which include sales of molybdenum produced at the north america copper mines.
our consolidated copper production and sales volumes from the north america copper mines in 2023 were below 2022
volumes, primarily reflecting lower ore grades associated with the morenci and safford mines, partly offset by leach recovery initiatives and higher mining and milling rates. we are pursuing a number of initiatives to enhance productivity and improve equipment reliability to offset declines in ore grades. we are also reviewing cost performance and evaluating the costs and benefits of adjusting mining and milling rates at morenci.
north america copper sales are estimated to approximate 1.3 billion pounds in 2024. refer to "outlook" for projected molybdenum sales volumes.
unit net cash costs . we believe unit net cash costs per pound of copper is a measure that provides investors with information about the cash-generating capacity of our mining operations expressed on a basis relating to the primary metal product for our respective operations. we use this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance by our mining operations. this information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with u.s. gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with u.s. gaap. this measure is presented by other metals mining companies, although our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

b. includes charges totaling $0.08 per pound of copper in 2023 and $0.06 per pound of copper in 2022 for feasibility and optimization studies.
our north america copper mines have varying cost structures because of differences in ore grades and characteristics, processing costs, by-product credits and other factors. average unit net cash costs (net of by-
product credits) for the north america copper mines of $2.63 per pound of copper in 2023 were higher than average unit net cash costs of $2.35 per pound of copper in 2022, primarily reflecting lower volumes and increased costs of labor (including contract labor) and maintenance and supplies, partly offset by higher molybdenum by-product credits and lower energy costs.
because certain assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis, north america's average unit depreciation rate may vary with asset additions and the level of copper production and sales.
revenue adjustments primarily result from changes in prices on provisionally priced copper sales recognized in prior periods. refer to "consolidated results - revenues" for further discussion of adjustments to prior period provisionally priced copper sales.
average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for the north america copper mines are expected to approximate $2.89 per pound of copper for the year 2024, based on achievement of current sales volume and cost estimates and assuming an average price of $19.00 per pound of molybdenum. north america's average unit net cash costs for the year 2024 would change by approximately $0.04 per pound for each $2 per pound change in the average price of molybdenum.

table of contents south america mining we operate two copper mines in south america - cerro verde in peru (in which we own a 53.56% interest) and el abra in chile (in which we own a 51% interest), which are consolidated in our financial statements.
south america mining includes open-pit mining, sulfide-ore concentrating, leaching and sx/ew operations. production from our south america mines is sold as copper concentrate or cathode under long-term contracts. our south america mines also sell a portion of their copper concentrate production to atlantic copper. in addition to copper, the cerro verde mine produces molybdenum concentrate and silver.
development activities . at the el abra operations in chile, we have identified a large sulfide resource that would support a potential major mill project similar to the large-scale concentrator at cerro verde. technical and economic studies continue to be evaluated to determine the optimal scope and timing for the sulfide project.
capital cost requirements are being updated to reflect current market conditions. we are evaluating water infrastructure alternatives to provide options to extend existing operations and support a future expansion, while continuing to monitor chile's regulatory and fiscal matters, as well as trends in capital costs for similar projects. in parallel, as part of the permitting process for the potential expansion, we are planning for a potential submission of an environmental impact statement during 2025, subject to ongoing stakeholder engagement and economic evaluations.

a. refer to "consolidated results" for our consolidated molybdenum sales volumes, which include sales of molybdenum produced at cerro verde.
our consolidated copper production and sales volumes from south america mining for the year 2023 were higher than the year 2022, primarily reflecting an increase in mining and milling rates and ore grades, partly offset by lower recovery rates. projected copper sales volumes of 1.1 billion in 2024 from south america mining reflect expected lower ore grades at cerro verde, but assume no significant impacts to water availability, which is being monitored closely in light of ongoing el niño weather patterns. refer to "outlook" for projected molybdenum sales volumes.
unit net cash costs . we believe unit net cash costs per pound of copper is a measure that provides investors with information about the cash-generating capacity of our mining operations expressed on a basis relating to the primary metal product for our respective operations. we use this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance by our mining operations. this information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with u.s. gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with u.s. gaap. this measure is presented by other metals mining companies, although our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

our south america mines have varying cost structures because of differences in ore grades and characteristics, processing costs, by-product credits and other factors. average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for south america mining of $2.38 per pound of copper in 2023 were higher than average unit net cash costs of $2.34 per pound in 2022, primarily reflecting increased costs of maintenance and supplies and higher treatment charges, partly offset by higher volumes and molybdenum by-product credits.
revenues from cerro verde's concentrate sales are recorded net of treatment charges, which will vary with cerro verde's sales volumes and the price of copper. higher treatment charges in 2023, compared to 2022, reflected higher smelting and refining rates.
because certain assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis, south america's unit depreciation rate may vary with asset additions and the level of copper production and sales.
revenue adjustments primarily result from changes in prices on provisionally priced copper sales recognized in prior periods. refer to "consolidated results - revenues" for further discussion of adjustments to prior period provisionally priced copper sales.
average unit net cash costs (net of by-product credits) for south america mining are expected to approximate $2.37

indonesia mining pt-fi operates one of the world's largest copper and gold mines at the grasberg minerals district in central papua, indonesia. pt-fi produces copper concentrate that contains significant quantities of gold and silver. we have a
48.76% ownership interest in pt-fi and manage its mining operations. pt-fi's results are consolidated in our financial statements. prior to january 1, 2023, our ownership interest in pt-fi approximated 81%.
other than copper concentrate delivered to pt smelting for further processing into refined products, most of pt-
fi's copper concentrate is sold under long-term contracts.

table of contents regulatory matters . over the past several years, the indonesia government has enacted various laws and regulations to promote downstream processing of various products, including copper concentrates. in 2018, pt-fi agreed to expand its domestic smelting and refining capacity and has made substantial progress towards completion. at year-
end 2023, progress of these projects was measured at over 90% (refer to "indonesia smelting and refining" below).
in july 2023, pt-fi was granted an export license for copper concentrate, and in december 2023, pt-fi was granted an export license for anode slimes, each for the export of specified quantities of concentrate and anode slimes and valid through may 2024. pt-fi and the indonesia government are completing administrative processes to update quotas for estimated concentrate and anode slimes exports through may 2024.
pt-fi is working with the indonesia government to obtain approvals to continue exports of copper concentrates and anode slimes subsequent to may 2024 until the indonesia smelter projects are fully commissioned and reach designed operating conditions.
refer to notes 12 and 13 for further discussion of indonesia regulatory matters and export duties being assessed at pt-fi under revised regulations.
mining rights . given the long-term nature of planning for mining investments, the indonesia government is updating regulations that would enable pt-fi to apply for an extension of its special mining license (iupk) beyond 2041. an extension would enable continuity of large-scale operations for the benefit of all stakeholders and provide growth options through additional resource development opportunities in the highly attractive grasberg minerals district.
operating and development activities . over a multi-year investment period, pt-fi has successfully commissioned three large-scale underground mines in the grasberg minerals district (grasberg block cave, deep mill level zone
(dmlz) and big gossan), which provided production volumes of 1.7 billion pounds of copper and 2.0 million ounces of gold for the year 2023. milling rates for ore from these underground mines averaged 198,300 metric tons of ore per day in 2023, an approximate 3% increase from 192,600 metric tons of ore per day in 2022. during 2023, pt-fi set a number of annual operating records, including total underground ore mined (and milled) and volume of concentrate produced.
in december 2023, pt-fi completed the installation of new milling facilities, which will enable pt-fi to further leverage the success of the underground mines and provide sustained large-scale production volumes. pt-fi is also advancing a mill recovery project with the installation of a new copper cleaner circuit that is expected to be completed in the second half of 2024 to provide incremental production of approximately 60 million pounds of copper and 40 thousand ounces of gold per year.
pt-fi is advancing plans to transition its existing energy source from coal to liquefied natural gas, which is expected to meaningfully reduce pt-fi's scope 1 ghg emissions at the grasberg minerals district. the project includes investments in a new gas-fired combined cycle facility. capital expenditures for the new facilities, to be incurred over the next four years, approximate $1 billion, which represents an incremental cost of $0.4 billion compared to previously planned investments to refurbish the existing coal units.
kucing liar . long-term mine development activities are ongoing for pt-fi's kucing liar deposit in the grasberg minerals district, which is expected to produce over 7 billion pounds of copper and 6 million ounces of gold between 2029 and the end of 2041. an extension of pt-fi's operating rights beyond 2041 would extend the life of the project. pre-production development activities commenced in 2022 and are expected to continue over an approximate
10-year timeframe. capital investments are estimated to average approximately $400 million per year over this period. at full operating rates of approximately 90,000 metric tons of ore per day, annual production from kucing liar is expected to approximate 560 million pounds of copper and 520 thousand ounces of gold, providing pt-fi with sustained long-term, large-scale and low-cost production. kucing liar will benefit from substantial shared infrastructure and pt-fi's experience and long-term success in block-cave mining.
96
table of contents indonesia smelting and refining . in connection with pt-fi's 2018 agreement with the indonesia government to secure the extension of its long-term mining rights, pt-fi agreed to expand its domestic smelting and refining capacity.
at the end of 2023, progress of the indonesia smelter projects exceeded 90%. pt-fi is actively engaged in the following projects for additional domestic smelting and refining capacity:
• in december 2023, pt smelting commissioned the expansion of its capacity by 30% to 1.3 million metric tons of copper concentrate per year. the project was successfully completed on time and within budget. the project was funded by pt-fi with borrowings totaling approximately $250 million that will convert to equity in 2024, increasing pt-fi's ownership in pt smelting to approximately 65% from 39.5%.
• construction progress of the manyar smelter in gresik, indonesia (with a capacity to process approximately 1.7
million metric tons of copper concentrate per year) is advancing on schedule with a target of may 2024 for mechanical completion, followed by a ramp-up period through december 2024. construction of the smelter has an estimated cost of $3.0 billion, including $2.8 billion for a construction contract (excluding capitalized interest, owner's costs and commissioning) and $0.2 billion for investment in a desalination plant.
• the pmr is being constructed to process gold and silver from the manyar smelter and pt smelting. construction is in progress with commissioning expected during 2024. current cost estimates for the pmr total $665 million.
capital expenditures for the indonesia smelter projects totaled $1.7 billion for the year 2023 and are expected to approximate $1.0 billion for the year 2024. projected capital expenditures for the indonesia smelter projects in
2024 exclude capitalized interest and $0.3 billion of estimated commissioning and owner's costs. capital expenditures for the indonesia smelter projects are being funded with the remaining proceeds from pt-fi's senior notes and availability under its revolving credit facility. start-up costs for the indonesia smelter projects are expected to total $0.2 billion in 2024.

lower consolidated sales of 1.5 billion pounds of copper and 1.7 million ounces of gold in 2023, compared with 1.6
billion pounds of copper and 1.8 million ounces of gold in 2022, primarily reflect the deferral of sales recognition related to the pt smelting tolling arrangement. lower gold sales volumes in 2023, compared to 2022, also reflect
97
table of contents the timing of shipments of anode slimes associated with a change in administrative requirements for products that were previously being exported by pt smelting.
consolidated sales volumes from pt-fi are expected to approximate 1.7 billion pounds of copper and 2.0 million ounces of gold for the year 2024. for the year 2024, consolidated copper production volumes from pt-fi are expected to exceed its consolidated sales volumes, reflecting the deferral of approximately 90 million pounds of copper that will be processed by the manyar smelter and sold as refined metal in future periods.

a. includes charges totaling $0.02 per pound of copper for feasibility and optimization studies.
b. includes (credits) charges associated with aro adjustments totaling $(0.07) per pound of copper in 2023 and
$0.07 per pound of copper in 2022.
a significant portion of pt-fi's costs are fixed and unit costs vary depending on volumes and other factors. pt-
fi's unit net cash costs (net of gold, silver and other by-product credits) of $0.10 per pound of copper in 2023
were higher than the unit net cash costs of $0.09 per pound of copper in 2022, primarily reflecting higher treatment charges , partly offset by higher gold, silver and other by-product credits.
treatment charges vary with the volume of metals sold and the price of copper. the increase in treatment charges per pound of copper and ounce of gold in 2023, compared with 2022, reflects higher costs associated with the new tolling arrangement with pt smelting compared to the previous copper concentrate sales agreement. tolling costs
98
table of contents paid to pt smelting are recorded as production costs in the consolidated statements of income but are reflected as treatment costs above in our unit net cash costs presentation.
pt-fi's export duties totaled $324 million in 2023 and $307 million in 2022. refer to note 13 for further discussion of pt-fi's export duties under its iupk and amounts being assessed under a revised regulation.
pt-fi's royalties vary with the volume of metal sold and the prices of copper and gold. pt-fi's royalties totaled
$338 million in 2023 and $357 million in 2022.
because certain assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis, pt-fi's unit depreciation rate may vary with asset additions and the level of copper production and sales.
revenue adjustments primarily result from changes in prices on provisionally priced copper sales recognized in prior periods. refer to "consolidated results - revenues" for further discussion of adjustments to prior period provisionally priced copper sales.
pt smelting intercompany profit represents the change in the deferral of 39.5% of pt-fi's profit on sales to pt smelting. as discussed in note 3, beginning in 2023, pt-fi's commercial arrangement with pt smelting changed from a copper concentrate sales agreement to a tolling arrangement and there will be no further sales from pt-fi to pt smelting.
average unit net cash costs (net of gold, silver and other by-product credits) for pt-fi are expected to approximate $0.09 per pound of copper for the year 2024, based on achievement of current sales volumes and cost estimates and assuming an average price of $2,000 per ounce of gold. pt-fi's estimated unit net cash costs for the year 2024 include assessment of export duties of $0.27 per pound of copper (see note 13 for discussion of export duties being assessed under a revised regulation). pt-fi's average unit net cash costs for the year 2024 would change by approximately $0.10 per pound of copper for each $100 per ounce change in the average price of gold.
pt-fi's projected sales volumes and unit net cash costs for the year 2024 are dependent on operational performance;
extension of pt-fi's export permits for copper concentrates and anode slimes beyond may 2024; weather-related conditions; and other factors. refer to "cautionary statement" below, and item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2023, for further discussion of factors that could cause results to differ materially from projections.
molybdenum mines we operate two wholly owned molybdenum mines in colorado - the climax open-pit mine and the henderson underground mine. the climax and henderson mines produce high-purity, chemical-grade molybdenum concentrate, which is typically further processed into value-added molybdenum chemical products. the majority of the molybdenum concentrate produced at the climax and henderson mines, as well as from our north america and south america copper mines, is processed at our conversion facilities operating activities . production from the molybdenum mines totaled 30 million pounds of molybdenum in 2023 and 33
million pounds in 2022. refer to "consolidated results" for our consolidated molybdenum operating data, which includes sales of molybdenum produced at our molybdenum mines and from our north america and south america copper mines. refer to "outlook" for projected consolidated molybdenum sales volumes.
unit net cash costs per pound of molybdenum . we believe unit net cash costs per pound of molybdenum is a measure that provides investors with information about the cash-generating capacity of our mining operations expressed on a basis relating to the primary metal product for our respective operations. we use this measure for the same purpose and for monitoring operating performance by our mining operations. this information differs from measures of performance determined in accordance with u.s. gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance determined in accordance with u.s. gaap. this measure is presented by other metals mining companies, although our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
average unit net cash costs for our molybdenum mines of $15.13 per pound of molybdenum in 2023 were higher than
$11.43 per pound of molybdenum in 2022, primarily reflecting lower volumes and higher contract labor costs.
99
table of contents average unit net cash costs for the molybdenum mines are expected to approximate $14.29 per pound of molybdenum for the year 2024, based on achievement of current sales volumes and cost estimates. refer to "product revenues and production costs" for a reconciliation of unit net cash costs per pound to production and delivery costs applicable to sales reported in our consolidated financial statements.
smelting and refining through our downstream integration, we are able to assure placement of a significant portion of our copper concentrate production. we wholly own and operate the miami smelter in arizona, atlantic copper (a smelter and refinery in spain), and the el paso refinery in texas. pt-fi also has a 39.5% ownership interest in pt smelting
(refer to note 3).
in 2024, we expect to complete the indonesia smelter projects, which will smelt and refine copper concentrate from pt-fi as well as process anode slimes. as a result, pt-fi's operations will be fully integrated, and treatment charges reflecting the cost of smelting and refining operations will be recorded in production and delivery costs
(refer to "indonesia mining - indonesia smelting and refining" above). in addition, our north america copper mines are largely integrated with our miami smelter and el paso refinery.
atlantic copper's treatment charges, which consist of a base rate per pound of copper and per ounce of gold, are generally fixed and represent a cost to our mining operations and income to atlantic copper ( i.e. , higher treatment charges benefit our atlantic copper operations).
refer to items 1. and 2. "business and properties" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2023, for further information regarding our smelting and refining facilities.
we defer recognizing profits on sales from our mining operations to atlantic copper (and on 39.5% of pt-fi's sales to pt smelting for 2022) until final sales to third parties occur. changes in these deferrals attributable to variability in intercompany volumes resulted in net additions to operating income totaling $64 million ($37 million to net income attributable to common stock) in 2023 and $52 million ($33 million to net income attributable to common stock) in 2022. our net deferred profits on our inventories at atlantic copper to be recognized in future periods' net income attributable to common stock totaled $57 million at december 31, 2023. quarterly variations in ore grades, the timing of intercompany shipments and changes in product prices will result in variability in our net deferred profits and quarterly earnings.
capital resources and liquidity our consolidated operating cash flows vary with sales volumes; prices realized from copper, gold and molybdenum sales; production costs; income taxes; other working capital changes; and other factors. see "consolidated results," and item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2023, for further discussion of our energy requirements and related costs.
we remain focused on managing costs efficiently and continue to advance several important value-enhancing initiatives. we believe the actions we have taken in recent years to build a solid balance sheet, successfully expand low-cost operations and maintain flexible organic growth options while maintaining sufficient liquidity, will allow us to continue to execute our business plans in a prudent manner during periods of economic uncertainty while preserving substantial future asset values. we closely monitor market conditions and will adjust our operating plans to protect liquidity and preserve our asset values, if necessary. we expect to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position as we focus on building long-term value in our business, executing our operating plans safely, responsibly and efficiently, and prudently managing costs and capital expenditures.
based on current sales volume, cost and metal price estimates discussed in "outlook," our available cash and cash equivalents plus our projected consolidated operating cash flows of $5.8 billion for the year 2024 exceed our expected consolidated capital expenditures of $4.6 billion (which includes $2.3 billion for major mining projects and $1.0 billion for the indonesia smelter projects that are being funded with the remaining proceeds from pt-fi's senior notes and availability under its revolving credit facility). projected capital expenditures for the indonesia smelter projects in 2024 exclude capitalized interest and $0.3 billion of estimated commissioning and owner's costs.
planned capital expenditures for major mining projects over the next few years are primarily associated with underground mine development in the grasberg minerals district and potential expansion projects in north america.
100
table of contents we have cash on hand and the financial flexibility to fund capital expenditures and our other cash requirements for the next twelve months, including noncontrolling interest distributions, income tax payments, debt repayments, current common stock dividends (base and variable) and any share or debt repurchases. at december 31, 2023, we had
$4.8 billion of consolidated cash and cash equivalents (which includes $0.2 billion of cash designated for indonesia smelter projects) and fcx, pt-fi and cerro verde have $3.0 billion, $1.75 billion and $350 million, respectively, available under their revolving credit facilities. refer to "outlook" for further discussion of projected operating cash flows and capital expenditures for 2024 and to "debt" below and note 8 for further discussion.
at december 31, 2023, we had $1.2 billion in current restricted cash and cash equivalents, which includes (i) $1.1
billion associated with pt-fi's export proceeds temporarily deposited in indonesia banks in accordance with a 2023
regulation issued by the indonesia government that requires 30% of export proceeds to be temporarily deposited into indonesia banks for a period of 90 days before withdrawal, and (ii) $145 million in assurance to support pt-fi's commitment for smelter development in indonesia.
financial policy . our financial policy is aligned with our strategic objectives of maintaining a solid balance sheet, providing cash returns to shareholders and advancing opportunities for future growth. the policy includes a base dividend and a performance-based payout framework, whereby up to 50% of available cash flows generated after planned capital spending and distributions to noncontrolling interest would be allocated to shareholder returns and the balance to debt reduction and investments in value enhancing growth projects, subject to us maintaining our net debt at a level not to exceed the net debt target of $3.0 billion to $4.0 billion (excluding net project debt for the indonesia smelter projects). our board reviews the structure of the performance-based payout framework at least annually.
at december 31, 2023, our net debt, excluding net debt for the indonesia smelter projects, totaled $0.8 billion.
refer to "net debt" for further discussion.
in december 2023, our board declared cash dividends totaling $0.15 per share on our common stock (including a
$0.075 per share quarterly base cash dividend and a $0.075 per share quarterly variable, performance-based cash dividend), which was paid on february 1, 2024, to shareholders of record as of january 12, 2024. based on current market conditions, the base and variable dividends on our common stock are anticipated to total $0.60 per share for
2024 (including the dividends paid on february 1, 2024), comprised of a $0.30 per share base dividend and $0.30 per share variable dividend. the declaration and payment of dividends (base or variable) is at the discretion of our board and will depend on our financial results, cash requirements, global economic conditions and other factors deemed relevant by our board.

table of contents elected to permanently reinvest earnings from our foreign subsidiaries, and we have recorded deferred tax liabilities for foreign earnings that are available to be repatriated to the u.s. from time to time, our foreign subsidiaries distribute earnings to the u.s. through dividends that are subject to applicable withholding taxes and noncontrolling interests' share. see item 1a. "risk factors" contained in part i of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2023, for further discussion of our holding company structure and the potential impact of changes in tax laws.
debt at december 31, 2023, consolidated debt totaled $9.4 billion, with a related weighted-average interest rate of
5.2%. substantially all of our outstanding debt is fixed rate. fcx has $0.7 billion in scheduled senior note maturities in november 2024 with no further senior note maturities until 2027. our total debt has an average remaining duration of approximately 10 years. we had no borrowings and $7 million in letters of credit issued under our $3.0 billion revolving credit facility. additionally, at december 31, 2023, no amounts were drawn under pt-fi's
$1.75 billion revolving credit facility or cerro verde's $350 million revolving credit facility. refer to note 8
for further discussion of the above items and for information regarding our debt arrangements.
we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash tenders and/or exchanges for equity or debt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. such tenders, exchanges or purchases, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.
operating activities we generated consolidated operating cash flows of $5.3 billion in 2023 (net of $0.9 billion of working capital and other uses) and $5.1 billion in 2022 (net of $1.6 billion of working capital and other uses).
investing activities capital expenditures . capital expenditures, including capitalized interest, totaled $4.8 billion for the year
2023, including $1.8 billion for major mining projects primarily associated with the underground development activities in the grasberg minerals district and $1.7 billion for the indonesia smelter projects.
capital expenditures, including capitalized interest, totaled $3.5 billion for the year 2022, including $1.7
billion for major projects primarily associated with underground development activities in the grasberg minerals district and $0.8 billion for the indonesia smelter projects.
a large portion of the capital expenditures relate to projects that are expected to add significant production and cash flow in future periods, enabling us to continue to generate operating cash flows exceeding capital expenditures in future years. refer to "outlook" for further discussion of projected capital expenditures for 2024.
proceeds from sales of assets . proceeds from sales of assets for the year 2022 included $60 million from the sale of all of our shares in jervois global limited. refer to note 2 for further discussion.
loans to pt smelting for expansion . pt-fi made loans to pt smelting totaling $129 million in 2023 and $65 million in 2022 to fund pt smelting's expansion project. refer to note 3 for further discussion.
financing activities debt transactions . net debt repayments totaled $1.2 billion in 2023, including the repayment of our 3.875% senior notes that matured in march 2023 totaling $996 million and open-market purchases of our senior notes for a total cost of $221 million.
net borrowings of debt totaled $1.2 billion in 2022, including pt-fi's $3.0 billion senior notes offering, partly offset by the purchases of our senior notes in open market transactions ($1.0 billion), and the repayment of borrowings under pt-fi's term loan ($0.6 billion) and cerro verde's term loan ($0.3 billion).
refer to note 8 for further discussion.
cash dividends on common stock . we paid cash dividends on our common stock totaling $0.9 billion in 2023 and 2022.

market risks our businesses have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.
we provide traditional commercial, retail and mortgage banking services, as well as other financial services including asset management, wealth management, securities brokerage, merger-and-acquisition advisory services and other specialty table of contents financing. all of our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally or specifically in the south, midwest and texas, the principal markets in which we conduct business. a worsening of business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we conduct business could have adverse effects on our business, including the following:
•a decrease in the demand for, or the availability of, loans and other products and services offered by us, including as a result of changing interest rate conditions;
•a decrease in the value of our loans held for sale or other assets secured by consumer or commercial real estate;
•an impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill;
•a decrease in interest income from variable rate loans, due to declines in interest rates;
•an increase in the number of clients and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us, which could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provisions for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale;
•a decrease in the supply of deposits or the need to price interest-bearing deposits higher due to competitive forces, which could result in substantial increase in cost to retain and service deposits; and
•a change in the pricing or spread environment could adversely impact the yields received on newly originated loans or securities.
in the event of severely adverse business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we conduct business, there can be no assurance that the federal government and the federal reserve would intervene or make adjustments to fiscal or monetary policy that would cause business and economic conditions to improve. if business and economic conditions worsen or volatility increases, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
volatility and uncertainty related to inflation and the effects of inflation, which has led to increased costs for businesses and consumers and potentially contribute to poor business and economic conditions generally and may enhance or contribute to some of the risks of our business. for example, higher inflation, or volatility and uncertainty related to inflation, could reduce demand for our products, adversely affect the creditworthiness of the company's borrowers or result in lower values for our investment securities and other fixed-rate assets. in response to sustained inflationary pressures, the federal reserve has tightened monetary policy, as described below. to the extent these policies do not mitigate the volatility and uncertainty related to inflation and the effects of inflation, or to the extent conditions otherwise worsen, we could experience adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
fluctuations in market interest rates, including the level and shape of the yield curve, may adversely affect our performance.
our profitability depends to a large extent on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income received on interest-earning assets (primarily loans, leases, investment securities and cash balances held at the federal reserve bank) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (primarily deposits and borrowings). the level of net interest income is mostly a function of the average balance of interest-earning assets, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. these factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by external factors such as the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the fomc and interest rates markets.
the cost of our deposits and short-term wholesale borrowings is heavily impacted by market-based liquidity conditions and interest rates, factors which are influenced directly and indirectly by a mixture of effects including the fomc's monetary policy and economic conditions. moreover, the market's expectation of the future course of fomc policy and economic factors interact to influence the path for market interest rates and the shape of the yield curve. yields generated by our loans and securities and the costs of deposits and wholesale borrowings are driven by both short-term and longer-term interest rates to different degrees, thus impacting net interest income. if the yields on our interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the yields on our interest-earning assets, our net interest income may decline. our net interest income could be similarly affected if the yields on our interest-earning assets decline at a faster pace than the yields on our interest-bearing liabilities. finally, interest rate volatility and levels directly impact the value of certain fixed-rate assets and liabilities, which may impact unrealized gains or unrealized losses in our portfolios.
the monetary policy tightening cycle observed since 2022 has led to increased volatility in fixed income markets. the federal reserve increased the benchmark federal funds interest rate from near zero in early 2022 to a range between 5.25 percent and 5.50 percent with the last increase occurring at its july 26, 2023 meeting. the range of potential rate paths over the coming year is wide and will ultimately be driven by the path of inflation, labor market performance and economic growth. estimates for net interest income exposure to interest rate changes have been reduced recently. while a persistently elevated, or table of contents increasing, rate environment from current levels would continue to support net interest income, elevated rates also increase the cost of funding and competition for deposits. additionally, elevated interest rates would increase debt service requirements for some of our borrowers and may adversely affect those borrowers' ability to pay as contractually obligated, ultimately resulting in additional delinquencies or charge-offs. conversely, should interest rates move lower, net interest income is well supported by a mostly neutral interest rate risk position aided by the company's interest rate hedging program. in this environment, deposit and funding costs will move lower; however, net interest income may be adversely impacted if those costs cannot move lower as fast as expected.
sustained higher interest rates and continued federal reserve asset reductions may adversely affect market stability, market liquidity and the company's financial performance and condition. we cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary policies or the precise effects such changes may have on our activities and financial results.
for a more detailed discussion of these risks and our management strategies for these risks, see the "executive overview," "net interest income, margin and interest rate risk," "net interest income and margin," "market risk-interest rate risk" and "securities" sections of item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of this annual report on form 10-k.
transitions away from and the replacement of benchmark rates could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
certain securities within the investment portfolio, certain hedging transactions and certain of the products that we offer, such as floating-rate loans and mortgages, determine their applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate, an index, or other financial metric. libor and certain other benchmark rates have been or currently are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. all libor settings ceased to be published as of june 30, 2023. regions has adopted new products linked to alternative reference rates, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, consistent with guidance provided by u.s. regulators, arrc and gses. additionally, regions transitioned libor-based products to alternative rates that are consistent with industry standard conventions.
in the fourth quarter of 2023, bloomberg index services limited announced the permanent cessation of the bsby index and all tenors effective november 15, 2024. regions is in the process of evaluating exposure to bsby and planning for cessation.
for a more detailed discussion of our management strategies related to the libor cessation and transition, see the "libor transition and reference rate reform" section of item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of this annual report on form 10-k.
credit risks if we experience greater credit losses in our loan portfolios than anticipated, our earnings may be materially adversely affected.
as a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans and leases according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans and leases may not be sufficient to assure repayment. credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for credit losses based on a number of factors. our management periodically determines the allowance for credit losses based on available information, including the quality of the loan portfolio, the value of the underlying collateral and the level of non-accrual loans, taking into account relevant information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions that affect the collectability of our loan portfolio. if, as a result of general economic conditions, there is a decrease in asset quality or growth in the loan portfolio and management determines that additional increases in the allowance for credit losses are necessary, we may incur additional expenses which will reduce our net income, and our business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.
although our management will establish an allowance for credit losses it believes is appropriate to absorb expected credit losses over the life of loans in our loan portfolio, this allowance may not be adequate. for example, if a hurricane or other natural disaster were to occur in one of our principal markets or if economic conditions in those markets were to deteriorate unexpectedly, additional credit losses not incorporated in the existing allowance for credit losses may occur. losses in excess of the existing allowance for credit losses will reduce our net income and could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, perhaps materially.
in addition, bank regulatory agencies will periodically review our allowance for credit losses and the value attributed to non-accrual loans and to real estate acquired through foreclosure. such regulatory agencies may require us to adjust our determination of the value for these items. these adjustments could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
table of contents any future reductions in our credit ratings may increase our funding costs and place limitations on business activities.
the major ratings agencies regularly evaluate us, and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. in general, ratings agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix and level and quality of earnings, and we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings. the ratings assigned to regions and regions bank remain subject to change at any time, and it is possible that any ratings agency will take action to downgrade regions, regions bank or both in the future. additionally, ratings agencies may also make substantial changes to their ratings policies and practices, which may affect our credit ratings. in the future, changes to existing ratings guidelines and new ratings guidelines may, among other things, adversely affect the ratings of our securities or other securities in which we have an economic interest.
our credit ratings can have negative consequences that can impact our ability to access the debt and capital markets, as well as reduce our profitability through increased costs on future debt issuances. if we were to be downgraded below investment grade, we may not be able to reliably access the short-term unsecured funding markets, and certain customers could be prohibited from placing deposits with regions bank, which could cause us to hold more cash and liquid investments to meet our ongoing liquidity needs. such actions could reduce our profitability as these liquid investments earn a lower return than other assets, such as loans. see the "liquidity" section within "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of this annual report on form 10-k for our liquidity policy.
additionally, if we were to be downgraded to below investment grade, certain counterparty contracts may be required to be renegotiated or require posting of additional collateral. refer to note 20 "derivative financial instruments and hedging activities" to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form 10-k for the fair value of contracts subject to contingent credit features and the collateral postings associated with such contracts. although the exact amount of additional collateral is unknown, it is reasonable to conclude that we may be required to post additional collateral related to existing contracts with contingent credit features.
changes in the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.
adverse developments affecting the overall strength and soundness of other financial institutions, the financial services industry as a whole and the general economic climate and the u.s. treasury market could have a negative impact on perceptions about the strength and soundness of our business even if we are not subject to the same adverse developments. in addition, adverse developments with respect to third parties with whom we have important relationships could also negatively impact perceptions about us. these perceptions about us could cause our business to be negatively affected and exacerbate the other risks that we face.
regions may be impacted by actual or perceived soundness of other financial institutions, including as a result of the financial or operational failure of a major financial institution, or concerns about the creditworthiness of such a financial institution or its ability to fulfill its obligations, which can cause substantial and cascading disruption within the financial markets and increased expenses, including fdic insurance premiums, and could affect our ability to attract and retain depositors and to borrow or raise capital. for example, during 2023 the fdic took control and was appointed receiver of silicon valley bank, signature bank and first republic bank. the failure of other banks and financial institutions and the measures taken by governments, businesses and other organizations in response to these events could adversely impact regions' business, financial condition and results of operations.
regions' ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. regions has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, central counterparties, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds and other institutional investors and clients. as a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally, in the past have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by regions or by other institutions. many of these transactions expose regions to credit risk in the event of default of regions' counterparty or client. in addition, regions' credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by regions cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of regions' exposure. any such losses could materially and adversely affect regions' results of operations and financial condition.
we may suffer losses if the value of collateral declines in stressed market conditions.
during periods of market stress or illiquidity, our credit risk may be further increased when we fail to realize the fair value of the collateral we hold; collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount owed to us; or counterparties are unable to post collateral, whether for operational or other reasons. furthermore, disputes with counterparties concerning the valuation of collateral may increase in times of significant market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and we could suffer losses during these periods if we are unable to realize the fair value of collateral or to manage declines in the value of collateral.
table of contents liquidity risks ineffective liquidity management could adversely affect our financial results and condition.
effective liquidity management is essential for the operation of our business. we require sufficient liquidity to meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals, payments on our debt obligations as they come due and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and unpredictable circumstances causing industry or general financial market stress. a substantial majority of our assets are loans, which cannot necessarily be called or sold on timeframes short enough to meet these liquidity requirements.
in addition, our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy generally. factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include increases in funding costs, a downturn in the geographic markets in which our loans and operations are concentrated, difficult credit markets or unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, including as a result of unusual effects in the market. although we have historically been able to meet the liquidity needs of customers as necessary, the ability to do so is not assured, especially if a large number of our depositors seek to withdraw their accounts, regardless of the reason. a failure to maintain adequate liquidity could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
loss of deposits or a change in deposit mix could increase our funding costs.
deposits are a low cost and stable source of funding. regions competes with banks and other financial institutions for deposits and as a result, regions could lose deposits in the future, clients may shift their deposits into higher cost products or regions may need to raise interest rates to avoid deposit attrition. funding costs may also increase if deposits lost are replaced with wholesale funding. higher funding costs reduce regions' net interest margin, net interest income and net income. any of a variety of single or combined factors could contribute to adverse movement in deposits or deposit costs, including but not limited to economic uncertainty, rapid movements in market interest rates or the federal reserve's monetary policy, entrance of competitors, disruptive technology, and/or diminishment of confidence in regions or banks broadly.
we rely on the mortgage secondary market to manage various risks.
in 2023, we sold 35.1% of the mortgage loans we originated to the agencies. we rely on the agencies to purchase loans that meet their conforming loan requirements in order to reduce our credit risk and provide funding for additional loans we desire to originate. we cannot provide assurance that the agencies will not materially limit their purchases of conforming loans due to capital constraints, a change in the criteria for conforming loans or other factors. additionally, various proposals have been made to reform the u.s. residential mortgage finance market, including the role of the agencies. the exact effects of any such reforms, if implemented, are not yet known, but they may limit our ability to sell conforming loans to the agencies. if we are unable to continue to sell conforming loans to the agencies, our ability to fund, and thus originate, additional mortgage loans may be adversely affected, which would adversely affect our results of operations.
technology risks we are at risk of a variety of systems failures or errors and cyber-attacks or other similar incidents that could adversely affect customer experience and our business and financial performance.
failure or errors in or breach of our systems or networks, or those of our third-party service providers (or providers to such third-party service providers), including as a result of cybersecurity or other similar incidents, could disrupt our businesses or impact our customers. examples of incidents include, among other things, denial of service attacks, ransomware, malware, worms, software bugs, hacking, social engineering, phishing attacks, credential stuffing, account takeovers, insider threats, theft, malfeasance or improper access by employees or service providers, human error, fraud or other similar disruptions. these incidents could result in the loss, unauthorized disclosure, misuse or misappropriation of confidential, personal, proprietary or other information, damage to our reputation, increases to our costs and cause customer and financial losses. as a large financial institution, we depend on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number of customer transactions on a continuous basis and otherwise collect, transmit, store and process a significant amount of personal information in connection therewith. as public, regulatory and customers' expectations have increased regarding operational resilience and cybersecurity, our systems, networks and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures and disruptions, as well as cybersecurity or other similar incidents. our systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. for example, there could be electrical or telecommunications outages; pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts and civil unrest; and, as described below, cyber-attacks or other similar incidents. although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems or networks, or those of our third-party service providers, that support our businesses and customers.
cybersecurity risks for large financial institutions, such as us, have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of technology-based products and services and the increased sophistication and activities of organized table of contents crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, nation state-supported actors, activists and other external parties. this increase is expected to continue and further intensify. the techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched (or may evade detection for considerable time), can be initiated from a variety of sources, including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments, and may see their frequency increased, and effectiveness enhanced, by the use of artificial intelligence. these criminals may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems and networks to disclose sensitive information (including confidential, personal, proprietary and other information) in order to gain access to data or our systems and networks. third parties with whom we or our customers do business also present operational and cybersecurity risks to us, including cybersecurity or other similar incidents or failures or disruptions of their own systems and networks. while we have successfully defended similar attacks, we could become the subject of a successful similar style attack through a supply chain compromise. as noted above, our operations rely on the secure collection, transmission, storage and other processing of confidential, personal, proprietary and other information in our operating systems and networks. in addition, to access our products and services, our customers may use personal computers, smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices that are beyond our control environment. additionally, cybersecurity and other similar incidents or terrorist activities could disrupt our or our customers' or other third parties' business operations. although these past events have not resulted in a breach of our client data or account information, such attacks have adversely affected the performance of regions bank's website, www.regions.com, and, in some instances, prevented customers from accessing regions bank's secure websites for consumer and commercial applications. in all cases, the attacks primarily resulted in inconvenience; however, future cyber-attacks or other similar incidents could be more disruptive and damaging, and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks. the united states government has raised concerns about a potential increase in cyber-attacks and other similar incidents generally as a result of the military conflict between russia and ukraine and the related sanctions imposed by the united states and other countries or the ongoing israel-hamas conflict.
although we believe that we have appropriate information security procedures and controls designed to prevent or limit the effects of a cybersecurity or other similar incident, our technologies, systems, networks and our customers' devices may be the target of cybersecurity or other similar incidents that could result in the unauthorized release, accessing, gathering, monitoring, loss, destruction, modification, acquisition, transfer, use or other processing of us or our customers' confidential, personal, proprietary and other information. we also have insurance coverage, that is reviewed annually, that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain losses associated with cybersecurity and other similar incidents, but our insurer may deny coverage as to any future claim or our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses from any such attack, breach or incident, including any related damage to our reputation. in addition, given the proliferation of cyber-events in our industry, the cost of cyber insurance is expected to continue to increase and may not be available at all or on acceptable terms.
as cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. we may also be required to incur significant costs in connection with any regulatory investigation or civil litigation, fines, damages or injunctions resulting from a cybersecurity or other similar incident that impacts us. in addition, our third-party service providers may be unable to identify vulnerabilities in their systems and networks or, once identified, be unable to promptly provide required patches or other remedial measures. further, even if provided, such patches or remedial measures may not fully address any vulnerability or may be difficult for us to implement. while we perform cybersecurity diligence on our key service providers, because we do not control our service providers and our ability to monitor their cybersecurity is limited, we cannot ensure the cybersecurity measures they take will be sufficient to protect any information we share them. due to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations, we may be held responsible for cybersecurity or other similar incidents attributed to our service providers as they relate to the information we share with them.
disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems or networks that support our businesses and customers, or cybersecurity or other similar incidents of the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services, could result in customer attrition, violation of applicable privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations, notifications obligations, regulatory fines, civil litigation, damages, injunctions, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, remediation costs, additional cybersecurity protection costs, increased insurance premiums and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. we could also be adversely affected if we lose access to information or services from a third-party service provider as a result of a cybersecurity or similar incident or system, network or operational failure or disruption affecting the third-party service provider. for a more detailed discussion of these risks and specific occurrences, see the "information security risk" section of item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of this annual report on form 10-k.
we are subject to complex and evolving laws, regulations, rules, standards and contractual obligations regarding privacy and cybersecurity, which could increase the cost of doing business, compliance risks and potential liability.
we are subject to complex and evolving laws, regulations, rules, standards and contractual obligations relating to the privacy and cybersecurity of the personal information of clients, employees or others, and any failure to comply with these laws, regulations, rules, standards and contractual obligations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage. as new privacy and cybersecurity-related laws, regulations, rules and standards are implemented, the time and resources needed for us table of contents to comply with such laws, regulations, rules and standards as well as our potential liability for non-compliance and reporting obligations in the case of cybersecurity or other similar incidents, may significantly increase. in addition, our businesses are increasingly subject to laws, regulations, rules and standards relating to privacy, cybersecurity, surveillance, encryption and data use in the jurisdictions in which we operate. compliance with these laws, regulations, rules and standards may require us to change our policies, procedures and technology for information security and segregation of data, which could, among other things, make us more vulnerable to operational failures and to monetary penalties for breach of such laws, regulations, rules and standards.
at the federal level, we are subject to the glba which requires financial institutions to, among other things, periodically disclose their privacy policies and practices relating to sharing personal information and, in some cases, enables retail customers to opt out of the sharing of certain non-public personal information with unaffiliated third parties. we are also subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the federal trade commission, which regulates unfair or deceptive acts or practices, including with respect to privacy and cybersecurity. moreover, the united states congress has considered, and is currently considering, various proposals for more comprehensive privacy and cybersecurity legislation, to which we may be subject if passed. additionally, the federal banking regulators, as well as the sec and related self-regulatory organizations, regularly issue guidance regarding cybersecurity that is intended to enhance cyber risk management among financial institutions.
privacy and cybersecurity are also areas of increasing state legislative focus and we are, or may in the future become, subject to various state laws and regulations regarding privacy and cybersecurity, such as the ccpa. other states where we do business, or may in the future do business, or from which we otherwise collect, or may in the future otherwise collect, personal information of residents have implemented, or are considering implementing, comprehensive privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations sharing similarities with the ccpa. similar laws already exist in a number of other states, and such legislation continues to expand across the country. in addition, laws in all 50 u.s. states generally require businesses to provide notice under certain circumstances to individuals whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. certain state laws and regulations may be more stringent, broader in scope or offer greater individual rights, with respect to personal information than federal or other state laws and regulations, and such laws and regulations may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts and increase compliance costs. aspects of the ccpa and other federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy and cybersecurity, as well as their enforcement, remain unclear, and we may be required to modify our practices in an effort to comply with them.
further, while we strive to publish and prominently display privacy policies that are accurate, comprehensive and compliant with applicable laws, regulations, rules and industry standards, we cannot ensure that our privacy policies and other statements regarding our practices will be sufficient to protect us from claims, proceedings, liability or adverse publicity relating to privacy or cybersecurity. although we endeavor to comply with our privacy policies, we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. the publication of our privacy policies and other documentation that provide promises and assurances about privacy and cybersecurity can subject us to potential federal or state action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresents our actual practices. additional risks could arise in connection with any failure or perceived failure by us, our service providers or other third parties with which we do business to provide adequate disclosure or transparency to our customers about the personal information collected from them and its use, to receive, document or honor the privacy preferences expressed by our customers, to protect personal information from unauthorized disclosure or to maintain proper training on privacy practices for all employees or third parties who have access to personal information in our possession or control.
any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, or applicable privacy and cybersecurity laws, regulations, rules, standards or contractual obligations, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or unauthorized loss, destruction, use, modification, acquisition, disclosure, release or transfer of personal information, may result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, the expenditure of substantial costs, time and other resources, proceedings or actions against us, legal liability, governmental investigations, enforcement actions, claims, fines, judgments, awards, penalties, sanctions and costly litigation (including class actions). any of the foregoing could harm our reputation, distract our management and technical personnel, increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the demand for our products and services and ultimately result in the imposition of liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. for further discussion of the privacy and cybersecurity laws, regulations, rules and standards we are, or may in the future become, subject to, see the "supervision and regulation-privacy and cybersecurity" section of item 1. "business" of this annual report on form 10-k.
we will continually encounter technological change and must effectively anticipate, develop and implement new technology.
the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. we have invested in technology to automate functions previously performed manually, to facilitate the ability of clients to engage in financial transactions and otherwise to enhance the client experience with respect to our products and services. we expect to make additional investments in innovation and technology to address technological table of contents disruption in the industry and improve client offerings and service. these changes allow us to better serve the our clients and to reduce costs.
our continued success depends, in part, upon our ability to address clients' needs by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy client demands, including demands for faster and more secure payment services, to create efficiencies in our operations and to integrate those offerings with legacy platforms or to update those legacy platforms. a failure to maintain or enhance our competitive position with respect to technology, whether because of a failure to anticipate client expectations, a failure in the performance of technological developments or an untimely roll out of developments, may cause us to lose market share or incur additional expense.
strategic risks industry competition may adversely affect our degree of success.
our profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully. we operate in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory, market and technological changes, as well as continued industry consolidation. this consolidation may produce larger, better-capitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices. for example, there have been a number of completed mergers of financial institutions within our market areas, and notwithstanding current regulatory approval delays there may in the future be additional consolidation. these and future mergers will, if completed, allow the merged financial institutions to benefit from cost savings and shared resources.
in our market areas, we face competition from other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, internet banks, fintechs, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms, mortgage companies and other financial intermediaries that offer similar services. many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and, therefore, may have greater flexibility in competing for business.
in addition, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services, such as loans and payment services, that traditionally were banking products, and made it possible for technology companies to compete with financial institutions in providing electronic, internet-based, and mobile phone-based financial solutions. competition with non-banks, including technology companies, to provide financial products and services is intensifying. in particular, the activity of fintechs has grown significantly over recent years and is expected to continue to grow. fintechs have and may continue to offer bank or bank-like products. for example, a number of fintechs have applied for, and in some cases been granted, bank or industrial loan charters. in addition, other fintechs have partnered with existing banks to allow them to offer deposit products to their customers. regulatory changes, such as the revisions to the fdic's rules on brokered deposits intended to reflect recent technological changes and innovations, may also make it easier for fintechs to partner with banks and offer deposit products. in addition to fintechs, traditional technology companies have begun to make efforts toward providing financial services directly to their customers and are expected to continue to explore new ways to do so. many of these companies, including our competitors, have fewer regulatory constraints, and some have lower cost structures, in part due to lack of physical locations. regions provides an array of digital products and services to our customers and we expect a bank's digital offerings to be a key competitive differentiator. the move toward digital banking and financial services, and customer expectations regarding digital offerings, will require us to invest greater resources in technological improvements and may put us at a disadvantage to banks and non-banks with greater resources to spend on technology.
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of additional factors, including customer convenience, quality of service, personal contacts, the quality of the technology that supports the customer experience and pricing and range of products. if we are unable to successfully compete for new customers and to retain our current customers, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected, perhaps materially. in particular, if we experience an outflow of deposits as a result of our customers seeking investments with higher yields or greater financial stability, we may be forced to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding to operate our business and meet withdrawal demands, thereby adversely affecting our net interest margin and financial performance. in addition, we may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. as a result, our ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business may be impaired, and our business, financial condition or results of operations, may be adversely affected.
our operations are concentrated primarily in the south, midwest and texas, and adverse changes in the economic conditions in this region can adversely affect our financial results and condition.
our operations are concentrated primarily in the south, midwest and texas. as a result, local economic conditions in these areas significantly affect the demand for the loans and other products we offer to our customers (including real estate, commercial and construction loans), the ability of borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. any declines in real estate values in these areas may adversely affect borrowers and the value of the collateral securing many of our loans, which could adversely affect our currently performing loans, leading to future delinquencies or defaults and increases in our provision for credit losses. adverse changes in the economic conditions in these regions could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
table of contents weakness in the residential real estate markets could adversely affect our performance.
as of december 31, 2023, consumer residential real estate loans represented approximately 26.3% of our total loan portfolio. a general decline in home values would adversely affect the value of collateral securing the residential real estate that we hold, as well as the volume of loan originations and the amount we realize on the sale of real estate loans. these factors could result in higher delinquencies and greater charge-offs in future periods, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
weakness in the commercial real estate markets could adversely affect our performance.
as of december 31, 2023, approximately 9.0% of our loan portfolio consisted of investor real estate loans. the properties securing income-producing investor real estate loans are typically not fully leased at the origination of the loan. the borrower's ability to repay the loan is instead dependent upon additional leasing through the life of the loan or the borrower's successful operation of a business. continued uncertainty in economic conditions may impair a borrower's business operations and slow the execution of new leases. such economic conditions may also lead to existing lease turnover. as a result of these factors, vacancy rates for retail, office and industrial space may increase, and hotel occupancy rates may decline. high vacancy and lower occupancy rates could also result in rents falling. the combination of these factors could result in deterioration in the fundamentals underlying the commercial real estate market and the deterioration in value of some of our loans. any such deterioration could adversely affect the ability of our borrowers to repay the amounts due under their loans. as a result, our business, results of operations or financial condition may also be adversely affected. specifically, the office property segment, which represents 1.5 percent of our total loan portfolio, is undergoing a structural shift given the rise of a remote work environment resulting in heightened vacancies and potentially reduced leasing needs. it is anticipated that this heightened risk environment for the office segment may take several years to resolve.
risks associated with home equity products where we are in a second lien position could materially adversely affect our performance.
home equity products, particularly those in a second lien position, may carry a higher risk of non-collection than other loans. home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines of credit. at december 31, 2023, the company's home equity portfolio included approximately $3.2 billion of home equity lines of credit and $2.4 billion of closed-end home equity loans (primarily originated as amortizing loans). real estate market values at the time of origination directly affect the amount of credit extended, and, in addition, past and future changes in these values impact the depth of potential losses. second lien position lending carries higher credit risk because any decrease in real estate pricing may result in the value of the collateral being insufficient to cover the second lien after the first lien position has been satisfied. as of december 31, 2023, approximately $2.0 billion of our home equity lines and loans were in a second lien position.
weakness in commodity businesses could adversely affect our performance.
many of our borrowers operate in industries that are directly or indirectly impacted by changes in commodity prices. this includes agriculture, livestock, metals, timber, textiles and energy businesses (including oil, gas and petrochemical), as well as businesses indirectly impacted by commodities prices such as businesses that transport commodities or manufacture equipment used in production of commodities. changes in commodity prices depend on local, regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity. these industries have been, and may in the future be, subject to significant volatility. for example, oil prices have been volatile, both rising and falling, in recent years. such volatility is expected to continue in the foreseeable future due to an unpredictable geopolitical and economic environment. as a consequence of oil and gas price volatility, our energy-related portfolio may be subject to additional pressure on credit quality metrics including past due, criticized, and non-performing loans, as well as net charge-offs. in addition, legislative changes such as the elimination of certain tax incentives and the transition to a less carbon dependent economy in response to climate change and other factors could have significant impacts on this portfolio.
an outbreak or escalation of hostilities between countries or within a country or region could have a material adverse effect on the u.s. economy and on our businesses.
aggressive actions by hostile governments or groups, including armed conflict or intensified cyber-attacks, could expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in other countries or escalating into full-scale war with potentially catastrophic consequences, particularly if one or more of the combatants possess nuclear weapons. depending on the scope of the conflict, the hostilities could result in worldwide economic disruption, heightened volatility in financial markets, severe declines in asset values, disruption of global trade and supply chains and diminished consumer, business and investor confidence.
instability in geopolitical matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. the macroeconomic environment in the united states is susceptible to global events and volatility in financial markets. for example, trade negotiations between the united states and other nations remain uncertain and could adversely impact economic and market conditions for our and our clients and counterparties. the wars in the ukraine, israel and the gaza strip presents destabilizing forces, including higher and more volatile commodity and food prices, which may cause international and domestic economic deterioration. financial markets may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including the wars in the ukraine, israel and the gaza strip, terrorism or other geopolitical events. this could magnify table of contents inflationary pressure resulting from the pandemic and other sources and extend any prolonged period of higher inflation. any of the above consequences could have significant negative effects on the u.s. economy, and, as a result, our operations and earnings. we could also experience more numerous and aggressive cyber-attacks launched by or under the sponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such a conflict.
operational risks we are subject to a variety of operational risks, including the risk of fraud or theft by internal or external parties, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.
we are exposed to many types of operational risks, including business resilience, process, third party, information technology, human resource, model and fraud risks, each of which may be amplified by continued remote work. our fraud risks include fraud committed by external parties against the company or its customers and fraud committed internally by our associates. certain fraud risks, including identity theft and account takeover, may increase as a result of customers' account or personally identifiable information being obtained through breaches of retailers' or other third parties' networks. examples of external fraud we face include fraudulent checks, stolen checks and other check-related fraud. we have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, mitigate, report and analyze these risks; however, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated, monitored or identified. if our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses, we may have to expend resources detecting and correcting the failure in our systems and we may be subject to potential claims from third parties and government agencies. we may also suffer severe reputational damage. any of these consequences could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. in particular, the unauthorized disclosure, misappropriation, mishandling or misuse of personal, non-public, confidential or proprietary information of customers could result in significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss.
we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.
third parties provide key components of our business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, internet connections and network access. while we have selected these third-party vendors carefully, performing upfront due diligence and ongoing monitoring activities, we do not control their actions. any issues that arise with respect to these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in services provided by a vendor (including as a result of a cyber-attack, other information security event or a natural disaster), financial or operational difficulties for the vendor, issues at third-party vendors to the vendors, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason, poor performance of services, failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or fraud or misconduct on the part of employees of any of our vendors, could trigger regulatory notification obligations on us, adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers, our reputation and our ability to conduct our business. in certain situations, replacing these third-party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable, inherent risk to our business operations. many of our vendors have also been impacted by remote work, market volatility and other factors that increase their risks of business disruption or that may otherwise affect their ability to perform under the terms of any agreements with us or provide essential services.
we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties.
in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. we also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors if made available. if this information is inaccurate, we may be subject to regulatory action, reputational harm or other adverse effects with respect to the operation of our business, our financial condition and our results of operations.
we are exposed to risk of environmental liability when we take title to property.
in the course of our business, we may foreclose on and take title to real estate. as a result, we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. the costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. in addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. if we become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.
table of contents we can be negatively affected if we fail to identify and address operational risks associated with the introduction of or changes to products, services and delivery platforms.
when we launch a new product or service, introduce a new platform for the delivery or distribution of products or services (including mobile connectivity, electronic trading and cloud computing), acquire or invest in a business or make changes to an existing product, service or delivery platform, we may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from those changes, or may fail to implement adequate controls to mitigate the risks associated with those changes. any significant failure in this regard could diminish our ability to operate one or more of our business or result in potential liability to clients, counterparties and customers, and result in increased operating expenses. we could also experience higher litigation costs, including regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions, reputational damage, impairment of our liquidity, regulatory intervention or weaker competitive standing. any of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.
enhanced regulatory and other standards for the oversight of vendors and other service providers can result in higher costs and other potential exposures.
we must comply with enhanced regulatory and other standards associated with doing business with vendors and other service providers, including standards relating to the outsourcing of functions as well as the performance of significant banking and other functions by subsidiaries. we incur significant costs and expenses in connection with our initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of our external service providers. our failure to appropriately assess and manage these relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities, could materially adversely affect us. specifically, any such failure could result in: potential harm to clients and customers, and any liability associated with that harm; regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions; lower revenues, and the opportunity cost from lost revenues; increased operational costs, or harm to our reputation.
reputational risks we are subject to environmental, social and governance risks that could adversely affect our business, reputation and the trading price of our common stock.
we are subject to a variety of risks, including reputational risk, associated with environmental, social and governance, or esg, issues. as a large financial institution with a diverse base of customers, vendors and suppliers, we may face negative publicity based on the identity, practices and perceptions of certain entities with whom we choose to do business. the public holds diverse and potentially conflicting views of those entities, and their activities, including the perceived environmental, social or economic impacts of those entities or of financial institutions' relationships with those entities. because we have multiple stakeholders, among them shareholders, customers, employees, federal and state regulatory authorities and political entities, often those stakeholders have differing, and sometimes conflicting, priorities and expectations regarding esg issues. for example, certain federal and state laws and regulations related to esg issues may include provisions that conflict with other laws and regulations, which may increase our costs or limit our ability to conduct business in certain jurisdictions.
simultaneous, disparate and divergent sentiments on esg-related matters from multiple stakeholder groups must be considered. for example, there is an increasing number of state-level anti-esg initiatives in the u.s. that may conflict with other regulatory requirements or our various stakeholders' expectations. such divergent, sometimes conflicting views on esg-related matters increase the risk that any action or lack thereof by us on such matters will be perceived negatively by some stakeholders. failing to comply with expectations and standards from investors, customers, regulators, policymakers and other stakeholders regarding esg-related issues, or taking action in conflict with one or another of those stakeholders' expectations, could also lead to loss of business, adverse publicity, an adverse impact on our reputation, customer complaints or public protests. negative publicity may be driven by adverse news coverage in traditional media and may also be spread more broadly through the use of social media platforms. if our relationships with our customers, vendors and suppliers were to become the subject of such negative publicity, our ability to attract and retain customers and employees, compete effectively and grow our business may be negatively impacted. additionally, a growing number of investors (in particular institutional investors who hold and manage substantial equity positions, in some cases in nearly all major u.s. listed companies) are integrating esg factors into their analysis of the expected risk and return of potential investments. the specific esg factors considered, as well as the approach to incorporating the factors into a broader investment process, vary by investor and can shift over time. our failure to align with, or remain aligned with, investors' esg-related priorities may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.
damage to our reputation could significantly harm our businesses.
our ability to attract and retain customers and highly-skilled management and employees is impacted by our reputation. a negative public opinion of us and our business can result from any number of activities, including our lending practices, corporate governance and regulatory compliance, acquisitions and actions taken by community organizations in response to these activities. furthermore, negative publicity regarding us as an employer could have an adverse impact on our reputation, especially with respect to matters of diversity, pay equity and workplace harassment.
table of contents significant harm to our reputation, or the reputation of any company, could also arise as a result of regulatory or governmental actions, litigation and the activities of our customers, other participants in the financial services industry or our contractual counterparties, such as our service providers and vendors.
in addition, a cybersecurity event affecting us or our customers' data could have a negative impact on our reputation and customer confidence in us and our cybersecurity practices. damage to our reputation could also adversely affect our credit ratings and access to the capital markets.
additionally, the widespread use of social media platforms by virtually every segment of society facilitates the rapid dissemination of information or misinformation, which magnifies the potential harm to our reputation.
legal, regulatory and compliance risks we are, and may in the future be, subject to litigation, investigations and governmental proceedings that may result in liabilities adversely affecting our financial condition, business or results of operations or in reputational harm.
we and our subsidiaries are, and may in the future be, named as defendants in various class actions and other litigation, and may be the subject of subpoenas, reviews, requests for information, investigations, and formal and informal proceedings by government and self-regulatory agencies regarding our and their businesses and activities (including subpoenas, requests for information and investigations related to the activities of our customers). any such matters may result in material adverse consequences to our results of operations, financial condition or ability to conduct our business, including adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties (including civil money penalties under applicable banking laws), injunctions, restitution, orders, restrictions on our business activities or other relief. our involvement in any such matters, even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor, could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management's attention from the operation of our business. further, any settlement, consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by government or self-regulatory agencies may result in additional litigation, investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government or self-regulatory agencies (including the inquiries mentioned above) begin independent reviews of the same businesses or activities. in general, the amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or investigations, including those relating to anti-money laundering matters or sales practices, have increased substantially and are likely to remain elevated. regulators and other governmental authorities may also be more likely to pursue enforcement actions, or seek admissions of wrongdoing, in connection with the resolution of an inquiry or investigation to the extent a firm has previously been subject to other governmental investigations or enforcement actions. in some cases, governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms as part of such settlements, which could have significant collateral consequences for a financial institution, including loss of customers, restrictions on the ability to access the capital markets and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products for a period of time. in addition, enforcement matters could impact our supervisory and cra ratings, which may in turn restrict or limit our activities.
additional information relating to our litigation, investigations and other proceedings is discussed in note 23 "commitments, contingencies and guarantees" to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form 10-k.
we are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which could have an adverse impact on our operations.
we are subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and examination governing almost all aspects of our operations, which limits the businesses in which we may permissibly engage. the laws and regulations governing our business are intended primarily for the protection of our depositors, our customers, the financial system and the fdic insurance fund, not our shareholders or other creditors. these laws and regulations govern a variety of matters, including certain debt obligations, changes in control, maintenance of adequate capital, consumer protection and general business operations and financial condition (including permissible types, amounts and terms of loans and investments, the amount of reserves against deposits, restrictions on dividends and repurchases of our capital securities, establishment of branch offices and the maximum interest rate that may be charged by law). further, we must obtain approval from our regulators before engaging in many activities, and our regulators have the ability to compel us to, or restrict us from, taking certain actions entirely. there can be no assurance that any regulatory approvals we may require or otherwise seek will be obtained in a timely manner or at all.
regulations affecting banks and other financial institutions are undergoing continuous review and frequently change, and the ultimate effect of such changes cannot be predicted. regulations and laws may be modified or repealed at any time, and new legislation may be enacted that will affect us, including those resulting from any changes to control of branches of the u.s government or leadership of administrative agencies resulting from upcoming elections.
any changes in any federal and state law, as well as regulations and governmental policies, income tax laws and accounting principles, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including ways that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. failure to appropriately comply with any such laws, regulations or principles could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties or damage to our reputation, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. our regulatory capital position is discussed in greater detail in note 12 "regulatory capital requirements and restrictions" to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form 10-k.
table of contents we are subject to a variety of risks in connection with any sale of loans we may conduct.
in connection with our sale of one or more loan portfolios, we may make certain representations and warranties to the purchaser concerning the loans sold and the procedures under which those loans have been originated and serviced. if any of these representations and warranties are incorrect, we may be required to indemnify the purchaser for any related losses, or we may be required to repurchase part or all of the affected loans. we may also be required to repurchase loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of early payment default by the borrower on a loan we have sold. if we are required to make any indemnity payments or repurchases and do not have a remedy available to us against a solvent counterparty, we may not be able to recover our losses resulting from these indemnity payments and repurchases. consequently, our results of operations may be adversely affected.
in addition, we must report as held for sale any loans that we have undertaken to sell, whether or not a purchase agreement for the loans has been executed. we may, therefore, be unable to ultimately complete a sale for part or all of the loans we classify as held for sale. management must exercise its judgment in determining when loans must be reclassified from held for investment status to held for sale status under applicable accounting guidelines. any failure to accurately report loans as held for sale could result in regulatory investigations and monetary penalties. any of these actions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. reclassifying loans from held for investment to held for sale also requires that the affected loans be marked to the lower of cost or fair value. as a result, any loans classified as held for sale may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates and by changes in the borrower's creditworthiness. we may be required to reduce the value of any loans we mark held for sale, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
we may be subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements.
regions and regions bank are each subject to capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital that must be maintained. from time to time, the regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines. if we fail to meet these minimum capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and other regulatory requirements, we or our subsidiaries may be restricted in the types of activities we may conduct and may be prohibited from taking certain capital actions, such as paying dividends and repurchasing or redeeming capital securities.
regions and regions bank are each required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the federal reserve, which are based on the basel iii framework. proposed changes to applicable capital and liquidity requirements, such as the basel iii proposal and the long-term debt proposal, could result in increased expenses or cost of funding, which could negatively affect our financial results or our ability to pay dividends and engage in share repurchases.
for more information concerning our legal and regulatory obligations with respect to basel iii and long-term debt requirements, please see the "supervision and regulation-regulatory capital requirements" discussion within item 1. "business," and for more information concerning our compliance with capital and liquidity requirements, see note 12 "regulatory capital requirements and restrictions" to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form 10-k.
rulemaking changes and regulatory initiatives implemented by the cfpb may result in higher regulatory and compliance costs that may adversely affect our results of operations.
since its formation, the cfpb has finalized a number of significant rules and introduced new regulatory initiatives, including, without limitation, by way of its enforcement authority and through public statements, that could have a significant impact on our business and the financial services industry more generally. we may also be required to add additional compliance personnel or incur other significant compliance-related expenses. our business, results of operations or competitive position may be adversely affected as a result.
in addition, the current u.s. presidential administration has called on all regulatory agencies to reduce or eliminate certain fees relating to a number of services, including banking services. at the same time, the cfpb launched an initiative to reduce the amounts and types of fees financial institutions may charge, including the issuance of a proposed rule that would significantly reduce the permissible amount of credit card late fees. such changes could affect the company's ability or willingness to provide certain products or services, necessitate changes to the company's business practices or have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
we may not be able to complete future acquisitions, may not be successful in realizing the benefits of any future acquisitions that are completed or may choose not to pursue acquisition opportunities we might find beneficial.
we may, from time to time, evaluate and engage in the acquisition or divestiture of businesses (including their assets or liabilities, such as loans or deposits). we must generally satisfy a number of meaningful conditions prior to completing any such transaction, including in certain cases, federal and state bank regulatory approvals.
the process for obtaining required regulatory approvals, particularly for large financial institutions, like regions, can be difficult, time-consuming and unpredictable. we may fail to pursue, evaluate or complete strategic and competitively table of contents significant business opportunities as a result of our inability, or our perceived inability, to obtain required regulatory approvals in a timely manner or at all.
assuming we are able to successfully complete one or more transactions, we may not be able to successfully integrate and realize the expected synergies from any completed transaction in a timely manner or at all. in particular, we may be held responsible by federal and state regulators for regulatory and compliance failures at an acquired business prior to the date of the acquisition, and these failures by the acquired company may have negative consequences for us, including the imposition of formal or informal enforcement actions. completion and integration of any transaction may also divert management attention from other matters, result in additional costs and expenses or adversely affect our relationships with our customers and employees, any of which may adversely affect our business or results of operations. future acquisitions may also result in dilution of our current shareholders' ownership interests or may require we incur additional indebtedness or use a substantial amount of our available cash and other liquid assets. as a result, our financial condition may be affected, and we may become more susceptible to economic conditions and competitive pressures.
increases in fdic insurance assessments may adversely affect our earnings.
our deposits are insured by the fdic up to legal limits and, accordingly, we are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments. we generally cannot control the amount of assessments we will be required to pay for fdic insurance. in 2022, the fdic adopted a final rule to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules by 2 basis points, which began with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. the final rule requires the revised rates to remain in effect until the dif reserve ratio meets or exceeds 1.35 percent.
to recoup losses to the dif resulting from the bank failures of 2023, the fdic also adopted a special assessment that will become effective in 2024 and will be collected over eight quarterly assessment periods. the fdic may require us to pay higher fdic assessments than we currently do or may charge additional special assessments or future prepayments if, for example, there are financial institution failures in the future. any increase in deposit assessments or special assessments may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. see the "supervision and regulation-deposit insurance" discussion within item 1. "business" and the "non-interest expense" discussion within item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information related to the fdic's deposit insurance assessments applicable to regions bank.
unfavorable results from ongoing stress analyses may adversely affect our ability to retain customers or compete for new business opportunities.
the federal reserve conducts supervisory stress testing of us to evaluate our ability to absorb losses in baseline and severely adverse economic and stressed financial scenarios generated by the federal reserve. the federal reserve also has implemented the scb framework which created a firm specific risk sensitive buffer that is informed by the results of supervisory stress testing, and is applied to regulatory minimum capital levels to help determine effective minimum ratio requirements. firm specific scb requirements, as well as a summary of the results of certain aspects of the federal reserve's supervisory stress testing and firm specific results are released publicly.
although the theoretical stress tests are not meant to assess our current condition or outlook, our customers may misinterpret and negatively react to the results of these stress tests despite the strength of our financial condition. any potential misinterpretations and adverse reactions could limit our ability to attract and retain customers or to effectively compete for new business opportunities. the inability to attract and retain customers or effectively compete for new business may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
our regulators may also require us to raise additional capital or take other actions, or may impose restrictions on capital distributions, based on the results of the supervisory stress tests, such as requiring revisions or resubmission of our annual capital plan, which could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital securities. in addition, we may not be able to raise additional capital if required to do so, or may not be able to do so on terms that we believe are advantageous to regions or its current shareholders. any such capital raises, if required, may also be dilutive to our existing shareholders. as discussed in the "supervision and regulation" section of item 1. of this annual report on form 10-k, the company was not required to participate in the 2023 ccar process. however, the company did receive its scb reflecting planned capital changes including plans to increase its common stock dividend. the federal reserve communicated that the company exceeded all minimum capital levels under the supervisory stress test and the company's scb for the fourth quarter of 2023 through the third quarter of 2024 continues to be floored at 2.5 percent. despite exceeding these minimum capital levels, we may experience unfavorable results from stress test analyses in the future.
we are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends, distributions and other payments.
we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our banking and other subsidiaries. our principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest on our outstanding debt, is dividends from regions bank. there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by regions bank to us, as well as by us to our shareholders. regulations of both the federal reserve and the state of alabama affect the ability of regions bank to pay dividends and other distributions to us and to make loans to the holding company. if regions bank is unable to make table of contents dividend payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available, we may not be able to make dividend payments to our common and preferred shareholders or principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt. see the "shareholders' equity" section of item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of this annual report on form 10-k. in addition, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary, except to the extent that any of our claims as a creditor of such subsidiary may be recognized. as a result, shares of our capital stock are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of our subsidiaries. at december 31, 2023, our subsidiaries' total deposits and borrowings were approximately $128.3 billion.
we may not pay dividends on shares of our capital stock.
holders of shares of our capital stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. furthermore, the terms of our outstanding preferred stock prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends on any junior series of our capital stock, including our common stock, or from repurchasing, redeeming or acquiring such junior stock, unless we have declared and paid full dividends on our outstanding preferred stock for the most recently completed dividend period.
we are also subject to statutory and regulatory limitations on our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock. for example, it is the policy of the federal reserve that bhcs should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of earnings, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization's expected future needs, asset quality and financial condition. additionally, we are subject to the federal reserve's scb requirement whereby supervisory stress testing informs a buffer above regulatory minimum capital levels that must be maintained to avoid restrictions on capital distributions. lastly, if we are unable to satisfy the capital requirements applicable to us for any reason, we may be limited in our ability to declare and pay dividends on our capital stock.
anti-takeover and banking laws and certain agreements and charter provisions may adversely affect share value.
certain provisions of state and federal law and our certificate of incorporation may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us without our board's approval. under federal law, subject to certain exemptions, a person, entity or group must notify the federal banking agencies before acquiring control of a bhc. acquisition of 10% or more of any class of voting stock of a bhc or state member bank, including shares of our common stock, creates a rebuttable presumption that the acquirer "controls" the bhc or state member bank. also, as noted under the "supervision and regulation" section of item 1. of this annual report on form 10-k, a bhc must obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve before, among other things, acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5 percent of the voting shares of any bank, including regions bank. one factor the federal banking agencies must consider in certain acquisitions is the systemic impact of the transaction. this may make it more difficult for large institutions to acquire other large institutions and may otherwise delay the regulatory approval process, possibly by requiring public hearings. similarly, under alabama state law, a person or group of persons must receive approval from the superintendent of banks before acquiring "control" of an alabama bank or any entity having control of an alabama bank. for the purposes of determining whether approval is required, "control" is defined as the power, directly or indirectly, to vote the lesser of (i) 25% or more of any class of voting securities of an alabama bank (or any entity having control of an alabama bank) or (ii) 10% or more of any class of voting securities of an alabama bank (or any entity having control of an alabama bank) if no other person will own, control or hold the power to vote a majority of that class of voting securities following the acquisition of such voting securities. furthermore, there also are provisions in our certificate of incorporation that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt. for example, holders of our preferred stock have certain voting rights that could adversely affect share value. if and when dividends on the preferred stock have not been declared and paid for at least six quarterly dividend periods or their equivalent (whether or not consecutive), the authorized number of directors then constituting our board will automatically be increased by two, and the preferred shareholders will be entitled to elect the two additional directors. also, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of all of the then-outstanding shares of the preferred stock is required to consummate a binding share-exchange or reclassification involving the preferred stock, or a merger or consolidation of regions with or into another entity, unless certain requirements are met. these statutory provisions and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, including the rights of the holders of our preferred stock, could result in regions being less attractive to a potential acquirer and thus adversely affect our share value.
table of contents our amended and restated bylaws designate (i) the court of chancery of the state of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders and (ii) the federal district courts of the united states as the sole and exclusive forum for any action asserting a cause of action arising under the securities act, which could limit our shareholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with our company or our company's directors, officers or other employees.
our amended and restated bylaws (our "bylaws") contain two forum selection provisions. first, our bylaws provide that, except for claims made under the securities act of 1933 (which are the subject of the forum selection provision described in the following sentence), unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) derivative actions brought on behalf of the company, (ii) certain actions asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty, (iii) actions asserting a claim against the company or a director, officer or other employee of the company arising pursuant to any provision of delaware law, our certificate of incorporation, or our bylaws or (iv) any actions asserting a claim against the company or any director, officer or other employee of the company governed by the internal affairs doctrine, shall be the court of chancery of the state of delaware or the federal district court for the district of delaware if the court of chancery of the state of delaware has no jurisdiction. in addition, our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for any action asserting a cause of action arising under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"), or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder, shall be the federal district courts of the united states. our bylaws further provide that our shareholders are deemed to have received notice of and consented to both of these forum selection provisions.
the forum selection provisions of our bylaws may discourage claims or limit shareholders' ability to submit claims in a judicial forum that they find favorable, and may result in additional costs for a stockholder seeking to bring a claim. additionally, with respect to our forum selection provision relating to claims made under the securities act, we note that, while section 27 of the exchange act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over claims brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the exchange act, section 22 of the securities act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the securities act. as noted above, our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, u.s. federal district courts will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the securities act. while we believe the risk of a court declining to enforce our forum selection provisions is low, if a court were to determine either forum selection provision to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable in a particular action, we may incur additional costs in conjunction with our efforts to resolve the dispute in an alternative jurisdiction or multiple jurisdictions, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors.
we face substantial legal and operational risks in safeguarding personal information.
our businesses are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals. individuals whose personal information may be protected by law can include our customers (and in some cases our customers' customers), prospective customers, job applicants, employees, and the employees of our vendors and third parties. complying with the laws, rules and regulations applicable to our disclosure, collection, use, sharing and storage of personal information can increase operating costs, impact the development of new products or services, and reduce operational efficiency. any mishandling or misuse or personal information by us or third party affiliated with us could expose us to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions.
additional risks could arise from our or third parties' failure to provide adequate disclosure or transparency to our customers about the personal information collected from them and the use of such information; to receive, document and honor the privacy preferences expressed by our customers; to protect personal information from unauthorized disclosure; or to maintain proper training on privacy practices for all employees or third parties who have access to personal information. concerns regarding the effectiveness of our measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that those measures are inadequate, could cause us to lose existing or potential clients and customers, and thereby reduce our revenues. furthermore, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, rules and regulations may subject it to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, significant liabilities or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. any of these could damage our reputation and otherwise adversely affect our businesses.
in recent years, well-publicized incidents involving the inappropriate collection, use, sharing or storage of personal information have led to expanded governmental scrutiny of practices relating to the safeguarding of personal information by companies. that scrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and could in the future lead to, the adoption of stricter laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection, use, sharing and storage of personal information. we will likely be subject to new and evolving data privacy laws in the u.s. and abroad, which could result in additional costs of compliance, litigation, regulatory fines and enforcement actions. these types of laws, rules and regulations could prohibit or significantly restrict financial services firms such as us from sharing information among affiliates or with third parties such as vendors, and thereby increase compliance costs, or could restrict our use of personal data when developing or offering products or services to customers.
table of contents these restrictions could also inhibit our development or marketing of certain products or services, or increase the costs of offering them to customers.
differences in regulation can affect our ability to compete effectively.
the content and application of laws and regulations affecting financial services firms sometimes vary according to factors such as the size of the firm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates and other criteria. financial technology companies and other non-traditional competitors may not be subject to banking regulation, or may be supervised by a national or state regulatory agency that does not have the same regulatory priorities or supervisory requirements as our regulators. these differences in regulation can impair our ability to compete effectively with competitors that are less regulated that do not have similar compliance costs.
talent management risks our businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees.
our success depends, in part, on our executive officers and other key personnel. the market for qualified individuals is highly competitive, and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel. as a large financial and banking institution, we may be subject to limitations on compensation practices, which may or may not affect our competitors, by the federal reserve, the fdic or other regulators. these limitations could further affect our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key personnel, in particular as we are more often competing for personnel with fintechs, technology companies and other less regulated entities who may not have the same limitations on compensation as we do. the increase in remote work arrangements and opportunities in regional, national and global labor markets has also increased competition to attract and retain skilled personnel. our current or future approach to in-office and remote-work arrangements may not meet the needs or expectations of our current or prospective employees or may not be perceived as favorable as the arrangements offered by other employers, which could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees.
our operations rely on its ability, and the ability of key external parties, to maintain appropriately staffed workforces, and on the competence, trustworthiness, health and safety of employees.
our ability to operate our businesses efficiently and profitably, to offer products and services that meet the expectations of our clients and customers, and to maintain an effective risk management framework is highly dependent on our ability to staff its operations appropriately and on the competence, integrity, health and safety of our employees. we are similarly dependent on the workforces of other parties on which our operations rely, including vendors and other service providers. our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by the ineffective implementation of business decisions; any failure to institute controls that appropriately address risks associated with business activities; or appropriately train employees with respect to those risks and controls; staffing shortages, particularly in tight labor markets. in addition, our business could be adversely impacted by a significant operational breakdown or failure, theft, fraud or other unlawful conduct or other negative outcomes caused by human error or misconduct by an employee of us or of another party on which our operations depend. our operations could also be impaired if the measures taken by us or by governmental authorities to help ensure the health and safety of our employees are ineffective, or if any external party on which we rely fails to take appropriate and effective actions to protect the health and safety of its employees.
estimates and assumptions risks our reported financial results depend on management's selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates.
our accounting policies and assumptions are fundamental to our reported financial condition and results of operations. our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with gaap and reflect management's judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results. in some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet may result in us reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.
certain accounting policies are critical to presenting our reported financial condition and results of operations. they require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. the company's critical accounting estimates include: the allowance for credit losses; fair value measurements; intangible assets; residential msrs; and income taxes. because of the uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters, we may be required to do one or more of the following: significantly increase the allowance for credit losses and/or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the allowance provided; recognize significant losses on assets carried at fair value; recognize significant impairment on our goodwill, other intangible assets or deferred tax asset balances; significantly increase our accrued income taxes; or significantly decrease the value of our residential msrs. any of these actions could adversely affect our reported financial condition and results of operations.
table of contents if the models that we use in our business perform poorly or provide inadequate information, our business or results of operations may be adversely affected.
we utilize quantitative models, machine learning models and artificial intelligence models to assist in measuring risks and estimating or predicting certain financial values. models may be used in processes such as determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, forecasting financial performance, predicting losses, improving customer services, maintaining adherence to laws and regulations, assessing capital adequacy, calculating regulatory capital levels, preventing fraud, strengthening customer authentication processes, generating marketing analytics, prospecting leads and estimating the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. poorly designed, implemented or managed models present the risk that our business decisions that consider information based on such models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy or inaccuracy of that information, which may lead to losses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our reported financial condition and results of operations. also, information we provide to the public or to our regulators based on poorly designed, implemented or managed models could be inaccurate or misleading. some of the decisions that our regulators make, including those related to capital distributions to our shareholders, could be affected adversely due to the perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.
changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition.
from time to time, the fasb and sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.
the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future.
as of december 31, 2023, we had $5.7 billion of goodwill and $205 million of other intangible assets. a significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower economic growth or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common stock, any or all of which could be materially impacted by many of the risk factors discussed herein, may necessitate our taking charges in the future related to the impairment of our goodwill. future regulatory actions and increases in income tax rates could also have a material impact on assessments of goodwill for impairment. if we were to conclude that a future write-down of our goodwill is necessary, we would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill consist primarily of relationship assets. adverse events or circumstances could impact the recoverability of intangible assets, and, to the extent these intangible assets are deemed unrecoverable, a non-cash impairment charge would be recorded, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
other external risks our business and financial performance could be adversely affected by a u.s. government debt default or the threat of such a default.
a u.s. government debt default would have material adverse impact on our business and financial performance, including a decrease in the value of treasury bonds and other government securities held by us, which could negatively impact our capital position and our ability to meet regulatory requirements. other negative impacts could be volatile capital markets, an adverse impact on the u.s. economy and the u.s. dollar, as well as increased default rates among borrowers in light of increased economic uncertainty. some of these impacts might occur even in the absence of an actual default but as a consequence of extended political negotiations around the threat of such a default and a government shutdown.
weather-related events, pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters could cause a disruption in our operations or lead to other consequences that could adversely impact our financial results and condition. these impacts could be intensified by climate change. heightening focus on climate change may also carry transition risks that could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
weather-related events, health crises, the occurrence or worsening of disease outbreaks or pandemics such as covid-19, or other catastrophic events, other natural or man-made disasters, climate change and the transition to a lower-carbon economy, as well as government actions or other restrictions in connection with such events, pose shorter- and longer-term risks to our business and/or that of our customers, vendors and suppliers and are expected to increase over time.
a significant portion of our operations is located in the areas bordering the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean, regions that are susceptible to hurricanes, or in areas of the southeastern u.s. that are susceptible to tornadoes and other severe weather events. in particular, in recent years, a number of severe hurricanes impacted areas in our footprint. many areas in the southeastern u.s. have also experienced severe droughts and floods in recent years. any of these, or any other severe weather event, could cause disruption to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our overall business, results of operations or financial condition. in some cases, we have taken preemptive measures in an effort to mitigate certain of these adverse effects, such as maintaining insurance that includes coverage for resultant losses and expenses where possible, though these measures cannot fully mitigate all future risks. we cannot be sure that such insurance will continue to be available to us table of contents on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. in addition, such measures cannot predict the nature, timing or level of severe weather events or prevent the disruption that a catastrophic earthquake, fire, hurricane, tornado or other severe weather event could cause to the markets that we serve and any resulting adverse impact on our customers, such as hindering our borrowers' ability to timely repay their loans and diminishing the value of any collateral held by us. man-made disasters and other events connected with the gulf of mexico or atlantic ocean, such as oil spills, could have similar effects.
climate change could intensify the severity of and increase the frequency of adverse effects of weather-related events impacting us and our customers. namely, climate change may intensify the severity of and increase the frequency of earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, floods and other weather-related events, which could cause even greater disruption to our business and operations. longer-term changes, such as increasing average temperatures and rising sea levels, may damage, destroy or otherwise impact the value or productivity of our properties and other assets, reduce the availability of or increase the cost of insurance, and/or lead to prolonged disruptions in our operations.
responding to concerns around climate change provides us with potential new avenues through which we can support our stakeholders but also exposes us to risks associated with the transition to a lower-carbon economy. such risks may result from changes in policies, laws and regulations, technologies, or market preferences relating to climate change. these changes could materially and negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and our reputation, in addition to having a similar impact on our customers, vendors and suppliers. federal and state regulatory authorities, investors and other third parties have increasingly scrutinized the business activities of financial institutions and the relationship of those activities to climate change (including such institutions' involvement or their customers' involvement in certain industries or projects associated with climate change, as well as any decisions to conduct or change activities in response to considerations relating to climate change), which may result in financial institutions facing increased pressure regarding the disclosure and management of climate risks and related lending and investment activities. as a result, we may face increased scrutiny related to our ability to demonstrate resilience to potential climate-related risks, including systemic risks posed by operational disruptions and external demands. ongoing legislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding climate risk management and practices, including inconsistent (and sometimes conflicting) perspectives or requirements, may result in higher regulatory, compliance, credit and reputational risks and costs. in addition, the transition to a lower-carbon economy could indirectly subject us to specific risks through our borrowers' exposure to changes in commodity prices. for more information see the "we are subject to environmental, social and governance risks that could adversely affect our business, reputation and the trading price of our common stock" and "weakness in commodity businesses could adversely affect our performance" risk factors above.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview management believes the following sections provide an overview of several of the most relevant matters necessary for an understanding of the financial aspects of regions's business, particularly regarding its 2023 results. cross references to more detailed information regarding each topic within md&a and the consolidated financial statements are included. this summary is intended to assist in understanding the information provided, but should be read in conjunction with the entire md&a and consolidated financial statements, as well as the other sections of this annual report on form 10-k.
economic environment in regions' banking markets after full-year 2023 growth of 2.5 percent, regions' baseline forecast anticipates real gdp growth of 2.6 percent in 2024. while the company did not have recession as its base forecast for 2023, the economy outperformed expectations, reflecting marked improvement on the supply side of the economy that allowed for faster growth and decelerating inflation. growth is expected to be somewhat restrained over the first half of 2024 before picking up over the second half of the year.
the labor market proved to be resilient in 2023. while the pace of job growth slowed over the course of the year, it was driven by a slower pace of hiring as opposed to a rising pace of layoffs. this pattern is expected to continue in 2024, with further slowing in the pace of job growth putting upward pressure on the unemployment rate, but the company does not anticipate a significant, broad-based, and sustained spike in layoffs.
a slowing pace of job growth will lead to further deceleration in growth of aggregate labor earnings, but growth in labor earnings is expected to continue to outpace inflation, thus providing support for consumer spending. household balance sheets remain notably healthy, and the preponderance of fixed-rate debt on household balance sheets has been a buffer against the effects of higher interest rates. full-year 2024 growth in real consumer spending is expected to be slightly faster than 2023 growth.
real business investment in equipment and machinery is expected to remain soft before picking up over the second half of 2024. at the same time, the wave of business spending on structures seen over much of 2023 is subsiding, to the point that real spending on structures is expected to offer little, if any, support for real gdp growth in 2024. after having been displaced by spending on structures in 2023, business investment in intellectual property products is expected to return to its usual role as the fastest growing segment of real business fixed investment.
higher mortgage interest rates weighed on single family construction and sales in 2023, but sales of new single family homes proved to be more resilient than anticipated driven by a combination of still-significant pent-up demand for home purchases and the lack of existing single family homes for sale. while mortgage rates have started to decline, helping to ease affordability constraints, it will likely not do much to unlock inventories of existing homes for sale. builders should fare better in 2024 and real residential fixed investment should be a modest support for top-line real gdp growth in 2024.
further deceleration in inflation in 2024, driven by a slower pace of economic growth, a modestly rising unemployment rate, and the avoidance of disruptions to the supply side of the economy would be consistent with the fomc beginning to cut the fed funds rate even with inflation above their 2.0 percent target rate. the real, or, inflation-adjusted, current funds rate is meaningfully restrictive, and further deceleration in inflation without cuts in the fed funds rate would effectively make policy more restrictive. as such, we expect four twenty-five basis point cuts in the fed funds rate by year-end 2024.
patterns of economic activity within the regions footprint are expected to be broadly similar to those seen for the u.s. as a whole. a number of in-footprint states have seen heightened flows of domestic in-migration since the onset of the pandemic, which has resulted in more rapid rates of job growth and more rapid growth in housing costs. if, as regions anticipates, the broader economy slows and labor market conditions loosen, it could be that migration patterns will shift over coming quarters. job growth for the company's footprint as a whole is expected to be faster than that for the u.s. as a whole. some of the metro areas which had, prior to the increase in mortgage interest rates, seen the largest increases in house prices could experience declining house prices, but continued robust population growth in these markets will help stem the extent of any such declines.
the continued economic uncertainty, as described above, impacted regions' forecast utilized in calculating the acl as of december 31, 2023. see the "allowance" section for further information.
2023 results regions reported net income available to common shareholders of $2.0 billion or $2.11 per diluted share in 2023 compared to net income available to common shareholders of $2.1 billion or $2.28 per diluted share in 2022.
net interest income (taxable-equivalent basis) totaled $5.4 billion in 2023 compared to $4.8 billion in 2022. the net interest margin (taxable-equivalent basis) was 3.90 percent in 2023, reflecting a 54 basis point increase from 2022. the increase in net interest income was primarily driven by a significant increase in market interest rates and average loan growth. deposit mix and pricing normalization combined with higher overall funding costs, which are expected in a rising rate environment, partially offset the increases in net interest income.
table of contents the provision for credit losses totaled $553 million in 2023 compared to $271 million in 2022. the provision for credit losses was higher than net charge-offs by $156 million in 2023. the increase in the provision for credit losses was driven primarily by adverse risk migration and continued credit normalization, as well as a build in qualitative adjustments for incremental risk in higher risk portfolios. refer to the "allowance for credit losses" section of management's discussion and analysis for further detail.
non-interest income was $2.3 billion in 2023 compared to $2.4 billion in 2022. the decrease was primarily driven by lower capital markets income, service charges on deposit accounts and mortgage income partially offset by an increase in market valuation adjustments on employee benefit assets. see table 4 "non-interest income" for further details.
non-interest expense was $4.4 billion in 2023 and $4.1 billion in 2022. the increase was driven by an increase in fdic insurance assessments primarily related to the special assessment, operational losses, and salaries and employee benefits. these increases were partially offset by a decline in professional, legal and regulatory expenses related to a settled matter with the cfpb in 2022. see table 5 "non-interest expense" for further details.
regions' effective tax rate was 20.5 percent in 2023 compared to 22.0 percent in 2022. see the "income taxes" section for further details.

on april 20, 2022, the board authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of the company's common stock, permitting purchases from the second quarter of 2022 through the fourth quarter of 2024. in the fourth quarter of 2023, regions repurchased approximately 16 million shares of common stock under these programs, which reduced shareholders' equity by $252 million.

•note 12 "regulatory capital requirements and restrictions" to the consolidated financial statements loan portfolio and credit during 2023, total loans increased by $1.4 billion or 1.4 percent compared to 2022. the increase was primarily driven by an increase in the consumer portfolio of $1.2 billion, with the combined balance of commercial and investor real estate loans also increasing by $198 million. the increase in consumer loans reflects growth in residential first mortgage and in other consumer loans, which was driven by consumer home improvement loans. refer to the "portfolio characteristics" section for further discussion.
table of contents net charge-offs totaled $397 million, or 0.40 percent of average loans, in 2023, compared to $263 million, or 0.29 percent in 2022, with both periods reflecting an increase in consumer charge-offs due to the sale of loan portfolios. in 2023 and 2022, adjusted net charge-offs (non-gaap) totaled $362 million, or 0.37 percent, and $200 million, or 0.22 percent, respectively. see table 1 "gaap to non-gaap reconciliations for additional information. commercial and industrial net charge-offs also increased from 2022 to 2023. the allowance was 1.73 percent of total loans, net of unearned income at december 31, 2023, an increase from 1.63 percent at december 31, 2022. the coverage ratio of allowance to non-performing loans excluding held for sale was 211 percent at december 31, 2023, compared to 317 percent at december 31, 2022.

at december 31, 2023, the company's borrowing capacity with the federal reserve was $21.3 billion based on available collateral. borrowing availability with the fhlb was $15.1 billion based on available collateral at the same date. regions also maintains a shelf registration statement with the u.s. securities and exchange commission that can be utilized by the company to issue various debt and/or equity securities. additionally, regions' board has authorized regions bank to issue up to $10 billion in aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one time.
regions is required to conduct liquidity stress testing and measure its available sources of liquidity against minimums as established by regions' internal liquidity policy. regions was fully compliant with those requirements as of year-end.

(1)expectation for cet1 is to continue to manage around 10 percent over the near term.
(2)expectation for net interest income assumes stable or lower short-term interest rates; flat long-term rate held at december 31, 2023 levels.
the reconciliation with respect to these forward-looking non-gaap measures is expected to be consistent with the actual non-gaap reconciliations within management's discussion and analysis of this form 10-k. for more information related to the company's 2024 expectations, refer to the related sub-sections discussed in more detail within management's discussion and analysis of this form 10-k.
table of contents general the following discussion and financial information is presented to aid in understanding regions' financial position and results of operations. the emphasis of this discussion will be on operations for the years 2023 and 2022; in addition, financial information for prior years will also be presented when appropriate.
regions' profitability, like that of many other financial institutions, is dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income as well as non-interest income sources. net interest income is primarily the difference between the interest income regions receives on interest-earning assets, such as loans, leases, investment securities and cash balances held at the federal reserve bank, and the interest expense regions pays on interest-bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. regions' net interest income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its assets and interest paid on its liabilities. non-interest income includes fees from service charges on deposit accounts, card and atm fees, mortgage servicing and secondary marketing, investment management and trust activities, capital markets and other customer services which regions provides. results of operations are also affected by the provision for credit losses and non-interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, equipment and software expenses, occupancy, professional, legal and regulatory expenses, fdic insurance assessments, and other operating expenses, as well as income taxes.
economic conditions, competition, new legislation and related rules impacting regulation of the financial services industry and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government significantly affect most, if not all, financial institutions, including regions. lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and investment, consumer income, consumer spending and savings, capital market activities, and competition among financial institutions, as well as customer preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing products in regions' market areas.
regions' business strategy is focused on providing a competitive mix of products and services, delivering quality customer service, and continuing to develop and optimize distribution channels that include a branch distribution network with offices in convenient locations, as well as electronic and mobile banking.
business segments regions provides traditional commercial, retail and mortgage banking services, as well as other financial services in the fields of asset management, wealth management, securities brokerage, and other specialty financing. regions carries out its strategies and derives its profitability from three reportable segments: corporate bank, consumer bank, and wealth management, with the remainder in other.
see note 22 "business segment information" to the consolidated financial statements for further information on regions' business segments.
non-gaap measures the table below presents computations of earnings and certain other financial measures, which excludes certain adjustments that are included in the financial results presented in accordance with gaap. these non-gaap financial measures include "adjusted net loan charge-offs", "adjusted net loan charge-offs as a percent of average loans, annualized", "adjusted non-interest expense", "adjusted non-interest income", "adjusted total revenue", and "adjusted total revenue, taxable-equivalent basis". regions believes that excluding certain items provides a meaningful base for period-to-period comparison, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the company and predicting future performance. these non-gaap financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of regions' business because management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations. regions believes that presentation of these non-gaap financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the company on the same basis as that applied by management. management and the board utilize these non-gaap financial measures as follows:
•preparation of regions' operating budgets
•monthly financial performance reporting
•monthly close-out reporting of consolidated results
•presentations to investors of company performance
•metrics for incentive compensation net loan charge-offs (gaap) are presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted net loan-charge offs (non-gaap). adjusted net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans (non-gaap) are calculated as adjusted net loan charge-offs (non-gaap) divided by average loans (gaap) and annualized. non-interest expense (gaap) is presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-gaap). net interest income (gaap) is presented with taxable-equivalent adjustments to arrive at net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis (gaap). non-interest income (gaap) is table of contents presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income (non-gaap). net interest income (gaap) and adjusted non-interest income (non-gaap) are added together to arrive at adjusted total revenue (non-gaap). net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis (gaap) and adjusted non-interest income (non-gaap) are added together to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-gaap).
non-gaap financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. although these non-gaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap. in particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to shareholders.
the following table provides: 1) a reconciliation of net loan charge-offs (gaap) to adjusted net loan charge-offs (non-gaap), 2) a computation of adjusted net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans, annualized (non-gaap). 3) a reconciliation of non-interest expense (gaap) to adjusted non-interest expense (non-gaap), 4) a reconciliation of non-interest income (gaap) to adjusted non-interest income (non-gaap), 5) a computation of adjusted total revenue (non-gaap), and 6) a computation of adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-gaap).

critical accounting estimates and related policies in preparing financial information, management is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses for the periods shown. the accounting principles followed by regions and the methods of applying these principles conform with gaap, regulatory guidance, where applicable, and general banking practices. estimates and assumptions most significant to regions are related primarily to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurements, intangible assets (goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets), residential msrs and income taxes, and are summarized in the following discussion and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses ("allowance") consists of two components: the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. unfunded credit commitments include items such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments. regions determines its allowance in accordance with gaap and applicable regulatory guidance.
see note 1 "summary of significant accounting policies" and note 5 "allowance for credit losses" to the consolidated financial statements for information about areas of judgment and methodologies used in establishing the allowance.
the allowance is sensitive to a number of internal factors, such as changes in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding, portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings. the allowance is also sensitive to external factors such as the general health of the economy, as evidenced by changes in interest rates, inflation, gdp, unemployment rates, changes in real estate demand and values, volatility in commodity prices, bankruptcy filings, health pandemics, government stimulus, and the effects of weather and natural disasters such as droughts, floods and hurricanes.
table of contents management considers these variables and all other available information when establishing the final level of the allowance. these variables and others have the ability to result in actual loan losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts.
changes in the factors used by management to determine the appropriateness of the allowance or the availability of new information could cause the allowance to be increased or decreased in future periods. in addition, bank regulatory agencies, as part of their examination process, may require changes in the level of allowance based on their judgments and estimates. volatility in certain credit metrics is to be expected. additionally, changes in circumstances related to individually large credits, commodity prices, or certain macroeconomic forecast assumptions may result in volatility. the scenarios discussed below, or other scenarios, have the ability to result in actual credit losses that differ, perhaps materially, from the originally estimated amounts. this analysis is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled loss estimates to reflect uncertainty and imprecision based on then-current circumstances and conditions.
it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one economic factor might affect the overall allowance because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in the allowance estimate. changes in the factors and inputs may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types. additionally, changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others. however, to consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate economic forecast, regions estimated the allowance using a scenario that was one standard deviation unfavorable to the expected scenario for each macroeconomic variable. this unfavorable scenario resulted in an allowance approximately 16 percent higher than the allowance using the expected scenario.
similar to the scenarios above, it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in credit risk factors might affect the overall allowance because of the wide variety of credit risk factors that are considered in estimating the allowance. changes in risk ratings may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across product or industry types. regions conducted a separate sensitivity analysis considering deteriorating conditions for commercial and investor real estate portfolio factors by stressing key portfolio drivers relative to the baseline portfolio conditions. regions stressed risk ratings by one downgrade for commercial and investor real estate loans. this scenario generated an increase in the modeled allowance of approximately $185 million for the commercial and investor real estate portfolios.
fair value measurements a portion of the company's assets and liabilities is carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded either in earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). these include debt securities available for sale, mortgage loans held for sale, equity investments (with and without readily determinable market values), residential msrs and derivative assets and liabilities. from time to time, the estimation of fair value also affects other loans held for sale, which are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. fair value determination is also relevant for certain other assets such as foreclosed property and other real estate, which are recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan/property or fair value, less estimated costs to sell the property. for example, the fair value of other real estate is determined based on recent appraisals by third parties and other market information, less estimated selling costs. adjustments to the appraised value are made if management becomes aware of changes in the fair value of specific properties or property types. the determination of fair value also impacts certain other assets that are periodically evaluated for impairment using fair value estimates, including goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets.
fair value is generally defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability (an entry price), in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. while management uses judgment when determining the price at which willing market participants would transact when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to "normal" market activity, management's objective is to determine the point within the range of fair value estimates that is most representative of a sale to a third-party investor under current market conditions. the value to the company if the asset or liability were held to maturity is not included in the fair value estimates.
a fair value measure should reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including the assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance. fair value is measured based on a variety of inputs the company utilizes. fair value may be based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets (level 1 valuations). if market prices are not available, quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market are used (level 2 valuations). where observable market data is not available, the valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market, but observable based on company-specific data (level 3 valuations). these unobservable assumptions reflect the company's own estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. valuation techniques typically include option table of contents pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques, but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability.
see note 1 "summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of determining fair value, including pricing validation processes.
intangible assets regions' intangible assets consist primarily of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses ("goodwill") and other identifiable intangible assets (primarily relationship assets and agency commercial real estate licenses). goodwill totaled $5.7 billion at both december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022. goodwill is allocated to each of regions' reportable segments (each a reporting unit: corporate bank, consumer bank, and wealth management). goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of october 1 or more often if events and circumstances indicate impairment may exist (refer to note 1 "summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion).
the company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1, 2023; the company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level to determine whether the fair value exceeded the carrying value. in performing the quantitative assessment, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was determined using a blend of both income and market approaches.
the results of the goodwill impairment test did not require regions to record a goodwill impairment charge as all three reporting units continued to have a fair value in excess of carrying value.
other identifiable intangible assets such as relationship assets and agency commercial real estate licenses are reviewed at least annually (usually in the fourth quarter) for events or circumstances which could impact the recoverability of the intangible asset. these events could include loss of customer relationships, increased competition, or adverse changes in the economy. to the extent an other identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable, an impairment loss would be recorded to reduce the carrying amount. these events or circumstances, if they occur, could be material to regions' operating results for any particular reporting period but the potential impact cannot be reasonably estimated. as of december 31, 2023, the company's review indicated there was no impairment in the value of the other identifiable intangible assets.
residential mortgage servicing rights regions has elected to measure and report its residential msrs using the fair value method. although sales of residential msrs do occur, residential msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable market prices and the exact terms and conditions of sales may not be readily available, and are therefore level 3 valuations in the fair value hierarchy previously discussed in the "fair value measurements" section. specific characteristics of the underlying loans greatly impact the estimated value of the related residential msrs. as a result, regions stratifies its residential mortgage servicing portfolio on the basis of certain risk characteristics, including loan type and contractual note rate, and values its residential msrs using discounted cash flow modeling techniques. these techniques require management to make estimates regarding future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration historical and forecasted residential mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates, escrow balances and servicing costs. changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds or other factors impact the fair value of residential msrs which impacts earnings. refer to note 6 "servicing of financial assets" to the consolidated financial statements for quantitative disclosures reflecting the effect that changes in management's assumptions would have on the fair value of residential msrs.

income taxes accrued income taxes are reported as a component of either other assets or other liabilities, as appropriate, in the consolidated balance sheets and reflect management's estimate of income taxes to be paid or received. the company is subject to income tax in the u.s. and multiple state and local jurisdictions. the tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction are complex and may be subject to different interpretations by the company and the relevant government taxing authorities. therefore, the company is required to exercise judgment in determining tax accruals and evaluating the company's tax positions, including evaluating uncertain tax positions.
deferred income taxes represent the amount of future income taxes to be paid or received and are accounted for using the asset and liability method with the net balance reported in other assets or other liabilities, as appropriate, in the consolidated balance sheets. the company determines the realization of deferred tax assets by considering all positive and negative evidence available, including the impact of recent operating results, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards and tax planning strategies. in projecting future taxable income, the company utilizes forecasted pre-tax earnings, adjusts for the estimated temporary differences and incorporates assumptions, including the amounts of income allocable to taxing jurisdictions. determining whether deferred tax assets are realizable is subjective and requires the use of significant judgment. a valuation allowance is provided when it is more-likely-
table of contents than-not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. the company currently maintains a valuation allowance for certain state carryforwards.
the company's estimate of accrued income taxes, deferred income taxes and income tax expense can also change in any period as a result of new legislative or judicial guidance impacting tax positions, as well as changes in income tax rates and changes in operating activities. any changes, if they occur, can be significant to the company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

operating results net interest income and net interest margin net interest income is regions' principal source of income and is one of the most important elements of regions' ability to meet its overall performance goals. in 2023, balance sheet and net interest income performance were the result of post-pandemic normalization and tightening monetary policy, including a higher interest rate environment. both net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by market interest rates and the fomc increased the fed funds rate by 100 basis points during the year ended december 31, 2023. see the "executive overview" for a discussion of recent fomc activity and expectations for 2024 net interest income that incorporates anticipated fomc activity.
net interest income (taxable-equivalent basis) increased by $538 million in 2023 compared to 2022, and net interest margin increased by 54 basis points to 3.90 percent in 2023. the increases in net interest income and net interest margin were driven primarily by significantly higher short-term and long-term market interest rates and average loan growth. the loan portfolio yield, inclusive of hedging impacts, increased to 5.86 percent in 2023 from 4.46 percent in 2022. the company's loan yields are primarily influenced by short-term interest rates such as 30-day term sofr, which averaged 4.98 percent in 2023 compared to 1.46 percent in 2022. additionally, fixed-rate lending production which contains significant residential mortgage fixed-rate exposure, benefited from higher middle and long-term rates. while the company temporarily slowed reinvestment within the investment securities portfolio for much of 2023, it had returned to full reinvestment by the fourth quarter. the investment securities portfolio benefited from rising rates, with the yield increasing to 2.38 percent in 2023 from 2.20 percent in 2022.
deposit and funding cost normalization, which are expected in a rising rate environment and were further influenced by bank industry stresses during the year, partially offset the increases in net interest income and net interest margin driven by loans and investment securities. in 2023, funding costs, which includes deposits and wholesale borrowings utilized during the year, increased to 1.19 percent compared to 0.23 percent in 2022. the increase in funding costs includes the impact of deposit remixing as depositors moved into higher interest earning products. deposit costs increased to 99 basis points for 2023 compared to 14 basis points for 2022.
additionally, net interest margin benefited from earning asset remixing out of cash balances held with the federal reserve bank, which are the primary component of interest-bearing deposits in other banks shown in table 2. in 2022, elevated cash balances were held to fund anticipated, post-pandemic deposit outflows, reducing the net interest margin in that period. cash balances largely returned to normal levels by the end of 2023.

notes:
•the change in interest not due solely to volume or yield/rate has been allocated to the volume column and yield/rate column in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each.
•the computation of taxable-equivalent net interest income is based on the statutory federal income tax rate of 21%, adjusted for applicable state income taxes net of the related federal tax benefit.
annual changes in net interest income are due to changes in the interest rate environment, product pricing, balance sheet mix, and balance sheet growth. over recent years, changes in the interest rate environment and the impact on product pricing and mix has been the primary contributor to changes in net interest income. the mix of earning assets can affect the interest rate spread. regions' primary types of earning assets are loans and investment securities. certain types of earning assets have historically generated larger spreads; for example, loans typically generate larger spreads than other assets, such as securities or interest-bearing deposits in other banks. average earning assets in 2023 totaled $137.9 billion, a decrease of $6.1 billion as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in interest-bearing deposits in other banks offset by a growth in loans, net of unearned income. see the "loans", "debt securities", and "cash and cash equivalents" sections for further details.
average loans as a percentage of average earning assets was 71 percent and 64 percent in 2023 and 2022, respectively. the remaining categories of earning assets are shown in table 2 "consolidated average daily balances and yield/rate analysis". the proportion of average earning assets to average total assets, which was 90 percent in both 2023 and 2022, measures the effectiveness of management's efforts to invest available funds into the most profitable earning instruments.
the mix of interest-bearing liabilities can also affect the interest spread. funding for regions' earning assets comes from interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing sources. as previously discussed, in 2023 the company experienced deposit balance declines and remixing into higher interest bearing deposit categories. as the percentage of earning assets funded by deposits declined during the year, the company utilized short and long-term wholesale borrowings. the changes to interest-bearing liabilities partially offset increases to net interest income and margin.
table of contents provision for (benefit from) credit losses the provision for credit losses is used to maintain the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit losses at a level that in management's judgment is appropriate to absorb expected credit losses over the contractual life of the loan and credit commitment portfolio at the balance sheet date. during 2023, the provision for credit losses totaled $553 million and net charge-offs were $397 million. this compares to a provision for credit losses of $271 million and net charge-offs of $263 million in 2022.
for further discussion and analysis of the total allowance for credit losses, see the "allowance for credit losses" and "risk management" sections found later in this report. see also note 5 "allowance for credit losses" to the consolidated financial statements.

nm - not meaningful
(1) in the third quarter of 2022, the company settled a previously disclosed matter with the cfpb. the company received an insurance reimbursement in the fourth quarter of 2022 related to the settlement.
service charges on deposit accounts service charges on deposit accounts include overdraft fees, treasury management fees and other customer transaction-related service charges, and, prior to mid-2022, non-sufficient fund fees. service charges decreased in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily as a result of overdraft-related policy enhancements that eliminated non-sufficient fund fees in mid-june 2022. additionally, in the second quarter of 2023, the company added an overdraft grace feature, which compliments the overdraft-related policy enhancements and contributed to the decrease. an increase in fees from treasury management services partially offset the overall decline in service charges.
on october 25, 2023, the federal reserve issued a proposal for public comment that, if finalized, would lower the maximum interchange fee that a large debit card issuer can receive for a debit card transaction. under the proposed rule the maximum interchange fee would be subject to adjustments every other year based upon issuer cost data. the company is studying the proposal and evaluating its impact.
on january 17, 2024, the cfpb issued a proposal for public comment that, if finalized, would cap overdraft fees in line with established benchmarks ranging between $3-$14 or their actual costs. alternatively, an institution could calculate its own fee to break even. the company is studying the proposal and evaluating its impact.
capital markets income capital markets income primarily relates to capital raising activities that include securities underwriting and placement, loan syndication, as well as foreign exchange, derivatives, merger and acquisition and other advisory services. capital markets income decreased in 2023 compared to 2022, driven primarily by negative credit/debit valuation adjustments in 2023 due to rate and spread movements. to a lesser degree, capital markets income was negatively impacted by declines in merger and acquisition advisory services and syndication revenue. partially offsetting these decreases were increases in securities underwriting and placement fees and real estate capital markets revenue in 2023 compared to 2022.
table of contents mortgage income mortgage income is generated through the origination and servicing of residential mortgage loans for long-term investors and sales of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. the decrease in mortgage income in 2023 was due primarily to lower mortgage production and sales as a result of higher market interest rates. the decrease was also a result of amortization of mortgage servicing rights. additionally, mortgage income for 2022 included approximately $12 million in gains associated with the re-securitization and sale of ginnie mae loans previously repurchased from their pools. partially offsetting the declines was an increase in servicing income associated with a bulk purchase of the rights to service $6.2 billion of residential mortgage loans in the third quarter of 2023.
investment services fee income investment services fee income represents income earned from investment advisory services. investment services fee income increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to the rising interest rate environment, which has driven increases in fixed annuity rates and the related investment income. also contributing were increases in assets under management due to additional financial advisors.
bank-owned life insurance bank-owned life insurance income primarily represents income earned from the appreciation of the cash surrender value of insurance contracts held and the proceeds of insurance benefits. bank-owned life insurance income increased during 2023 compared to 2022 driven primarily by improvement in underlying crediting rates as a result of an overall increase in interest rates.
market value adjustments on employee benefit assets market value adjustments on employee benefit assets are the reflection of market value variations related to assets held for certain employee benefits. the adjustments are offset in salaries and benefits and other non-interest expense.
insurance proceeds insurance proceeds recognized in 2022 were related to the settlement of a previously disclosed matter with the cfpb.
other miscellaneous income other miscellaneous income includes net revenue from affordable housing, valuation adjustments to equity investments, fees from safe deposit boxes, check fees and other miscellaneous income. net revenue from affordable housing includes actual gains and losses resulting from the sale of affordable housing investments, cash distributions from the investments and any related impairment charges.

nm - not meaningful salaries and employee benefits salaries and employee benefits consist of salaries, incentive compensation, long-term incentives, payroll taxes, and other employee benefits such as 401(k), pension, and medical, life and disability insurance, as well as, expenses from liabilities held table of contents for employee benefit purposes. salaries and employee benefits increased during 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to increases in base salaries, higher benefit expenses, and, to a lesser degree, an increase in severance costs in the second half of the year. these increases were offset by a decline in incentive compensation. full-time equivalent headcount was relatively flat at december 31, 2023 as compared to december 31, 2022.
professional, legal and regulatory expenses professional, legal, and regulatory expenses consist of amounts related to legal, consulting, other professional fees and regulatory charges. professional, legal, and regulatory expenses decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to a settled matter with the cfpb in 2022. see note 23 "commitments, contingencies and guarantees" in the annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022 for more detail.
fdic insurance assessments fdic insurance assessments increased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily resulting from a special assessment recorded in 2023 (discussed below) and a two basis point increase in the quarterly assessment rate schedules charged to all financial institutions effective for the first quarter of 2023.
federal law requires that any losses to the fdic's dif related to the protection of uninsured depositors under the systemic risk exception be repaid by a special assessment on idis. in the fourth quarter of 2023, the fdic finalized a special assessment related to the two march 2023 bank failures, totaling an estimated $16.3 billion. the rule requires the estimated amount of the entire special assessment be recognized as the accrual of a liability and related expense in the fourth quarter of 2023 pursuant to accounting guidance. the special assessment for regions is estimated at approximately $119 million to be paid in eight quarterly installments beginning in the first quarter of 2024, which was accrued in the fourth quarter and should be deductible for income taxes.
operational losses operational losses include losses related to fraud, execution, delivery and process management, and damage to physical assets. operational losses increased in 2023 compared to 2022 due to elevated check-related fraud losses experienced primarily during the second and third quarters of 2023.
other miscellaneous expenses other miscellaneous expenses include expenses related to communications, postage, supplies, certain credit-related costs, foreclosed property expenses, mortgage repurchase costs, and other costs (benefits) related to employee benefit plans. other miscellaneous expenses increased in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to higher non-service based pension-related expenses and, to a lesser degree, higher fees associated with licenses and taxes.
income taxes the company's income tax expense for the year ended 2023 was $533 million compared to $631 million for the same period in 2022, resulting in effective tax rates of 20.5% and 22.0%, respectively. the decrease in the effective tax rate for 2023 is due to lower pre-tax income for the year as compared to 2022 causing the impact of tax preferential items to increase, as well as increased tax benefits related to investments in affordable housing in 2023 as compared to 2022. see the "executive overview" for the company's expectations for the 2024 effective tax rate.
the effective tax rate is affected by many factors including, but not limited to, the level of pre-tax income, the mix of income between various tax jurisdictions with differing tax rates, enacted tax legislation, net tax benefits related to affordable housing investments, bank-owned life insurance income, tax-exempt interest and nondeductible expenses. in addition, the effective tax rate is affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period-to-period, such as the termination of certain leveraged leases, share-based payments, valuation allowance changes and changes to unrecognized tax benefits. accordingly, the comparability of the effective tax rate between periods may be impacted.
at december 31, 2023, the company reported a net deferred tax asset of $741 million compared to $943 million at december 31, 2022. the change in the net deferred tax position was due primarily to the deferred tax impact of decreases in unrealized losses on securities for sale and derivative instruments arising during the period.

cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents totaled $6.8 billion compared to $11.2 billion at december 31, 2022. the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in cash balances on deposit with the federal reserve bank driven by an expected decline in deposits and growth in loans. see the "loans", "deposits", and "liquidity" sections for more information.
debt securities debt securities available for sale, comprising 21 percent of earning assets, constitute approximately 97 percent of the securities portfolio. regions maintains a highly-rated securities portfolio consisting primarily of agency mbs. regions' investment policy emphasizes credit quality and liquidity. debt securities rated in the highest category by nationally recognized rating agencies and debt securities backed by the u.s. government and government sponsored agencies, both on a direct and indirect basis, represented approximately 96 percent of the investment portfolio at december 31, 2023. all other debt securities rated below aaa, not backed by the u.s. government or government sponsored agencies, or which are not rated represented approximately 4 percent of total debt securities at december 31, 2023. debt securities increased $124 million from year-end 2022, as detailed below in table 6 . in 2023, regions temporarily slowed reinvestment but returned to full reinvestment in the fourth quarter of 2023.
the average life of the debt securities portfolio at december 31, 2023 was estimated to be 5.5 years, with a duration of approximately 4.5 years. these metrics compare with an estimated average life of 5.8 years and a duration of approximately 4.8 years for the portfolio at december 31, 2022.
debt securities are an important tool used to manage interest rate sensitivity and provide a primary source of liquidity for the company, as much of the portfolio is highly liquid. additionally, some of the securities portfolio is eligible to be used as collateral for funding of various types of borrowings. see the "liquidity" section for more information on these arrangements. see note 3 "debt securities" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. also see the "market risk-interest rate risk" section for more information.

residential first mortgage residential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a residence. these loans are typically financed over a 15 to 30 year term and, in most cases, are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence. total residential first mortgage loans increased $1.4 billion in comparison to year-end 2022 balances, driven by approximately $2.8 billion in new loan originations retained on the balance sheet in 2023.
home equity lines home equity lines are secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower's residence and allow customers to borrow against the equity in their homes. home equity lines decreased $289 million in comparison to year-end 2022 balances, as payoffs and paydowns continue to outpace production. substantially all of this portfolio was originated through regions' branch network.
beginning in december 2016, new home equity lines of credit have a 10-year draw period and a 20-year repayment term. during the 10-year draw period customers do not have an interest-only payment option, except on a very limited basis. from may 2009 to december 2016, home equity lines of credit had a 10-year draw period and a 10-year repayment term. prior to may 2009, the predominant structure was a 20-year draw period with a balloon payment upon maturity. the term "balloon payment" means there are no principal payments required until the balloon payment is due for interest-only lines of credit.
table of contents the following table presents information regarding the future principal payment reset dates for the company's home equity lines of credit as of december 31, 2023. the balances presented are based on maturity date for lines with a balloon payment and draw period expiration date for lines that convert to a repayment period.

consumer credit quality data the company calculates an estimate of the current value of property secured as collateral for both residential first mortgage and home equity lending products ("current ltv"). the estimate is based on home price indices compiled by a third party. the third party data indicates trends for msas. regions uses the third party valuation trends from the msas in the company's footprint in its estimate. the trend data is applied to the loan portfolios taking into account the age of the most recent valuation and geographic area.
the following table presents current ltv data for components of the residential first mortgage, home equity lines and home equity loans classes of the consumer portfolio segment. current ltv data for some loans in the portfolio is not available due to mergers and systems integrations. the amounts in the table represent the entire loan balance. for purposes of the table below, if the loan balance exceeds the current estimated collateral the entire balance is included in the "above 100%" category, regardless of the amount of collateral available to partially offset the shortfall.

consumer credit card consumer credit card lending represents primarily open-ended variable interest rate consumer credit card loans.
other consumer-exit portfolios other consumer-exit portfolios include lending initiatives through third parties consisting of loans made through automotive dealerships and other point of sale lending. regions ceased originating new loans related to these businesses prior to 2020 and therefore the portfolio balances have been in run-off. additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2023, the company sold substantially all of its unsecured consumer loans in this portfolio totaling approximately $300 million, which was the primary driver of the $527 million decrease from year-end 2022.
other consumer other consumer loans primarily include indirect and direct consumer loans, overdrafts and other revolving loans. other consumer loans increased $548 million from year-end 2022 primarily driven by increases in consumer home improvement loans.
regions considers factors such as periodic updates of fico scores, unemployment, home prices, and geography as credit quality indicators for consumer loans. fico scores are obtained at origination and refreshed fico scores are obtained by the company quarterly for most consumer loans. for more information on credit quality indicators refer to note 5 "allowance for credit losses".
allowance the allowance consists of two components: the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments. the allowance totaled $1.7 billion as of december 31, 2023 compared to $1.6 billion at december 31, 2022, which represents management's best estimate of expected losses over the life of the loan and credit commitment portfolios. key drivers of the change in the allowance by quarter are presented in table 16 below. while many of these items overlap regarding impact, they are included in the category most relevant.

in deriving any forecast, regions benchmarks its internal forecast with external forecasts and external data available. regions' december 2023 baseline forecast indicated overall improvement compared to the september 2023 forecast. slower table of contents growth in consumer spending and reduced business investment in equipment, machinery and structures were drags on real gdp growth in the fourth quarter of 2023. the trend of job growth is slowing, and the baseline forecast anticipates further deceleration into 2024. the unemployment rate is expected to increase modestly over the forecast horizon, with the increase constrained by the labor force participation rate remaining below pre-pandemic levels. as measured by cpi, inflation is expected to slow further but remain above the fomc's 2.0 percent target through 2024. the risks to the baseline forecast are considered to be balanced. see the economic environment in regions' banking markets discussion in the "executive overview" section for additional information.
credit metrics are monitored throughout each quarter in order to understand external macro-views, trends and industry outlooks, as well as regions' internal specific views of credit metrics and trends. in the fourth quarter of 2023, asset quality continued to normalize, as expected. commercial and investor real estate criticized balances increased approximately $492 million, which included an increase in classified balances of $135 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. non-performing loans, excluding held for sale, and non-performing assets increased approximately $163 million and $164 million, respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2023. total net charge-offs increased by 14 basis points to 0.54% of average loans; however, excluding the impact of charge-offs associated with the fourth quarter sale of unsecured consumer loans, adjusted net charge-offs (non-gaap) decreased one basis point compared to the third quarter of 2023. see table 1 "gaap to non-gaap reconciliations" for further details, and table 20 for more details regarding non-performing assets.
while regions' quantitative allowance methodologies strive to reflect all risk factors, any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some level of imprecision. the qualitative framework has a general imprecision component which is meant to acknowledge that model and forecast errors are inherent in any modeling estimate. in the fourth quarter of 2023, the general imprecision remained stable.
based upon the factors discussed above, the december 31, 2023 allowance increased compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to adverse risk migration and continued credit normalization, as well as a build in qualitative adjustments for incremental risk in higher risk portfolios (see further discussion in table 20 below). based on the overall analysis performed, management deemed an allowance of $1.7 billion to be appropriate to absorb expected credit losses in the loan and credit commitment portfolios as of december 31, 2023.
net charge-offs increased $134 million year-over-year, primarily driven by an increase in commercial and industrial net charge-offs resulting from expected normalization. the increase in other consumer-exit portfolios charge-offs includes $35 million in net charge-offs from the sale of unsecured consumer loans. additionally, net charge-offs for 2022 include $63 million in net charge-offs in the other consumer portfolio due to the sale of unsecured consumer loans. see table 1 "gaap to non-gaap reconciliations" for further details. as noted, economic trends such as interest rates, unemployment, volatility in commodity prices, collateral valuations and inflationary pressure will impact the future levels of net charge-offs and may result in volatility of certain credit metrics in 2024 and beyond. see the "executive overview" section for details on expectations for net charge-offs in 2024.

(1)excludes accruing loans 90+ days past due.
(2)excludes residential first mortgage loans that are 100% guaranteed by the fha and all guaranteed loans sold to ginnie mae where regions has the right but not the obligation to repurchase. total 90+ days or more past due guaranteed loans excluded were $34 million at december 31, 2023 and $34 million at december 31, 2022.
non-performing loans at december 31, 2023 increased $305 million as compared to year-end 2022 levels as a result of continued asset quality normalization and downgrades within industries previously identified as higher risk such as information, healthcare, transportation and warehousing, and office industries partially offset by improvement in agriculture. the same economic trends that impact net charge-offs, as discussed above, will impact the future level of non-performing assets. circumstances related to individually large credits could also result in volatility.

other earning assets other earning assets consist primarily of investments in federal reserve bank and fhlb stock, marketable equity securities, and other miscellaneous earning assets. the balance at december 31, 2023 totaled $1.4 billion, increasing from $1.3 billion at december 31, 2022 primarily due to an increase in marketable equity securities partially offset by a decline in certificates of deposits held at other institutions. refer to note 7 "other earning assets" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
residential mortgage servicing rights at fair value residential msrs increased approximately $94 million from december 31, 2022 to december 31, 2023. the year-over-year increase was primarily due to a bulk purchase of the rights to service $6.2 billion of residential mortgage loans in the third quarter of 2023. partially offsetting the increase was higher amortization of servicing rights. an analysis of residential msrs is presented in note 6 "servicing of financial assets" to the consolidated financial statements.
deposits regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a share of the deposit market. regions' ability to compete in the deposit market depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the company meets customers' needs. regions employs various means to meet those needs and enhance competitiveness, such as providing a high level of customer service, competitive pricing and convenient branch locations for its customers. regions also serves customers through providing centralized, high-quality banking services through the company's digital channels and contact center.
deposits are regions' primary source of funds, providing funding for 92 percent of average earning assets in 2023 and 95 percent of average earning assets in 2022. regions' deposit base composition is a key component of the company's franchise value. table 22 "deposits" provides a year-over-year comparison of deposit balances on a period-ending basis.
the cost of deposits rose in 2023 as expected in an elevated interest rate environment. deposit costs increased to 99 basis points for 2023, compared to 14 basis points for 2022. the rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased to 156 basis points in 2023 compared to 25 basis points for 2022. the increase in deposit costs also reflected remixing as customers moved into higher interest-bearing categories. see the "market risk-interest rate risk" section for further discussion of these balances.

____
(1) other deposits represent non-customer balances primarily consisting of wholesale funding (for example, eurodollar trade deposits, selected deposits and brokered time deposits).
(2) includes brokered deposits totaling $2.4 billion at december 31, 2023 and $1.2 billion at december 31, 2022.
total deposits at december 31, 2023 decreased approximately $4.0 billion compared to year-end 2022 levels, with all deposit categories and segments impacted by remixing as customers continued to exhibit rate-seeking behavior. non-interest-bearing demand products decreased $9.0 billion to $42.4 billion and represented 33 percent of total deposits at year-end 2023 compared to 39 percent at year-end 2022. interest-bearing checking also decreased $1.2 billion to $24.5 billion at year-end 2023 and accounted for 19 percent of total deposits at year-end 2023 and 2022. savings accounts decreased $3.1 billion to $12.6 billion at year-end 2023 and accounted for 10 percent of total deposits at year-end 2023 compared to 12 percent at year-end 2022. money market balances remained stable compared to the prior year.
growth in time deposits partially offset decreases in other categories with time deposit balances increasing $9.2 billion to $15.0 billion in 2023, as customers moved into higher interest rate products. the increase in time deposit balances also reflects additional brokered deposits in the other segment entered into to maintain diversified funding sources. time deposits represented 12 percent of total deposits at year-end 2023 compared to 4 percent at year-end 2022.
regions' deposits are granular and diversified including insured and collateralized deposits, with consumer deposits making up more than 60 percent of the total deposit base. furthermore, corporate deposits include those that are operational in nature (where the primary use is certain operational services such as clearing, custody, payments or other cash management activities). a significant amount of the company's deposit base is insured by the fdic or collateralized, with approximately $11.2 billion in deposits collateralized in public funds or in trusts at december 31, 2023. the amount of estimated uninsured deposits totaled $47.8 billion at december 31, 2023, therefore over 60 percent of total deposits are insured by the fdic. the company's deposits are also granular in nature as evidenced by an average deposit account balance of approximately $18 thousand at december 31, 2023. the estimates of uninsured deposits and average account size were based on methodologies used in the company's call report, which is prepared on an unconsolidated bank basis.

table of contents borrowed funds total long-term borrowings increased approximately $46 million to $2.3 billion at december 31, 2023 due entirely to valuation adjustments. regions and regions bank did not issue or redeem any debt in 2023.
during 2023, the company utilized short-term and long-term fhlb borrowings as a part of its liquidity management. all of these borrowings were redeemed prior to year-end resulting in a $4 million pre-tax gain associated with the extinguishment. funding from the fhlb and federal reserve bank is secured by pledged assets, primarily certain loan portfolios which are also subject to blanket lien arrangements with the fhlb and federal reserve bank. as of december 31, 2023, regions' blanket lien arrangements with these entities covered a total loan balance of approximately $95 billion and included loans from various loan portfolios. however, borrowing capacity with the fhlb and federal reserve bank is contingent on a subset of the blanket lien portfolios which are eligible and pledged according to the parameters for each counterparty.

(1) on february 1, 2024, dbrs announced plans to withdraw the credit ratings on regions financial corporation and its bank subsidiary, regions bank, on or about march 4, 2024 due to business reasons; however, dbrs may elect to continue coverage based on investor feedback.
as part of an industry-wide evaluation, on august 7, 2023, moody's affirmed all long-term and short-term ratings and updated the outlook to negative from stable reflecting several sources of strain on the u.s. banking sector.
in general, ratings agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, probability of government support, and level and quality of earnings. any downgrade in credit ratings by one or more ratings agencies may impact regions in several ways, including, but not limited to, regions' access to the capital markets or short-term funding, borrowing cost and capacity, collateral requirements, and acceptability of its letters of credit, thereby potentially adversely impacting regions' financial condition and liquidity. see the "risk factors" section of this annual report on form 10-k for more information.
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. additional information on the credit rating ranking within the overall classification system is located on the website of each credit rating agency.
shareholders' and total equity shareholders' equity was $17.4 billion at december 31, 2023 as compared to $15.9 billion at december 31, 2022. during 2023, net income increased shareholders' equity by $2.1 billion, cash dividends on common stock reduced shareholders' equity by $822 million, and cash dividends on preferred stock reduced shareholders' equity by $98 million. changes in aoci increased shareholders' equity by $531 million, primarily due to available for sale securities and derivative instruments as a result of changes in market interest rates during 2023. common stock repurchased during 2023 decreased shareholders' equity by $252 million. these shares were immediately retired upon repurchase and therefore were not included in treasury stock. the cumulative effect from the adoption of new accounting guidance that eliminated tdrs and created modifications to troubled borrowers increased shareholders' equity by $28 million.
total equity includes noncontrolling interest of $64 million and $4 million at december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, respectively. the noncontrolling interest represents the unowned portion of a low income housing tax credit fund syndication, of which regions held the majority interest at december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022.
table of contents subsequent to december 31, 2023, the company purchased 4.3 million shares of common stock for $79 million through february 21, 2024. these shares were immediately retired upon repurchase and therefore were not included in treasury stock.
see note 14 "shareholders' equity and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" section for additional information.
regulatory requirements capital rules regions and regions bank are required to comply with regulatory capital requirements established by federal and state banking agencies. these regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the company's assets, liabilities and selected off-balance sheet items, and also qualitative judgments by the regulators. failure to meet minimum capital requirements can subject the company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions. under the basel iii rules, regions is designated as a standardized approach bank. regions is a "category iv" institution under the federal reserve's tailoring rules.
federal banking agencies allowed a phase-in of the impact of cecl on regulatory capital. at december 31, 2021, the add-back to regulatory capital was calculated as the impact of initial adoption, adjusted for 25 percent of subsequent changes in the allowance. the amount is phased-in over a three-year period beginning in 2022. at december 31, 2023, the net impact of the addback on cet1 was approximately $204 million or approximately 16 basis points. the add-back amount will decrease by approximately $100 million each year, or approximately 8 basis points, in the first quarters of 2024 and 2025.
regions participates in supervisory stress testing conducted by the federal reserve and its scb is currently floored at 2.5 percent. see note 14 "shareholders' equity and accumulated other comprehensive income" to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding ccar results.
see the "executive overview" section for details on expectations for cet1.
in july 2023, u.s. federal banking regulators issued a proposal for long-term debt requirements that, if finalized, would require the company to maintain minimum long-term debt requirements. if the proposal becomes effective, banks would be allowed a three-year phase-in period. the company is studying the proposal and evaluating its impact.
in august 2023, the u.s. banking regulators proposed new rules for u.s. implementation of capital requirements under basel iv rules, more recently referred to as the basel iii "endgame". these proposed rules include broad-based changes to the risk weighting framework for various credit exposures and operational risk capital requirements. the company is studying the proposals and evaluating their impacts.
additional discussion of the basel iii rules, their applicability to regions, recent proposals and final rules issued by the federal banking agencies and recent laws enacted that impact regulatory requirements is included in the "supervision and regulation" subsection of the "business" section. additional discussion and a tabular presentation of the applicable holding company and bank regulatory capital requirements is included in note 12 "regulatory capital requirements and restrictions" to the consolidated financial statements.
liquidity regions maintains a robust liquidity management framework designed to effectively manage liquidity risk in accordance with sound risk management principals and regulatory expectations. the framework establishes sustainable processes and tools to effectively identify, measure, mitigate, monitor, and report liquidity risks beginning with regions' liquidity management policy and the liquidity risk appetite statements approved by the board. processes within the liquidity management framework include, but are not limited to, liquidity risk governance, cash management, liquidity stress testing, liquidity risk limits, contingency funding plans, and collateral management. while the framework is designed to comply with liquidity regulations, the processes are further tailored to be commensurate with regions' operating model and risk profile.
see the "supervision and regulation-liquidity regulation" subsection of the "business" section, the "risk factors" section and the "liquidity" section for more information.
risk management regions is exposed to various risks as part of the normal course of operations. the exposure to risk requires sound risk management practices that comprise an integrated and comprehensive set of programs and processes that apply to the entire company. accordingly, regions has established a risk management framework to manage risks and provide reasonable assurance of the achievement of the company's strategic objectives.
the primary risk exposures identified and managed through the company's risk management framework are market risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, operational risk, legal risk, compliance risk, reputational risk and strategic risk.

•market risk is the risk to the company's financial condition resulting from adverse movements in market rates or prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates or equity prices.
•liquidity risk is the potential that the company will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding (referred to as "funding liquidity risk") or the potential that the company cannot easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions (referred to as "market liquidity risk").
•credit risk is the risk that arises from the potential that a borrower or counterparty will fail to perform on an obligation.
•operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events.
•legal risk is defined as the risk associated with the failure to meet regions' legal obligations from legislative, regulatory, or contractual perspectives.
•compliance risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules, or regulations, or from non-conformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures, or ethical standards.
•reputational risk is the potential that negative publicity regarding the company's business practices, whether true or not, will cause a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions.
•strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience from adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating environment.
several of these primary risk exposures are expanded upon further within the remaining sections of management's discussion and analysis.
regions' risk management framework outlines the company's approach for managing risk that includes the following four components:
•collaborative risk culture - a strong, collaborative risk culture is fundamental to the company's core values and operating principles. it ensures focus on risk in all activities and encourages the necessary mindset and behavior to enable effective risk management and promote sound risk-taking within the bounds of the company's risk appetite. the company's risk culture requires that risks be promptly identified, escalated, and challenged; thereby, benefiting the overall performance of the company. sustaining a collaborative risk culture is critical to the company's success and is a clear expectation of executive management and the board.
•sound risk appetite - the company's risk appetite statements define the types and levels of risk the company is willing to take to achieve its objectives.
•sustainable risk processes - effective risk management requires sustainable processes and tools to effectively identify, measure, mitigate, monitor, and report risk.
•responsible risk governance - governance serves as the foundation for comprehensive management of risks facing the company. it outlines clear responsibility and accountability for managing, monitoring, escalating, and reporting both existing and emerging risks.
clearly defined roles and responsibilities are critical to the effective management of risk and are central to the four components of the company's approach to risk management. regions utilizes the three lines of defense concept to clearly designate risk management activities within the company.
•1st line of defense activities include the proactive identification, management (including mitigation and risk acceptance), and ownership of risks.
•2nd line of defense activities provide for objective oversight of the company's risk-taking activities and assessment of the company's aggregate risk levels.
•3rd line of defense activities provide for independent reviews and assessments of risk management practices across the company.
the board provides the highest level of risk management governance. the principal risk management functions of the board are to oversee processes for evaluating the adequacy of internal controls, risk management, financial reporting and compliance with laws and regulations. the board has designated an audit committee of outside directors to focus on oversight of management's establishment and maintenance of appropriate disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting. see the "financial disclosures and internal controls" section of management's discussion and analysis for additional information. the board has also designated a risk committee of outside directors to focus on regions' overall risk profile. the risk committee annually approves an enterprise risk appetite statement that reflects core business principles and strategic vision by including quantitative limits and qualitative statements that are organized by risk type. this statement is table of contents designed to be a high-level document that sets the tone for the board's risk appetite, which is the maximum amount of risk the company is willing to accept in pursuit of its business objectives. by establishing boundaries around risk taking and business decisions, and by incorporating the needs and goals of its shareholders, regulators, customers and other stakeholders, the company's risk appetite is aligned with its strategic priorities and goals.
the risk management group, led by the company's chief risk officer, ensures the consistent application of regions' risk management approach within the structure of the company's operating, capital and strategic plans. the primary activities of the risk management group include:
•interpreting internal and external signals that point to possible risk issues for the company;
•identifying risks and determining which company areas and/or products will be affected;
•ensuring there are mechanisms in place to specifically determine how risks will affect the company as a whole and the individual area and or product;
•assisting business groups in analyzing trends and ensuring company areas have appropriate risk identification and mitigation processes in place; and
•reviewing the limits, parameters, policies, and procedures in place to ensure the continued appropriateness of risk controls.
as part of its ongoing assessment process, the risk management group makes recommendations to management and the risk committee of the board regarding adjustments to these controls as conditions or risk tolerances change. in addition, the internal audit division provides an independent assessment of the company's internal control structure and related systems and processes.
management, with the assistance of the risk management group, follows a formal process for identifying, measuring and documenting key risks facing each business group and determining how those risks can be controlled or mitigated, as well as how the controls can be monitored to ensure they are effective. the risk committee receives reports from management to ensure operations are within the limits established by the enterprise risk appetite statement.
some of the more significant processes used by management to manage and control risks are described in the remainder of this report. external factors beyond management's control may result in losses despite the risk management group's efforts.
effects of inflation the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature; therefore, a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies, which have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories that are greatly impacted by inflation. while the implications differ for a bank, inflation does have influence on the growth of total assets and deposits in the banking industry and the resulting level of profitability and capitalization. inflation also affects the level of market interest rates, and therefore, the pricing of financial instruments.
management believes the most significant potential impact of inflation on financial results is a direct result of regions' ability to manage the impact of changes in interest rates. the company's interest rate risk positioning was mostly neutral as of december 31, 2023, and therefore, net interest income increases or declines only modestly from higher or lower interest rates. hedging activity has reduced the exposure to net interest income late in the rising interest rate cycle as intended. refer to table 25 "interest rate sensitivity" for additional details on regions' interest rate sensitivity.
additionally, inflation has the potential to impact credit risk. periods of inflation could influence asset prices and business input costs which could affect the ability of borrowers to repay loans. the company has sound credit risk management practices to maintain a credit portfolio through the economic cycle. refer to the "credit risk" section for further details on regions' credit risk management process.
effects of deflation a period of deflation would affect all industries, including financial institutions. deflation potentially could lead to lower profits, higher unemployment, lower production and deterioration in overall economic conditions. in addition, deflation could depress economic activity and impair bank earnings through reduced balance sheet growth and less favorable product pricing, as well as impairment in the ability of borrowers to repay loans.
management believes the most significant potential impact of deflation on financial results relates to regions' ability to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to cushion against future market and credit related losses. however, the company can utilize certain risk management tools to help it maintain its balance sheet strength even if a deflationary scenario were to develop.
table of contents market risk-interest rate risk regions' primary market risk is interest rate risk. this includes uncertainty with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest rate levels, which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the company offers. as its primary tool to analyze this risk, regions measures the change in its net interest income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario. net interest income sensitivity to market rate movements is a useful short-term indicator of regions' interest rate risk.
in addition to net interest income simulations, regions also utilizes an eve analysis as a measurement tool to estimate risk exposure over a longer-term horizon. eve measures the extent to which the economic value of assets, liabilities and derivative instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. importantly, eve values only the current balance sheet, excluding the growth assumptions used in net interest income sensitivity analyses. additionally, the results are highly dependent on imprecise assumptions for products with embedded prepay optionality and indeterminate maturities. the uncertainty surrounding important assumptions used in eve analysis may limit its efficacy.
sensitivity measurement-financial simulation models are regions' primary tools used to measure interest rate exposure. using a wide range of sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates. models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of regions' balance sheet. assumptions are made about the direction and magnitude of interest rate movements, the slope of the yield curve, and the changing composition of the balance sheet that results from both strategic plans and customer behavior. among the assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition, the pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the characteristics of future business. interest rate-related risks are expressly considered, such as pricing spreads, the pricing of deposit accounts, prepayments and other option risks. regions considers these factors, as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior.
the primary objective of asset/liability management at regions is to coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to sustain reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest rate cycles. in computing interest rate sensitivity, regions compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using "market forward rates." see the "executive overview" section for details on expectations for net interest income in 2024. the set of alternative interest rate scenarios includes instantaneous parallel rate shifts of various magnitudes. in addition to parallel rate shifts, multiple curve steepening and flattening scenarios are contemplated. regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements phased in over a six-month period that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements.
exposure to interest rate movements-regions' balance sheet is naturally asset sensitive, with net interest income increasing with higher interest rates, and decreasing with lower interest rates. this is the result of approximately half of the loan portfolio floating contractually with market rate indices, and funding from a large, mostly stable retail deposit portfolio. importantly, the stability and rate sensitivity of regions' deposit portfolio has been proven over multiple interest rate cycles. with this natural balance sheet profile, the ability to utilize discretionary asset duration strategies within the investment portfolio and through derivative hedges is critical in mitigating the bank's naturally asset sensitive position.
as of december 31, 2023, regions evidenced a mostly balanced, or "neutral" asset/liability position, with an asset duration of approximately 2.6 years and a liability duration of approximately 2.8 years, using historically-informed approximations. the securities portfolio duration was approximately 4.5 years and is appropriate for regions' risk profile in order to offset the long-duration deposit liabilities. while the derivative hedging portfolio is recorded on the balance sheet including current unrealized losses, deposit value increases have more than offset these losses through the rising rate environment. the additional value of deposits in a higher rate environment is realized in the form of lower-cost funding when compared with wholesale sources. while balance sheet analysis, particularly eve analysis, does contemplate the economic value of deposits, the estimated fair value of deposits is equal to their carrying value for certain financial statement footnote disclosures, consistent with industry practices. see note 21 "fair value measurements" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
as of december 31, 2023, regions' net interest income profile was mostly neutral to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts as compared to the base case for the 12-month measurement horizon ending december 2024. the estimated exposure associated with the rising and falling rate scenarios in table 25 below reflects the combined impacts of movements in short-term and long-term interest rates. an increase or reduction in short-term interest rates (such as the fed funds rate, the rate of interest on excess reserves, and sofr) will drive the yield on assets and liabilities contractually tied to such rates higher or lower. in either scenario, it is expected that changes in funding costs and balance sheet hedging income will offset the change in asset yields, resulting in little change to net interest income.
net interest income remains exposed to intermediate and long-term yield curve tenors. while this was a headwind to net interest income during a low rate environment, it represents a tailwind to net interest income growth as the yield curve rises and remains elevated. elevated, or increasing intermediate and long-term interest rates (such as intermediate to longer-term u.s. treasuries, swaps and mortgage rates) will drive yields higher on certain fixed-rate, newly originated or renewed loans, increase table of contents prospective yields on certain investment portfolio purchases, and reduce amortization of premium expense on existing securities in the investment portfolio. the opposite is true in an environment where intermediate and long-term interest rates fall.
the interest rate sensitivity analysis presented below in table 25 is informed by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the progression of the balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the scenarios of instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve. though there are many assumptions which affect the estimates for net interest income, those pertaining to deposit pricing, deposit mix and overall balance sheet composition are particularly impactful. given the uncertainties associated with monetary policy on industry liquidity levels and the cost of that liquidity, management evaluates the impacts from these key assumptions through sensitivity analysis. sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and should not be considered predictive of future results.
the company's baseline balance sheet assumptions include management's best estimate for balance sheet changes in the coming 12 months. in 2023, regions experienced a decline in deposit balances, both from the normalization of balances acquired from stimulative policies, as well as from late-cycle rate seeking behavior by higher-balance customers, yet those declines slowed during the second half of the year. the baseline scenario projects deposit balances to be stable to modestly lower over the forecast horizon. additional deposit balance outflow of $1 billion would reduce net interest income by $21 million over 12 months in the parallel, instantaneous +100 basis point scenario in table 25. conversely, if an additional $1 billion are retained, a positive benefit of $21 million would be expected over 12 months in the parallel, instantaneous +100 basis point scenario table 25.
while the base case estimates mostly stable deposit balances in aggregate, additional remixing of approximately $2 billion to $3 billion out of low-cost deposit categories and into high-cost deposit categories is anticipated through mid-2024. in rising rate scenarios only, management assumes that the mix of deposits will further change versus the base case as informed by analyses of prior rate cycles. currently, however, much of the anticipated mix shift has already occurred or is expected to occur within the baseline scenario, mitigating the amount of additional remixing in higher rate scenarios. the magnitude of the remixing shift is rate dependent and equates to approximately $1.6 billion over 12 months in the parallel, instantaneous +100 basis point scenario in table 25. furthermore, over the 12 month horizon, an increase of $1 billion in deposit remixing would decrease net interest income by approximately $27 million, and a decrease of $1 billion in deposit remixing would increase net interest income by $27 million in the parallel, instantaneous +100 basis point scenario.
the interest-bearing deposit beta is calibrated using the experience from prior rate cycles and is dynamic across both interest rate level and time. the base case scenario anticipates a peak in deposit rates by mid-year 2024. the parallel, instantaneous +100 basis point shock scenario in table 25 incorporates an incremental beta between 40 and 45 percent when compared to the base case scenario, while the parallel, instantaneous -100 basis point shock scenario incorporates an incremental beta between 35 and 40 percent when compared to the base case scenario. incremental deposit pricing outperformance or underperformance of 5 percent in a parallel, instantaneous 100 basis point shock would increase or decrease net interest income by approximately $42 million.
the table below summarizes regions' positioning over the next 12 months in various parallel yield curve shifts (i.e., including all yield curve tenors). the scenarios are inclusive of all interest rate hedging activities. more information regarding hedges is disclosed in table 26 and its accompanying description.

(2)all active cash flow hedges, including forward starting hedges, are reflected within the measurement horizon. see table 27 for additional information regarding hedge start and maturity dates.
table of contents regions' comprehensive interest rate risk management approach uses derivatives and debt securities to manage its interest rate risk position.
during the fourth quarter of 2023, the company added $250 million of 3 year maturity, forward starting swaps hedging floating rate loan cash flows, with a receive fixed rate of 3.26 percent becoming active in 2028. additionally, the company added $1.2 billion of pay fixed fair value swaps on available for sale securities and $252 million of receive fixed fair value swaps on brokered cds. the pay fixed fair value swaps had a weighted average fixed rate of 4.9 percent with a weighted average maturity of fourteen months, and the received fixed fair value swaps had a weighted average fixed rate of 4.9 percent with a weighted average maturity of twelve months. all trades were executed with overnight sofr as the floating leg benchmark rate.
subsequent to december 31, 2023, the company terminated approximately $500 million of receive fixed cash flow swaps with a fixed rate of 2.86% and original maturity of january 2025.
interest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of regions' securities portfolio, which can directly impact the carrying value of shareholders' equity.
derivatives-regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity. alco, which consists of members of regions' senior management team, in its oversight role for the management of interest rate sensitivity, approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies. derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with customer derivatives, which include interest rate, credit, and foreign exchange risks. the most common derivatives regions employs are forward rate contracts, forward sale commitments, futures contracts, interest rate swaps, interest rate options (caps, floors and collars), and contracts with a combination of these instruments.
forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at a future date at a specified price or yield. futures contracts subject regions to market risk associated with changes in interest rates. because futures contracts are cash settled daily, there is minimal credit risk associated with futures. interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for variable (or vice versa) streams of interest payments. the notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of interest settlements. interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price and time. forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreed-upon price. foreign currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency for another on a specified date and at a specified rate. these contracts are executed on behalf of the company's customers and are used by customers to manage fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. the company is subject to the credit risk that another party will fail to perform.
regions has made use of interest rate swaps and options in balance sheet hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate funding position to a variable-rate position, to effectively convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt securities available for sale portfolio to a variable-rate position, and to effectively convert a portion of its floating-rate loan portfolios to fixed-rate. regions also uses derivatives to economically manage interest rate and pricing risk associated with its mortgage origination business. in the period of time that elapses between the origination and sale of mortgage loans, changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a decline in the value of the loans in this held-for-sale portfolio. futures contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect the value of the loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in interest rates and pricing.

regions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer transactions. for non-dealer transactions, the need for collateral is evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the financial strength of the counterparty. credit risk is also reduced significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements. when there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place, the exposure represents the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from and/or posted to that counterparty. most hedging interest rate swap derivatives traded by regions are subject to mandatory clearing. the counterparty risk for cleared trades effectively moves from the executing broker to the clearinghouse allowing regions to benefit from the risk mitigation controls in place at the respective clearinghouse. the "credit risk" section in this report contains more information on the management of credit risk.
regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers. interest rate swaps, interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most common derivatives sold to customers. other derivative instruments with similar characteristics are used to hedge market risk and minimize volatility associated with this portfolio. instruments used to service customers are held in the trading account, with changes in value recorded in the consolidated statements of income.
the primary objective of regions' hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes, from an economic perspective, on net interest income and other financing income and the net present value of its balance sheet. the overall effectiveness of these hedging strategies is subject to market conditions, the quality of regions' execution, the accuracy of its valuation assumptions, counterparty credit risk and changes in interest rates.
see note 20 "derivative financial instruments and hedging activities" to the consolidated financial statements for a tabular summary of regions' year-end derivatives positions and further discussion.
table of contents regions accounts for residential msrs at fair market value with any changes to fair value being recorded within mortgage income. regions enters into derivative transactions to economically mitigate the impact of market value fluctuations related to residential msrs. derivative instruments entered into in the future could be materially different from the current risk profile of regions' current portfolio.
liquidity liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of regions and affects regions' ability to meet the needs of the company and its customers. regions' goal in liquidity management is to maintain diverse liquidity sources and reserves sufficient to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, under normal and stressed conditions. accordingly, regions maintains a variety of liquidity sources to fund its obligations, as further described below. see also note 23 "commitments, contingencies and guarantees" to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the company's funding requirements. furthermore, regions performs specific procedures, including scenario analyses and stress testing to evaluate and maintain appropriate levels of available liquidity in alignment with liquidity risk.
regions' operation of its business provides a generally balanced liquidity base which is comprised of customer assets, consisting principally of loans, and funding provided by customer deposits and borrowed funds. maturities in the loan portfolio provide a steady flow of funds, and are supplemented by regions' deposit base.
cash reserves, liquid assets and secured borrowing capabilities aid in the management of liquidity in normal and stressed conditions, and/or meeting the need of contingent events such as obligations related to potential litigation. as part of its normal management practice, regions maintains collateral and operational readiness to utilize secured funding sources such as the fhlb and the federal reserve bank on a same-day basis (subject to any practical constraints affecting these market participants). while the securities portfolio is a primary source of liquidity, the secured borrowing capabilities, in addition to cash reserves on hand, assist in alleviating the company's need to sell securities for funding purposes. liquidity needs can also be met by borrowing funds in national money markets, though regions does maintain limits on short-term unsecured funding due to the volatility that can affect such markets.
the following table summarizes the company's available sources of liquidity as of december 31, 2023:

(1) includes small in transit items that may not yet be reflected in the fed master account closing balance.
(2) unencumbered investment securities comprise securities that are eligible as collateral for secured transactions through market channels or are eligible to be pledged to the fhlb or the federal reserve discount window.
the balance with the federal reserve bank is the primary component of the balance sheet line item "interest-bearing deposits in other banks." at december 31, 2023, regions had approximately $4.2 billion in cash on deposit with the federal reserve bank and other depository institutions, a decrease from approximately $9.2 billion at december 31, 2022, partially driven by the expected decline in deposits during the period. refer to the "cash and cash equivalents" and "deposits" sections for more information.
the securities portfolio also serves as a primary source and storehouse of liquidity. proceeds from maturities and principal and interest payments of securities provide a continual flow of funds available for cash needs (see note 3 "debt securities" to the consolidated financial statements). furthermore, the highly liquid nature of the available for sale securities portfolio (for example, the agency guaranteed mbs portfolio) can be readily used as a source of cash through various secured borrowing arrangements. regions' securities portfolio consists of u.s. treasury securities, federal agency securities, mbs and corporate and other debt. in evaluating the liquidity within the securities portfolio, unencumbered investment securities are primarily comprised of u.s treasury securities and agency mbs. unencumbered investment securities also includes certain corporate bonds considered to be highly liquid and other securities, primarily non-agency commercial mbs.
regions' financing arrangement with the fhlb adds additional flexibility in managing the company's liquidity position. as of december 31, 2023, regions had borrowing capacity as shown in table 28 and no outstanding borrowings. fhlb borrowing capacity was determined based on eligible securities and loan amounts, as of december 31, 2023, that can be pledged as collateral for future borrowing capacity. additionally, investment in fhlb stock is required in relation to the level of outstanding borrowings. the fhlb has been and is expected to continue to be a reliable and economical source of funding.
table of contents regions has additional borrowing availability with the federal reserve bank through the discount window as shown in table 28. federal reserve bank borrowing capacity is determined based on eligible loan amounts that can be used as collateral for future borrowing capacity.
regions maintains a shelf registration statement with the sec that can be utilized by regions to issue various debt and/or equity securities. additionally, regions' board has authorized regions bank to issue up to $10 billion in aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one time. refer to note 11 "borrowed funds" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
regions may, from time to time, consider opportunistically retiring outstanding issued securities, including subordinated debt in privately negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common shares. regulatory approval would be required for retirement of some instruments. see note 14 "shareholders' equity and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
regions' liquidity policy requires the holding company to maintain cash sufficient to cover the greater of (1) 18 months of debt service and other cash needs or (2) a minimum cash balance of $500 million. cash and cash equivalents at the holding company totaled $1.9 billion at december 31, 2023. overall liquidity risk limits are established by the board through its risk appetite statement and liquidity policy. the company's board, lroc and alco regularly review compliance with the established limits.
libor transition and reference rate reform the company successfully transitioned from libor to alternative reference rates by june 30, 2023. impacted instruments were transitioned in accordance with the libor act with certain instruments transitioning on applicable reset dates through june 30, 2024. as part of this transition, the company applied certain optional expedients and exceptions allowed in previously adopted accounting relief for hedges.
in the fourth quarter of 2023, bloomberg index services limited announced the permanent cessation of the bsby index and all tenors effective november 15, 2024. regions is in the process of evaluating exposure to bsby and planning for cessation, and will not rely on accounting relief during transition.
market risk-prepayment risk regions, like most financial institutions, is subject to changing prepayment speeds on mortgage-related assets under different interest rate environments. prepayment risk is a significant risk to earnings and specifically to net interest income. for example, mortgage loans and other financial assets may be prepaid by a borrower, so that the borrower may refinance its obligations at lower rates. as loans and other financial assets prepay in a falling rate environment, regions must reinvest these funds in lower-yielding assets. prepayments of assets carrying higher rates reduce regions' interest income and overall asset yields. conversely, in a rising rate environment, these assets will prepay at a slower rate, resulting in opportunity cost by not having the cash flow to reinvest at higher rates. prepayment risk can also impact the value of securities and the carrying value of equity. regions' greatest exposures to prepayment risks primarily rest in its mbs portfolio, the mortgage fixed-rate loan portfolio and the residential msr, all of which tend to be sensitive to interest rate movements. each of these assets is also exposed to prepayment risk due to factors which are not necessarily the result of interest rates, but rather due to changes in policies or programs related, either directly or indirectly, to the u.s. government's governance over certain lending and financing within the mortgage market. such policies can work to either encourage or discourage financing dynamics and represent a risk that is extremely difficult to forecast and may be the result of non-economic factors. the company attempts to monitor and manage such exposures within reasonable expectations while acknowledging all such risks cannot be foreseen or avoided. further, regions has prepayment risk that would be reflected in non-interest income in the form of servicing income on the residential msrs. regions actively monitors prepayment exposure as part of its overall net interest income forecasting and interest rate risk management.
credit risk regions' objective regarding credit risk is to maintain a credit portfolio that provides for stable credit costs with acceptable volatility through an economic cycle. regions has various processes to manage credit risk as described below. in order to assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio, regions considers risk factors within the loan portfolio segments and classes, the current u.s. economic environment and that of its primary banking markets, as well as counterparty risk. see the "portfolio characteristics" section found earlier in this report for further information regarding the risk characteristics of each loan type. see further discussion of the current u.s. economic environment in the "economic environment in regions' banking markets" section.
table of contents management process credit risk is managed by maintaining a sound credit risk culture, throughout all lines of defense, which ensures that the levels and types of risk taken are aligned with regions' credit risk appetite. the credit quality of borrowers and counterparties has a significant impact on regions' earnings; however, the nature of the risk differs by each of the defined businesses which engage in multiple forms of commercial, investor real estate and consumer lending. regions categorizes the credit risks it faces by asset quality, counterparty exposure, and diversification levels which provides a structure to assess credit risk and guides credit decision-making. credit policies, another key component of regions' culture, are designed and adjusted, as needed, to promote sound credit risk management. these policies guide lending activities in a manner consistent with regions' strategy and provide a framework for achieving asset quality and earnings objectives.
effective credit risk management requires coordinated identification, measurement, mitigation, monitoring and reporting of credit risk exposure, credit quality, and emerging risk trends. accordingly, regions has implemented a credit risk governance structure that provides oversight from the board to the organizational units in order to maintain open channels of communication.
occasionally, borrowers and counterparties do not fulfill their obligations and regions must take steps to mitigate and manage losses. teams are in place to appropriately identify and manage nonperforming loans, collections, loan modifications, and loss mitigation efforts. regions maintains an allowance for credit losses that management considers adequate to absorb expected losses in the portfolio.
for a discussion of the process and methodology used to calculate the allowance for credit losses refer to the "critical accounting estimates and related policies" section found earlier in this report, note 1 "summary of significant accounting policies" and note 5 "allowance for credit losses" to the consolidated financial statements. details regarding the allowance for credit losses, including an analysis of activity from the previous year's total, are included in table 18 "allowance for credit losses". also, refer to table 19 "allowance allocation" for details pertaining to management's allocation of the allowance to each loan category.
responsibility and accountability for effectively managing all risks, including credit risk, in the various business units lies with the first line of defense. risk management, in the second line of defense, oversees, assesses and effectively challenges the risk-taking activities of the first line of defense. finally, credit risk review provides ongoing oversight, as a third line of defense function, of the credit portfolios to ensure regions' activities, and controls, are appropriate for the size, complexity and risk profile of the company.
counterparty risk counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction or contract could be unable or unwilling to fulfill its contractual or legal obligations. exposure may be to a financial institution (such as a commercial bank, an insurance company, a broker dealer, etc.) or a corporate client.
regions has a centralized approach to approval, management, and monitoring of counterparty exposure. the counterparty risk management group is responsible for the independent credit risk management of financial institution counterparties and their affiliates. market risk management is responsible for the measurement and stress testing of counterparty exposures. the corporate and commercial credit groups are responsible for the independent credit risk management of client side counterparties.
financial institution exposure may result from a variety of transaction types generated in one or more departments of the company. aggregate exposure limits are established to manage the exposure generated by various areas of the company. counterparty client credit risk arises when regions sells a risk management product to hedge risks in the client's business. exposures to counterparties are aggregated across departments and regularly reported to senior management.
information security risk regions faces information security risks, such as evolving and adaptive cyber-attacks that are conducted regularly against financial institutions in attempts to compromise or disable information systems. in the event of a cyber-attack or other data breach, regions may be required to incur significant expenses, including with respect to remediation costs, costs of implementing additional preventative measures, addressing any reputational harm and addressing any related regulatory inquiries or civil litigation arising from the event.
see part i item1c. cybersecurity found earlier in this report for further information.
table of contents financial disclosure and internal controls regions maintains internal controls over financial reporting, which generally include those controls relating to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap. regions' process for evaluating internal controls over financial reporting starts with understanding the risks facing each of its functions and areas, how those risks are controlled or mitigated, and how management monitors those controls to ensure that they are in place and effective. these risks, control procedures and monitoring tools are documented in a standard format. this format not only documents the internal control structures over all significant accounts, but also places responsibility on management for establishing feedback mechanisms to ensure that controls are effective.
regions also has processes to ensure appropriate disclosure controls and procedures are maintained. these controls and procedures as defined by the sec are generally designed to ensure that financial and non-financial information required to be disclosed in reports filed with the sec is reported within the time periods specified in the sec's rules and forms, and that such information is communicated to management, including the ceo and cfo, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
regions' disclosure review committee, which includes representatives from the legal, tax, finance, risk management, accounting, investor relations, and treasury departments, meets quarterly to review recent internal and external events to determine whether all appropriate disclosures have been made in reports filed with the sec. in addition, the ceo and cfo meet quarterly with the sec filings review committee, which includes senior representatives from accounting, legal, risk management, treasury, and the business groups. the sec filings review committee provides a forum in which senior executives disclose to the ceo and cfo any known significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in regions' internal controls over financial reporting, and provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements and other contents of the company's form 10-k and 10-q filings are accurate, complete, and timely. as part of this process, certifications of internal control effectiveness are obtained from regions' associates who are responsible for maintaining and monitoring effective internal controls over financial reporting. these certifications are reviewed and presented to the ceo and cfo as support of the company's assessment of internal controls over financial reporting. the form 10-k is presented to the audit committee of the board of directors for approval, and the forms 10-q are reviewed by the audit committee. financial results and other financial information are also reviewed with the audit committee on a quarterly basis.
as required by sections 302 and 906 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, the ceo and the cfo review and make certifications regarding the accuracy of regions' periodic public reports filed with the sec, as well as the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. with the assistance of the financial review committees noted in the previous paragraph, regions continually assesses and monitors disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, and makes refinements as necessary.

refer to the "2022 results" and "operating results" sections of management's discussion and analysis of the annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, for comparisons of 2022 with 2021.

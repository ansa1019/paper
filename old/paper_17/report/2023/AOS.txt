item 1a - risk factors in the ordinary course of our business, we face various strategic, operating, compliance and financial risks. these risks could have an impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. the risks set forth below are not an exhaustive list of potential risks but reflect those that we believe to be material. you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k, including the documents incorporated by reference, before making an investment decision regarding our common stock. if any of the events contemplated by the following risks were to actually occur, then our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. as a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
economic and industry risks
■the effects of global and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business a decline in economic activity, such as a recession or economic downturn, in the u.s. and other regions in the world in which we do business, could further adversely affect consumer confidence and spending patterns which could result in decreased demand for the products we sell, a delay in purchases, increased price competition, slower adoption of energy-efficient water heaters and boilers, or high-quality water treatment products, which could negatively impact our profitability and cash flows. such deterioration in economic conditions could arise from many factors or fears including public health crises, political instability or risk of government default. in addition, an increase in price levels generally or in particular industries (such as the inflation in steel prices in 2021 and the recent inflation in other material and logistics costs), could result in a consumer shift away from the products we offer, which could adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. a deterioration in economic conditions also could negatively impact our vendors and customers, which could result in an increase in bad debt expense, customer and vendor bankruptcies, interruption or delay in supply of materials, or increased material prices, which could negatively impact our ability to distribute, market and sell our products and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
■the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events, including natural disasters, political disruptions, terrorist attacks, public health issues, and acts of war, could significantly disrupt production, or impact consumer spending as a global company with a large international footprint, we are subject to increased risk of damage or disruption to us and our employees, facilities, suppliers, distributors, or customers. extraordinary events, including natural disasters, resulting from but not limited to climate change, political disruptions, terrorist attacks, public health issues, such as the covid-19 pandemic, and acts of war may disrupt our business and operations and impact our supply chain and access to necessary raw materials or could adversely affect the economy generally, resulting in a loss of sales and customers. any of these disruptions or other extraordinary events outside of our control that impact our operations or the operations of our suppliers and key distributors could affect our business negatively, harming operating results.
natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities. for example, two of our manufacturing plants are located within a floodplain that has experienced past flooding events. we also have other manufacturing facilities located in hurricane and earthquake zones. we maintain insurance coverage and have taken steps to mitigate these physical risks related to natural disasters and extreme weather conditions. although we installed an approximately 7,000-foot-long berm, flood gates, and pumping stations around our ashland city, tennessee facility, our largest manufacturing facility, to mitigate the risk of flooding, there is still the potential for natural disasters and extreme weather conditions to disrupt the productivity of our facilities.
apart from the potential impact on our operations, these types of events also could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or depending on the severity, globally, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
■our business could be adversely impacted by changes in consumer purchasing behavior, consumer preferences, technological changes, and market trends consumer preferences for products and the methods in which they purchase products are constantly changing based on, among other factors, cost, performance, convenience, environmental and social concerns and perceptions. consumer purchasing behavior may shift the product mix in the markets in which we participate or result in a shift to other distribution channels, for example e-commerce. consumer preferences and broader trends, such as decarbonization and electrification efforts in response to climate change, may result in reduced demand for gas or fossil fuel-powered products and increased demand for higher efficiency products and/or more electric powered products. in addition, technologies are ever changing. our ability to respond to these trends, timely transition our product portfolio, develop new and innovative products, and acquire and protect the necessary intellectual property rights is essential to our continued success, but cannot reasonably be assured. it is possible that we will not be able to develop new technologies, products or distribution channels, or do so on a timely basis, to align with consumer purchasing behavior and consumer preferences, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
■our operations could be adversely impacted by material and component price volatility, as well as supplier concentration the market prices for certain materials and components we purchase, primarily steel, have been volatile. in recent years we have also experienced inflation-related increases in our transportation and other costs. significant increases in the cost of any of the key materials and components we purchase would increase our cost of doing business and ultimately could lead to lower operating earnings if we are not able to recover these cost increases through price increases to our customers. historically, there has been a lag in our ability to recover increased material costs from customers, and that lag, could negatively impact our profitability. in some cases, we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for some of the raw materials and components we require in the manufacturing of our products. a significant disruption or termination of the supply from one of these suppliers could delay sales or increase costs which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
■because we participate in markets that are highly competitive, our revenues and earnings could decline as we respond to competition we sell all of our products in highly competitive and evolving markets. we compete in each of our targeted markets based on product design, reliability, quality of products and services, advanced technologies, product performance, maintenance costs and price. some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, research and development and distribution resources than we have; others may invest little in technology or product development but compete on price and the rapid replication of features, benefits, and technologies, and some are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing or geographic footprints. new technologies and new competitors have developed and continue to develop in certain markets in which we participate, such as gas tankless and heat pump technologies in north america. while we design and manufacture these and other products, we cannot assure that our products will continue to compete successfully with those of our current competitors and new market participants and it is possible that we will not be able to retain our customer base or improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers. there is also increasing use of data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence software, which our competitors may be able to use more effectively or implement more successfully than we are able to do. failure to adapt to the evolving competitive environment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
■because approximately 22 percent of our sales in 2023 were attributable to china, adverse economic conditions or changes in consumer behavior in china could impact our business our sales in china increased four percent in local currency in 2023 compared to 2022. our 2022 sales in china were impacted by lower consumer demand driven by covid-19 related disruptions. we derive a substantial portion of our sales in china from premium-tier products. changes in consumer preferences and purchasing behaviors including preferences for e-commerce and manufacturer emphasis on brand ecosystems and connectivity, weakening consumer confidence and sentiment, as well as economic uncertainty, sociopolitical and demographic risks, and increased competition from chinese-based companies may prompt chinese consumers to postpone purchases, choose lower-priced products or different alternatives, or lengthen the cycle of replacement purchases. further deterioration in the chinese economy may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
business, operational, and strategic risks
■we sell our products and operate outside the u.s., and to a lesser extent, rely on imports and exports, which may present additional risks to our business approximately 33 percent of our sales in 2023 were attributable to products sold outside of the u.s., primarily in china and canada, and to a lesser extent in europe and india. we also have operations and business relationships outside the u.s. that comprise a portion of our manufacturing, supply, and distribution. approximately 5,000 of our 12,000 employees as of december 31, 2023 were located in china. at december 31, 2023, approximately $292 million of cash and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries, substantially all of which were located in china. international operations generally are subject to various risks, including: political, religious, and economic instability; local labor market conditions; new or increased tariffs or other trade restrictions, or changes to trade agreements; the impact of foreign government regulations, actions or policies; the effects of income taxes; governmental expropriation; the changes or imposition of statutory restrictions which prohibit repatriation of cash; the imposition or increases in withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries; labor relations problems; the imposition of environmental or employment laws, or other restrictions or actions by foreign governments; and differences in business practices. unfavorable changes in the political, regulatory, or trade climate, diplomatic relations, or government policies, particularly in relation to countries where we have a presence, including canada, china, india and mexico, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows or our ability to repatriate funds to the u.s.
■a material loss, cancellation, reduction, or delay in purchases by one or more of our largest customers could harm our business sales to our five largest customers represented approximately 42 percent of our sales in 2023. we expect that our customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future. our concentration of sales to a relatively small number of customers makes our relationships with each of these customers important to our business. we cannot assure that we will be able to retain our largest customers. some of our customers may shift their purchases to our competitors in the future. our customers may experience financial instability, affecting their ability to make or pay for future purchases. further, a customer may be acquired by a customer of a competitor which could result in our loss of that customer. the loss of one or more of our largest customers, any material reduction or delay in sales to these customers, or our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
■a portion of our business could be adversely affected by a decline in north american new residential or commercial construction or a decline in replacement-related volume of water heaters and boilers, including a decline in demand for commercial spaces residential new construction activity in north america and industry-wide replacement-related volume of water heaters had growth in 2023 after a decline in 2022. new residential housing starts in the u.s. are projected to be approximately flat in 2024 compared to 2023. commercial construction activity in north america grew in 2023, although at a slower rate than 2022. we believe that the significant majority of the markets we serve are for the replacement of existing products, and residential water heater replacement volume have been strong. as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, businesses and commercial spaces have experienced and may experience in the future, fluctuation in demand and in occupancy that may reduce demand for our products, and commercial sectors, such as the restaurant and hospitality industries in which we have customers, may experience long-term shifts in consumer behavior which could negatively impact demand or capacity and may not return to pre-pandemic levels. in addition, the acceptance of remote work arrangements could negatively impact demand for commercial construction. changes in the replacement volume and in the construction market in north america could negatively affect us.
■an inability to adequately maintain our information systems and their security, as well as to protect data and other confidential information, could adversely affect our business and reputation in the ordinary course of business, we utilize information systems for day-to-day operations, to collect and store sensitive data and information, including our proprietary and regulated business information and personally identifiable information of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information about our employees. our information systems are susceptible to outages due to system failures, cybersecurity threats, failures on the part of third-party information system providers, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, viruses, fraud, theft, malicious actors or breaches of security. like many companies, we, and some third parties upon which we rely, have experienced cybersecurity incidents and attacks on information technology networks and systems, products and services in the past but, to date, none have resulted in a material breach or had a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. we may experience such incidents and attacks in the future, potentially with increasing frequency from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. in addition, as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, remote work and remote access to our systems have increased, which may heighten these risks. use of artificial intelligence software may also create risks from unintentional disclosure of proprietary, confidential, personal or otherwise sensitive information. although we have a response plan in place in the event of a data breach and we have an active program to maintain and improve data security and address these risks and uncertainties by implementing and improving internal controls, security technologies, insurance programs, network and data center resiliency and recovery processes, a successful attack in the future could result in operations failure or breach of security that could lead to disruptions of our business activities and the loss or disclosure of both our and our customers' financial, product and other confidential information and could result in regulatory actions, significant expense and litigation and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and our reputation.
■our international operations are subject to risks related to foreign currencies we have a significant presence outside of the u.s., primarily in china and canada and to a lesser extent europe, mexico, and india, and therefore, hold assets, including $197 million of cash and marketable securities denominated in chinese renminbi, incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the u.s. dollar. the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars in our consolidated financial statements. furthermore, typically our products are priced in foreign countries in local currencies. as a result, we are subject to risks associated with operating in foreign countries, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, or global exchange rate instability or volatility that strengthens the u.s. dollar against foreign currencies. an increase in the value of the u.s. dollar relative to the local currencies of our foreign markets, particularly in china, has negatively affected our sales, profitability, and cash and cash equivalents balances and could have such effects in the future. in 2023, the change in foreign currencies negatively impacted our sales and cash and cash equivalents by approximately $56 million and $13 million, respectively. in addition to currency translation risks, we incur a currency transaction risk whenever one of our subsidiaries enters into a purchase or sale transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiaries' functional currency. the majority of our foreign currency transaction risk results from sales of our products in canada, a portion of which we manufacture in the u.s., and to a lesser extent from component purchases in europe and india and payroll in mexico. these risks may adversely impact our reported sales and profits in the future or negatively impact revenues and earnings translated from foreign currencies into u.s. dollars.
■our business may be adversely impacted by product defects product defects can occur through our own product development, design and manufacturing processes or through our reliance on third parties for component design and manufacturing activities. we may incur various expenses related to product defects, including product warranty costs, product liability and recall or retrofit costs. while we maintain a reserve for product warranty costs based on certain estimates and our knowledge of current events and actions, our actual warranty costs may exceed our reserve, resulting in current period expenses and a need to increase our reserves for warranty charges. in addition, product defects and recalls may diminish the reputation of our brand. further, our inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line or the temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market. any of these events may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
■potential acquisitions could use a significant portion of our capital and we may not successfully integrate future acquisitions or operate them profitably or achieve strategic objectives we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions, and we could use a significant portion of our available capital to fund future acquisitions. we may not be able to successfully integrate future acquired businesses or operate them profitably or accomplish our strategic objectives for those acquisitions. if we complete any future acquisitions in new geographies, our unfamiliarity with relevant regulations and market conditions may impact our ability to operate them profitably or achieve our strategic objectives for those acquisitions. our level of indebtedness may increase in the future if we finance acquisitions with debt, which would cause us to incur additional interest expense and could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and limit our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing. the impact of future acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
legal, regulatory, and governance risks
■changes in regulations or standards, such as those associated with climate change, could adversely affect our business our products are subject to a wide variety of statutory, regulatory, codes and industry standards and requirements related to, among other items, energy and water efficiency, environmental emissions, labeling and safety. for example, the department of energy (doe) has adopted a new efficiency rule for commercial water heaters that will take effect in 2026. in addition, there are proposed federal rule makings that would require our residential water heater product line to be more energy efficient as well as the establishment of a national drinking water standard regulating per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (pfas), which could affect the demand for our water filtration products. there are also a number of federal, foreign, state and local governments adopting laws, regulations and codes in response to climate change that require a transition to non-fossil fuel based sources of energy production as well as significantly reducing or eliminating the on-site combustion of fossil fuels in the building sector, such as limiting or prohibiting the delivery of natural gas in new construction. we believe our products are currently efficient, safe and environment-friendly. however, a significant change to regulatory or code requirements that promote a transition to alternative energy sources as a replacement for gas, or a significant shift in industry standards, could substantially increase manufacturing costs, capital expenditures, transportation costs and raw material costs, alter distribution channels, attract new competitors, impact the size and timing of demand for our products, affect the types of products we are able to offer or put us at a competitive disadvantage, any of which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
■we are subject to u.s. and global laws and regulations covering our domestic and international operations that could adversely affect our business and results of operations due to our global operations, we are subject to many laws governing international relations, including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and restrict where we can do business, what information or products we can supply to certain countries and what information we can provide to a non-u.s. government, including but not limited to the foreign corrupt practices act and the u.s. export administration act. violations of these laws may result in criminal penalties or sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
■our environmental, social, and governance (esg) commitments could result in additional costs, and our inability to achieve them could have an adverse impact on our reputation and performance we periodically communicate our strategies, commitments and targets related to esg matters, including carbon emissions, water usage, diversity and inclusion, and human rights through the issuance of our esg report. although we intend to meet these strategies, commitments and targets and are committed to advancing sustainable innovations in our industry, we may be unable to achieve them due to impacts on resources, operational costs, and technological advancements. failure to meet these sustainability requirements or targets could adversely impact our reputation as well as the demand for our products and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, standards and processes for measuring and reporting carbon emissions and other sustainability metrics may change over time, result in inconsistent data, or result in significant revisions to our strategies, commitments and targets, or our ability to achieve them. any scrutiny of our carbon emissions or other sustainability disclosures or our failure to achieve related strategies, commitments and targets could negatively impact our reputation or performance.
■our results of operations may be negatively impacted by product liability lawsuits and claims our products expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, sale and use of our products. while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms, that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities or that our insurance providers will be able to ultimately pay all insured losses. in addition, we self-insure a portion of product liability claims. a series of successful claims against us could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
■we have significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and an impairment of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets could cause a decline in our net worth our total assets include significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. our goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase prices we paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets we acquired. we assess whether there have been impairments in the value of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant. if future operating performance at our businesses does not meet expectations, we may be required to reflect non-cash charges to operating results for goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments. the recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material. a significant reduction in our stockholders' equity due to an impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets may affect our ability to maintain the debt-to-capital ratio required under our existing debt arrangements. we have identified the valuation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as a critical accounting policy. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - critical accounting policies-goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets" included in item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k.
■certain members of the founding family of our company and trusts for their benefit have the ability to influence all matters requiring stockholder approval we have two classes of common equity: our common stock and our class a common stock. the holders of common stock currently are entitled, as a class, to elect only one-third of our board of directors. the holders of class a common stock are entitled, as a class, to elect the remaining directors. certain members of the founding family of our company and trusts for their benefit (smith family) have entered into a voting trust agreement with respect to shares of our class a common stock and shares of our common stock they own. as of december 31, 2023, through the voting trust, these members of the smith family own approximately 66.2 percent of the total voting power of our outstanding shares of class a common stock and common stock, taken together as a single class, and approximately 96.9 percent of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our class a common stock, as a separate class. due to the differences in the voting rights between shares of our common stock (one-tenth of one vote per share) and shares of our class a common stock (one vote per share), the smith family voting trust is in a position to control to a large extent the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote, including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or approval of transactions involving a change of control. this ownership position may increase if other members of the smith family enter into the voting trust agreement, and the voting power relating to this ownership position may increase if shares of our class a common stock held by stockholders who are not parties to the voting trust agreement are converted into shares of our common stock. the voting trust agreement provides that, in the event one of the parties to the voting trust agreement wants to withdraw from the trust or transfer any of its shares of our class a common stock, such shares of our class a common stock are automatically exchanged for shares of our common stock held by the trust to the extent available in the trust. in addition, the trust will have the right to purchase the shares of our class a common stock and our common stock proposed to be withdrawn or transferred from the trust. as a result, the smith family members that are parties to the voting trust agreement have the ability to maintain their collective voting rights in our company even if certain members of the smith family decide to transfer their shares.
item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our company is comprised of two reporting segments: north america and rest of world. our rest of world segment is primarily comprised of china, europe and india. both segments manufacture and market comprehensive lines of residential and commercial gas, heat pump and electric water heaters, boilers, tanks, and water treatment products. both segments primarily manufacture and market in their respective region of the world.
we saw improvement in our supply chain during 2022, particularly in the second half of the year, which continued through 2023. we remain in close contact with our suppliers and logistics providers to resolve supply chain constraints as they arise.
we continue to seek acquisitions that enable geographic growth, expand our core business, and establish adjacencies. we will also continue to look for opportunities to add to our existing operations in high growth regions demonstrated by our previous introductions of water treatment products in india and kitchen products including our recently introduced dishwashers and steam ovens, in china. we also launched our internally designed and manufactured gas tankless water heaters in early 2024. in addition we are expanding our commercial water heater capacity in preparation for the 2026 commercial regulatory change.
in our north america segment, we saw resilient demand in the residential water heater industry in 2023 after three years of uneven growth, primarily related to the impacts of covid-19-related supply chain constraints. proactive replacement remained above historical levels in 2023 and we project that will continue in 2024. we believe that new home construction remains in a deficit and we expect it will be flat in 2024 compared to 2023. considering these factors, we project 2024 industry residential unit volumes will be approximately flat after approximately six percent growth in 2023. we believe that commercial water heater industry volumes will grow low single digits in 2024 compared to 2023 as demand for commercial electric water heaters greater than 55 gallon continues a positive trend toward pre-2022 levels. sales of our boilers and water treatment products were negatively impacted by elevated channel inventories in 2023. we believe that channel inventories were at near normal levels at the end of 2023 for both product categories. we expect to see an eight to ten percent increase in our sales of boilers in 2024 compared to 2023 as we continue to benefit from the transition to higher efficiency boilers. we anticipate sales of our north america water treatment products will increase approximately ten to 12 percent in 2024, compared to 2023, as we expect our sales to grow at approximately two times the market.
in our rest of world segment, we saw a return to growth in china as our sales increased four percent in local currency in 2023. we project our sales in china will grow three to five percent in 2024 in local currency compared to 2023 driven by innovative new products and resilient demand for our core products. our guidance assumes that the currency translation impact on sales will be minimal in 2024.
combining all of these factors, we expect our 2024 consolidated sales to increase between three and five percent compared to 2023. our guidance excludes the impacts from potential future acquisitions.
results of operations in this section, we discuss the results of our operations for 2023 compared with 2022. we discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under "liquidity and capital resources." for a discussion related to 2022 compared with 2021, please refer to item 7 of part ii, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, which was filed with the united states securities and exchange commission (sec) on february 14, 2023, and is available on the sec's website at www.sec.gov.

our sales in 2023 were $3,852.8 million, or 2.6 percent higher than 2022 sales of $3,753.9 million. higher sales in 2023 were driven by higher volumes of residential and commercial water heaters, which more than offset unfavorable foreign currency impacts of approximately $56 million, lower boiler sales and unfavorable pricing in our north america segment.
our gross profit margin in 2023 of 38.5 percent increased compared to 35.4 percent in 2022. the higher gross profit margin in 2023 was primarily due to lower material costs.
selling, general, and administrative (sg&a) expenses were $727.4 million in 2023, or $56.5 million higher than in 2022. the increase in sg&a expenses was primarily due to higher employee costs, which includes management incentive expenses related to higher earnings, and compensation increases. in 2022 sg&a included the recognition of an $11.5 million favorable judgment against a competitor related to its infringement of one of our patents, which reduced sg&a expenses, and was partially offset by a $4.3 million expense associated with a terminated acquisition.
restructuring and impairment expenses in 2023 were $18.8 million, of which $15.6 million related to the sale of our business in turkey which was included in our rest of world segment. of the $18.8 million restructuring and impairment expenses, $15.7 million was recorded in the rest of world segment and $3.1 million in corporate expense.
interest expense was $12.0 million in 2023, compared to $9.4 million in 2022. the increase in interest expense in 2023 was primarily due to higher debt levels and interest rates.
other (income) expense, net was income of $6.9 million in 2023 compared to expense of $425.6 million in 2022. the change in other (income) expense, net was primarily due to a reduction in pension expenses and pension settlement expense associated with the termination of our defined benefit pension plan (the plan). in 2022, we recorded a $417.3 million pension settlement expense related to the termination of the plan which represented over 95 percent of our pension plan liability. the service cost component of our pension expense is reflected in cost of products sold and sg&a expenses. all other components of our pension expense (income) are reflected in other (income) expense-net.
our effective income tax rate in 2023 was higher than our effective income tax rate in 2022 primarily due to the tax effects of the pension settlement expense associated with the termination of the plan and a change in geographic earnings mix. we estimate that our annual effective income tax rate for the full year of 2024 will be approximately 24 to 24.5 percent.
we are providing non-u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) measures (adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share (eps), total segment earnings, adjusted segment earnings, and adjusted corporate expense) that exclude the impact of restructuring and impairment expenses, pension settlement income and expenses, non-operating pension expenses, income from a legal judgment and expenses associated with a terminated acquisition. reconciliations from gaap measures to non-gaap measures are provided in the non-gaap measures section below. we believe that the measures of adjusted earnings, adjusted eps, total segment earnings, adjusted segment earnings, and adjusted corporate expense provide useful information to investors about our performance and allow management and our investors to better understand our performance between periods without regard to items that we do not consider to be a component of our core operating performance or recurring in nature.

sales in our north america segment were $2,922.9 million in 2023, or $103.8 million higher than sales of $2,819.1 million in 2022. the increased sales in 2023 compared to the prior year were primarily driven by higher residential and commercial water heater volumes, partially offset by lower volumes of boilers and unfavorable pricing.
north america segment earnings were $726.7 million in 2023, or $460.7 million higher than segment earnings of $266.0 million in 2022. segment margins were 24.9 percent and 9.4 percent in 2023 and 2022, respectively. higher segment earnings and margins in 2023 were primarily due to higher volumes of residential and commercial water heaters and lower material costs that were partially offset by higher sg&a expenses. additionally in 2022, we realized pre-tax pension settlement expense of $346.8 million.
adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin in 2023 were $726.0 million and 24.8 percent, respectively which exclude $0.7 million of pension settlement income. adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin in 2022 were $611.0 million and 21.7 percent, respectively and exclude pension settlement expense of $346.8 million, pension expense of $9.7 million and the recognition of the $11.5 million patent infringement judgment. we estimate our 2024 north america segment margin will be approximately 24.5 to 25 percent.

sales in our rest of world segment were $956.9 million in 2023, or $8.9 million lower than sales of $965.8 million in 2022. the decrease in sales in 2023 was primarily driven by the approximately $44 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by favorable volumes in china, particularly in our water treatment and kitchen products.
rest of world segment earnings in 2023 were $83.4 million compared to $96.3 million in 2022. segment margins were 8.7 percent and 10.0 percent in 2023 and 2022, respectively. lower segment earnings and segment margin in 2023 were primarily driven by restructuring and impairment expenses of $15.7 million, of which $12.5 million was associated with the sale of our business in turkey.
adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin in 2023 were $99.1 million and 10.4 percent, respectively. adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin in 2023 exclude restructuring and impairment expenses. we estimate our 2024 rest of world segment margin will be approximately 10 percent.
liquidity and capital resources our working capital was $555.0 million at december 31, 2023 compared with $699.5 million at december 31, 2022. movements in working capital consisted of lower cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities due to the paydown of our long-term debt and trade payables. in addition, as of december 31, 2023, cash balances were negatively impacted by $12.8 million due to changes in foreign currency. cash and cash equivalents used to fund our operations are primarily generated through operating activities and provided by our existing credit facilities. we believe our available cash and existing credit facilities are sufficient to cover our cash needs for the foreseeable future. we use a global cash pooling arrangement, intercompany borrowing, and some local credit lines to meet funding needs and allocate capital resources among various entities. we have historically made and anticipate future cash repatriations to the united states from certain foreign subsidiaries. in 2023, we repatriated approximately $100 million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries through dividends and approximately $200 million through our global cash pooling arrangement. we used the proceeds to pay down outstanding debt balances.

cash used in financing activities                       (684.7)                  (430.8)
cash provided by operating activities in 2023 was $670.3 million compared with $391.4 million during 2022. the increase in operating cash flows in 2023 compared with the prior year is due to increased earnings and a more favorable working capital contribution primarily related to lower inventory levels and incentive payments. our free cash flow in 2023 and 2022 was $597.7 million and $321.1 million, respectively. we expect cash provided by operating activities to be between $640 million and $690 million in 2024. we expect free cash flow to be between $525 million to $575 million in 2024. free cash flow is a non-gaap measure and is described in more detail in the non-gaap measures section below.
our capital expenditures were $72.6 million in 2023 and $70.3 million in 2022. we project our 2024 capital expenditures will be between $105 and $115 million and expect depreciation and amortization will be approximately $70 million.
in 2021, we renewed and amended our $500 million revolving credit facility, which now expires on april 1, 2026. the renewed and amended facility, with a group of nine banks, has an accordion provision that allows it to be increased up to $850 million if certain conditions (including lender approval) are satisfied. borrowing rates under the facility are determined by our leverage ratio. the facility requires us to maintain two financial covenants, a leverage ratio test and an interest coverage test, and we were in compliance with the covenants as of december 31, 2023, and expect to be in compliance for the foreseeable future. the facility backs up commercial paper and credit line borrowings. at december 31, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding under the facility and an available borrowing capacity of $500 million. we believe the combination of available borrowing capacity and operating cash flows will provide sufficient funds to finance our existing operations for the foreseeable future.
our total debt decreased by $217.2 million in 2023 primarily due to the use of operating cash flows to pay down debt. our leverage, as measured by the ratio of total debt to total capitalization, was 6.5 percent at december 31, 2023, compared with 16.5 percent at december 31, 2022.
our remaining u.s. pension plan continues to meet all funding requirements under erisa regulations. we were not required to make a contribution to our pension plan in 2023. we forecast that we will not be required to make a contribution to the plan in 2024, and we do not plan to make any voluntary contributions in 2024. for further information on our pension plans, see note 13, "pension and other post-retirement benefits" of notes to the consolidated financial statements.
in 2023, our board of directors approved adding 7,500,000 shares of common stock to our existing discretionary share repurchase authority. under our share repurchase program, we may purchase our common stock through a combination of a rule 10b5-1 automatic trading plan and discretionary purchases in accordance with applicable securities laws. the stock repurchase authorization remains effective until terminated by our board of directors, which may occur at any time, subject to the parameters of any rule 10b5-1 automatic trading plan that we may then have in effect. during 2023, we repurchased 4,377,000 shares of our stock at a total cost of $306.5 million. as of december 31, 2023, we had 3,501,462 shares remaining on the share repurchase authority. on january 26, 2024, the board of directors approved adding 2,000,000 shares of common stock to the existing discretionary share repurchase authority. including the additional shares, we have 5,202,462 shares available for repurchase as of the date of the board of directors' approval. we intend to repurchase approximately $300 million of our common stock in 2024 through a combination of 10b5-1 plans and open-market purchases.
we paid dividends of $1.22 per share in 2023 compared with $1.14 per share in 2022. we increased our dividend by seven percent in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the five-year compound annual growth rate of our dividend payment is approximately 10 percent. we have paid dividends for 84 consecutive years with annual amounts increasing each of the last 32 years.
recent accounting pronouncements refer to recent accounting pronouncements in note 1, "organization and significant accounting policies" of notes to the consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are described in note 1, "organization and significant accounting policies" of notes to the consolidated financial statements. also as disclosed in note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. requires the use of estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements.
the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with the evaluation of the impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and significant estimates used in the determination of the liability related to product warranties. various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates. the process of determining significant estimates is fact-specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience and trends, and in some cases, actuarial techniques. we monitor these significant factors and adjustments are made as facts and circumstances dictate. historically, actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in conformity with gaap, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. we perform impairment reviews for our reporting units using a fair-value method based on management's judgments and assumptions. the fair value represents the estimated amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an arms-length basis. the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including recorded goodwill. we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets become impaired. any impairment review is, by its nature, highly judgmental as estimates of future sales, earnings and cash flows are utilized to determine fair values. however, we believe that we conduct a thorough and competent annual quantitative analysis of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. based on the annual goodwill impairment test, we determined there was no impairment of our goodwill as of december 31, 2023. the fair value of each of our reporting units significantly exceeded its carrying value and a 20 percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units would not have resulted in a different conclusion. based on the annual indefinite-lived assets impairment test, we determined there was no impairment of our indefinite-lived assets as of december 31, 2023.
product warranty our products carry warranties that generally range from one to 12 years and are based on terms that are generally accepted in the market. we provide for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time of sale. the product warranty provision is estimated based on warranty loss experience using actual historical failure rates and estimated costs of product replacement. the variables used in the calculation of the provision are reviewed at least annually. at times, warranty issues may arise which are beyond the scope of our historical experience. we provide for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable. while our warranty costs have historically been within calculated estimates, it is possible that future warranty costs could differ significantly from those estimates. the allocation of the warranty liability between current and long-term is based on the expected warranty liability to be paid in the next year as determined by historical product failure rates. at december 31, 2023 and 2022, our reserve for product warranties was $188.1 million and $182.5 million, respectively.
non-gaap measures we are providing non-u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) measures (adjusted earnings, adjusted eps, total segment earnings, adjusted segment earnings, and adjusted corporate expense) that exclude the impact of restructuring and impairment expenses, pension settlement income and expenses, non-operating pension expenses, income from a legal judgment and expenses associated with a terminated acquisition. reconciliations from gaap measures to non-gaap measures are provided below.
we believe that the measures of adjusted earnings, adjusted eps, adjusted segment earnings and adjusted corporate expense provide useful information to investors about our performance and allow management and our investors to better understand our performance between periods without regard to items that we do not consider to be a component of our core operating performance or recurring in nature.

adjusted eps (non-gaap)                                     $3.90 - 4.15                        $3.81
(1) includes pre-tax restructuring and impairment expenses of $15.7 million and $3.1 million, within the rest of world segment and corporate expenses, respectively.
outlook as we begin 2024, we expect our consolidated sales to increase between three and five percent. our sales projection is driven by continued end-market demand in water heating and a rebound in boiler and water treatment volumes after 2023 corrections in end-market inventories. in our rest of the world segment, we see overall growth with stability in china as the economy continues to work through its challenges. we expect to achieve full-year earnings of between $3.90 and $4.15 per share. our guidance excludes the impacts from potential future acquisitions.
other matters environmental our operations are governed by a number of federal, foreign, state, local and environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous materials, the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of sites owned by the company or third parties. we have expended financial and managerial resources complying with such laws. expenditures related to environmental matters were not material in 2023 and we do not expect them to be material in any single year. we have reserves associated with environmental obligations at various facilities and we believe these reserves together with available insurance coverage are sufficient to cover reasonably anticipated remediation costs. although we believe that our operations are substantially in compliance with such laws and maintain procedures designed to maintain compliance, there are no assurances that substantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future. however, since the same laws govern our competitors, we should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage.
risk management we evaluate risk to our business in a number of ways, primarily through our enterprise risk management (erm) process, which we conduct enterprise-wise on a periodic basis, and seeks to identify and address significant and material risks. our erm process assesses, manages, and monitors risks consistent with the integrated risk framework in the enterprise risk management-integrated framework (2017) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso). we believe that risk-taking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our strategy. our goal is to manage risks prudently rather than avoid risks. we can mitigate risks and their impact on our company only to a limited extent.
a team of senior executives prioritizes identified risks, including decarbonization, new technologies and cyber threats among others, and assigns an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to manage risks. our board of directors provides oversight of the erm process and reviews significant identified risks. the audit committee of the board of directors also reviews significant financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage them. our other board committees also play a role in risk management, as set forth in their respective charters.
our goal is to proactively manage risks using a structured approach in conjunction with strategic planning, with the intent to preserve and enhance shareholder value. however, the risks set forth in item 1a - risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k and other risks and uncertainties could adversely affect us and cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.
market risk we are exposed to various types of market risks, primarily currency. we monitor our risks in such areas on a continuous basis and generally enter into forward contracts to minimize such exposures. we do not engage in speculation in our derivatives strategies. further discussion regarding derivative instruments is contained in note 1, "organization and significant accounting policies" of notes to consolidated financial statements.
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies. at december 31, 2023, we had net foreign currency contracts outstanding with notional values of $118.8 million. assuming a hypothetical ten percent movement in the respective currencies, the potential foreign exchange gain or loss associated with the change in exchange rates would amount to $11.9 million. however, gains and losses from our forward contracts will be offset by gains and losses in the underlying transactions being hedged.

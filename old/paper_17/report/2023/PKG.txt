overview pca is the third largest producer of containerboard products and a leading producer of uncoated freesheet paper in north america. we operate eight mills and 86 corrugated products manufacturing plants. our containerboard mills produce linerboard and corrugating medium, which are papers primarily used in the production of corrugated products. our corrugated products manufacturing plants produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging products, including conventional shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured goods, multi-color boxes and displays with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail locations, and honeycomb protective packaging. in addition, we are a large producer of packaging for meat, fresh fruit and vegetables, processed food, beverages, and other industrial and consumer products. we also manufacture and sell ufs papers, including both commodity and specialty papers, which may have custom or specialized features such as colors, coatings, high brightness, and recycled content. we are headquartered in lake forest, illinois and operate primarily in the united states.
executivesummary net sales were $7.8 billion for the year ended december 31, 2023 and $8.5 billion for 2022. we reported $765
million of net income, or $8.48 per diluted share, in 2023, compared to $1,030 million, or $11.03 per diluted share, in 2022. net income included $19 million of expense for special items in 2023, compared to $10 million of expense for special items in 2022. special items in both periods are described later in this section. excluding special items, we recorded $784 million of net income, or $8.70 per diluted share, in 2023, compared to $1,040
million, or $11.14 per diluted share, in 2022. the decrease was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our packaging segment and lower volumes in our packaging and paper segments, partially offset by higher prices and mix in our paper segment, lower operating and converting costs, and lower annual outage expense. for additional detail on special items included in reported gaap results, as well as segment income (loss) excluding special items, earnings before non-operating pension expense, interest, income taxes, and depreciation, amortization, and depletion (ebitda), and ebitda excluding special items, see "item 7. reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures to reported amounts." pca ended the year with $1,206 million of cash and marketable debt securities and, including borrowing availability under its revolving credit facility, $1,529 million in liquidity.
packaging segment income from operations was $1,074 million in 2023, compared to $1,424 million for 2022. packaging segment ebitda excluding special items was $1,556 million in 2023, compared to $1,849 million in 2022. the decrease was driven primarily by lower containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix, lower volumes, and higher freight and logistic expenses, partially offset by lower operating and converting costs and lower annual outage expense. packaging volumes were down during the first half of the year as challenging economic conditions continued in 2023, with customers reducing orders to manage their inventories. customer ordering patterns began to normalize, and volumes began to improve mid-year, and by the fourth quarter, corrugated shipments were up 6.9% in total over fourth quarter 2022. overall, our corrugated products shipments were down (4.6%) for the year.
in order to match our supply with the demand for our products, we reduced production of containerboard at our packaging mills during the first three quarters of 2023, including idling the wallula, wa mill in june. we began ramping up production in the fourth quarter to meet increasing demand and restarted the no. 3 machine at the wallula mill. for more information on our containerboard production and corrugated products shipments, refer to the table presented under the caption "production and shipments" in "part i, item 1. business" of this form 10-k.
after increasing during the first three quarters of 2022, containerboard prices published by industry publications began to decline during the fourth quarter of 2022 and continued to decline throughout 2023. we notified customers of a $70 per ton price increase for linerboard and a $100 per ton price increase for medium effective january 1,
2024.
20
over the past several years, we made extensive capital investments throughout the packaging segment to improve productivity and efficiencies at our containerboard mills and corrugated products facilities and believe that our success in execution of these capital investments has helped us to mitigate cost inflation and better serve our customers.
paper segment income from operations was $119 million in 2023, compared to $103 million in 2022. paper segment ebitda excluding special items was $151 million in 2023, compared to $132 million in 2022. the increase was due primarily to higher paper prices and mix and lower freight and logistic expenses, partially offset by lower volumes and higher operating costs. lower volumes were driven by declining uncoated freesheet demand and sales of remaining paper at the jackson, al mill in 2022.
we have undertaken activities to convert the jackson mill from production of paper products, which the mill historically produced, to production of containerboard. for more information, see the packaging caption in "part i, item 1. business" and note 1, nature of operations and basis of presentation, of the notes to consolidated financial statements in "part ii, item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this form 10-k.

special items for 2023, includes $14.4 million of charges related to the closure of corrugated products facilities and design centers, partially offset by a gain on sale of a corrugated products facility. for 2022, includes $0.7 million of charges consisting of closure costs related to corrugated products facilities. these costs were partially offset by insurance proceeds received for a natural disaster at one of the corrugated products facilities, a gain on sale of assets related to a corrugated products facility, and a favorable lease buyout for a closed corrugated products facility.
for 2023 and 2022, includes $11.1 million and $14.1 million, respectively, of charges related to the announced discontinuation of production of uncoated freesheet paper grades on the no. 3 machine at the jackson, alabama mill associated with the permanent conversion of the machine to produce linerboard and other paper-to-containerboard conversion related activities.
includes $1.0 million of income from a favorable inventory adjustment related to the december 2021 advance packaging corporation acquisition, partially offset by acquisition and integration related costs.
amount may not foot due to rounding.
management excludes special items, as it believes these items are not necessarily reflective of the ongoing results of operations of our business. we present these measures because they provide a means to evaluate the performance of our segments and our company on an ongoing basis using the same measures that are used by our management, because these measures assist in providing a meaningful comparison between periods presented and because these measures are frequently used by investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies and the performance of their segments. a reconciliation of diluted earnings per share to diluted earnings per share excluding special items is included above and the reconciliations of other non-gaap measures used in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, to the most comparable measure reported in accordance with gaap, are included later in item 7 under "reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures to reported amounts." any analysis of non-gaap financial measures should be done in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap. the non-gaap measures are not intended to be substitutes for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such.

industry and business conditions trade publications reported north american industry-wide corrugated products shipments were down (5.0%) during
2023, compared to 2022. reported industry containerboard production decreased (3.1%) compared to 2022, and reported industry containerboard inventories at the end of 2023 were approximately 2.6 million tons, down (3.1%) compared to
2022. reported containerboard export shipments increased 2.6% compared to 2022. for linerboard, index prices decreased $10 per ton in january 2023, followed by additional decreases of $20 per ton in february 2023, $20 per ton in may 2023, and $20 per ton in november 2023, a total decrease of $70 per ton during 2023. for corrugating medium, index prices decreased $30 per ton in january 2023, followed by additional decreases of $20 per ton in february 2023, $40 per ton in may 2023, and $20 per ton in november 2023, a total decrease of $110 per ton during
2023.
the market for communication papers competes heavily with electronic data transmission and document storage alternatives. increasing shifts to these alternatives have reduced usage of traditional print media and communication papers. trade publications reported north american uncoated freesheet paper shipments decreased
(9.7%) in 2023, compared to 2022. although average prices reported by a trade publication for cut size office papers were higher by $57 per ton, or 4%, in 2023 compared to 2022, index prices declined throughout the year. for cut size office papers, index prices decreased $20 per ton in april 2023, followed by additional decreases of $10
per ton in june 2023 and $20 per ton in october 2023, a total decrease of $50 per ton during 2023. for offset printing papers, index prices decreased $30 per ton in april 2023, followed by additional decreases of $10 per ton in june 2023, $20 per ton in august 2023, $10 per ton in september 2023, and $15 per ton in november 2023, a total decrease of $85 per ton during 2023.
outlook for the first quarter of 2024, compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, in our packaging segment, we expect higher total corrugated products shipments from continued strong demand along with two additional shipping days in the first quarter. containerboard volume is expected to be lower due to a prolonged outage at the jackson mill for the conversion of the no. 3 machine and a scheduled maintenance outage at our counce, tn mill. we have restarted the no. 2 machine at the wallula mill, which will partially offset the effect of these outages. prices and mix should be slightly higher as we implement our january price increases, which will be partially offset by a decrease in the published prices that occurred late in 2023. we expect export containerboard prices to be flat. in our paper segment, we expect an improved mix to move prices slightly higher with flat sales volume. recycled fiber and energy prices will be higher, and seasonally colder weather will negatively impact usages and yields for energy, wood and chemicals along with higher operating costs associated with the restart of full operations at the wallula mill compared to fourth quarter operations. labor and benefits costs will have seasonal timing-related increases that occur at the beginning of a new year related to annual wage and benefit increases, the restart of payroll taxes, and share-based compensation expenses. scheduled outage expenses will be higher and will include the significant first quarter impact of the conversion outage at our jackson mill. considering these items, we expect first quarter earnings to be lower than the fourth quarter of 2023.

income from operations income from operations decreased $346 million, or (24.3%), for the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to 2022.
income from operations in 2023 included $25 million of expense for special items compared to $14 million in 2022.
special items in 2023 included $14 million of expense related to corrugated facility closure and other costs and
$11 million for jackson mill conversion-related activities. special items in 2022 consisted of $14 million of expense for jackson mill conversion-related activities, $1 million of corrugated facility closure and other costs, and $1 million of income related to acquisition and integration-related activities.
packaging.segment income from operations decreased $349 million to $1,074 million, compared to $1,424 million in
2022. the decrease in 2023 related primarily to lower containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix ($373
million), lower sales and production volumes ($123 million), higher depreciation expense ($47 million), and higher freight expense ($14 million), partially offset by lower operating and converting costs ($163 million), lower annual outage expense ($36 million), and other costs ($18 million). special items in 2023 included $14 million of expense for corrugated facility closure and other costs. special items in 2022 included $5 million of expense for jackson mill conversion-related activities, corrugated facility closure and other costs, and income related to acquisition and integration-related activities.
paper.segment income from operations increased $16 million to $119 million, compared to $103 million in 2022. the increase, excluding special items, primarily related to higher paper prices and mix ($40 million), lower freight expense ($14 million), and lower other costs ($2 million), partially offset by lower sales and production volumes
($23 million), higher operating costs ($13 million), and higher annual outage expense ($1 million). special items in 2023 included $11 million of expense for jackson mill conversion-related activities. special items in 2022
included $9 million of expense for jackson mill conversion-related activities.
non-operating pension expense, interest expense, net and income taxes during 2023, non-operating pension expense increased $22 million compared to 2022.the increase in non-operating pension expense was related to unfavorable 2022 asset performance, partially offset by favorable assumption changes.
interest expense, net, during 2023 decreased $17 million compared to 2022. the decrease in interest expense, net in
2023 was primarily due to higher interest income due to higher rates on invested cash balances compared to 2022.
during 2023, we recorded $249 million of income tax expense, compared to $335 million of income tax expense during
2022. the effective tax rate for both 2023 and 2022 was 24.5%.
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash our primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. we ended the year with $648 millionof cash and cash equivalents, $558 million of marketable debt securities, and $323 million of unused borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility, net of letters of credit. on november 30, 2023, we issued $400 million of 5.70% senior notes due 2033 through a registered public offering and invested the net proceeds received from this issuance in time deposits, which are included in marketable debt securities. we intend to use the net proceeds from this issuance, together with a portion of cash on hand, to redeem, repurchase, or otherwise repay at or prior to maturity our outstanding 3.65%
senior notes due 2024, which mature on september 15, 2024. see note 10, debt, of the consolidated financial statements included in "part ii, item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this form 10-k as well as information provided below under "-investing activities" and "-financing activities" for further information.

currently, our primary uses of cash are for operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service, common stock dividends, and repurchases of common stock. we believe that net cash generated from operating activities, cash on hand, available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital requirements, including payments of any declared common stock dividends, for the foreseeable future. as our debt or credit facilities become due, we will need to repay, extend or replace such facilities. our ability to do so will be subject to future economic conditions and financial, business, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
below is a summary table of our cash flows, followed by a discussion of our sources and uses of cash through operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities (dollars in millions):

equivalents operating activities our operating cash flow is primarily driven by our earnings and changes in operating assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, as well as other factors described below. cash requirements for operating activities are subject to pca's operating needs and the timing of collection of receivables and payments of payables and expenses.
during 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,315 million, compared to $1,495 million for 2022, a decrease of $180 million. cash from operations excluding changes in cash used for operating assets and liabilities decreased $258 million, primarily due to lower income from operations in 2023 as discussed above.cash increased by
$78 million due to changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily due to the following:
a net favorable change in income taxes due to lower tax payments during 2023 compared to 2022;
a net favorable change in inventories in 2023 compared to 2022 due to a smaller increase in packaging segment inventory levels in 2023, primarily in raw materials and finished goods, partially offset by an increase in paper segment inventory levels due to softening demand during 2023; and a net favorable change in accounts payable in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily related to higher production volumes during the last quarter of 2023 compared to 2022.
these favorable changes were partially offset by:
a net unfavorable change in accounts receivable levels in 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher sales and production volumes in the packaging segment during the latter portion of 2023, partially offset by lower pricing in the packaging segment in 2023; and a net unfavorable change in accrued liabilities in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily related to lower accruals for employee compensation and benefit liabilities and a decrease in customer rebates related to the timing of payments and lower sales volumes in 2023.
investing activities we used $875 million for investing activities in 2023, compared to $834 million in 2022. in 2023, we spent $470
millionfor internal capital investments, compared to $824 million in 2022. additionally, in november 2023, we invested the net proceeds received from the issuance of our $400 million of 5.70% senior notes due 2033 in time deposits, which are included in marketable debt securities.

we expect capital investments in 2024 to be between $470 million and $490 million.these expenditures could increase or decrease as a result of a number of factors, including our financial results, strategic opportunities, future economic conditions, and our regulatory compliance requirements. we currently estimate capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations will be about $15 million in 2024. our estimated environmental expenditures could vary significantly depending upon the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations. for additional information, see "environmental matters" in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
financing activities in 2023, net cash used for financing activities was $112 million, compared to $960 million of cash used for financing activities in 2022, a decrease of $848 million. we paid $449 million in dividends on our common stock in
2023, compared to $420 million paid in 2022. we repurchased and retired 0.3million shares of the company's common stock for $42 million in 2023, compared to repurchases of 4.0 million shares for $523 million in 2022.
in november 2023, we issued $400 million of 5.70% senior notes due 2033 through a registered public offering. the company paid $4 million of debt issuance costs associated with the new notes, of which $3 million was funded using the net proceeds received from the issuance of new notes and $1 million was funded using cash on hand. the net proceeds received from the issuance of the new notes were invested in time deposits. we intend to use the net proceeds from this issuance, together with a portion of cash on hand, to redeem, repurchase, or otherwise repay at or prior to maturity our outstanding 3.65% senior notes due 2024, which mature on september 15, 2024.

off-balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2023.
inflation and other general cost increases we are subject to both contractual, inflation, and other general cost increases. if we are unable to offset these cost increases by price increases, growth, and/or cost reductions in our operations, these inflation and other general cost increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows, profitability, and liquidity.
in 2023, our total company costs including cost of sales (cos) and selling, general, and administrative expenses
(sg&a) was $6.7 billion, and excluding non-cash costs (depreciation, depletion and amortization, pension and postretirement expense, and share-based compensation expense) was $6.1 billion. a 1% increase in cos and sg&a costs would increase costs by $67 million and cash costs by $61 million.
certain items of product input costs have historically been subject to more cost volatility including fiber, purchased energy, and chemicals.
energy our mills represent about 90% of our total purchased fuel costs. in 2023, our packaging and paper mills consumed about 93 million mmbtus of fuel, including internally generated and externally purchased, to produce both steam and electricity. the following table for 2023 provides the total mmbtus purchased externally by fuel type each quarter and the average cost per mmbtu by fuel type for the year. the cost per mmbtu includes the cost of the fuel plus our transportation and delivery costs.

regulatory and environmental matters our operations are subject to our compliance with the laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, primarily in the united states. of particular importance are laws and regulations relating to the environment and health and safety matters.
environmental compliance requirements are a significant factor affecting our business. we employ processes in the manufacture of containerboard, paper, and pulp, which result in various discharges, emissions and waste disposal.
these processes are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. we operate and expect to continue to operate, under environmental permits and similar authorizations from various governmental authorities that regulate such discharges, emissions, and waste disposal. the most significant of these laws affecting the company are:
resource conservation and recovery act (rcra);
clean water act (cwa);
clean air act (caa);
the emergency planning and community right-to-know-act (epcra);
toxic substance control act (tsca); and safe drinking water act (sdwa).
we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations. because environmental regulations are constantly evolving, the company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws. the company works diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations and does not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect its business or financial condition. for both the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, we spent $50 million, and in 2021, we spent $44 million, to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws. additionally, we had $14 million of environmental capital expenditures in 2023, $11 million in 2022, and $10 million in 2021.
in january 2013, the u.s. environmental protection agency (the "epa") established a three-year deadline for compliance with the boiler mact regulations, establishing air emissions standards and certain other requirements for industrial boilers. pca's compliance actions involved modifying or replacing certain boilers, and all pca mills are in full compliance with boiler mact requirements. on july 29, 2016, the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit issued a ruling on the consolidated cases challenging boiler mact. the court vacated key portions of the rule, including emission limits for certain subcategories of solid fuel boilers, and remanded issues to the epa for further rulemaking. at this time, we cannot predict with certainty how this decision will impact our existing boiler mact compliance efforts or whether we will incur additional costs to comply with any revised standards.
as is the case with any industrial operation, pca has, in the past, incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination, as required by the federal comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act, commonly known as the federal "superfund" law, and analogous state laws. cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties the company currently owns or operates, former facilities and off-site facilities where the company has disposed of hazardous substances. as part of the sale to pca of the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation in april 1999, pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with pre-closing off-site waste disposal. pactiv also retained environmentally impaired real property in filer city, michigan unrelated to current mill operations. in addition, officemax (now an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of odp) retains responsibility for certain environmental liabilities related to some of the businesses, facilities, and assets we acquired from boise. generally, this responsibility relates to hazardous substance releases and other environmental incidents that arose before 2004.
some of these liabilities could be significant; however, odp may not have sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnification obligations, and in some cases, we may not be entitled to such indemnification.
because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict, meaning that liability is imposed without fault, joint and several, meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution, and retroactive, pca could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material. from 2006 through 2023, there were no significant environmental remediation costs at pca's mills and corrugated plants. as of december 31, 2023, we maintained an environmental reserve of $25.8 million relating to on-
site landfills and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects. the company believes that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenses above the $25.8 million accrued at december
31, 2023, will have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

while legislation regarding the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions has been proposed at the federal level, it is uncertain whether such legislation will be passed and, if so, what the breadth and scope of such legislation will be. the result of the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could be an increase in our future environmental compliance costs through carbon cap and trade systems, carbon or other related taxes, or additional capital expenditures to modify facilities to reduce carbon emissions, which may be material. however, climate change legislation and the resulting future energy policy could also provide us with opportunities if the use of renewable energy is encouraged. we currently self-generate the majority of our power requirements at our mills using renewable biogenic fuel such as bark, black liquor and biomass, which are derived from renewable and sustainable resources. while we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of any renewable energy incentives, it is uncertain what the ultimate costs and opportunities of any climate change legislation will be and how our business and industry will be affected.
we are seeking to further improve our environmental impact and have voluntarily set goals to reduce our absolute scope 1 and 2 (market-based) greenhouse gas emissions by 35% by 2030 from a 2021 baseline year and to reach net-
zero carbon emissions within our own operations and our value chain by 2050. in addition, we and our industry support the american forest & paper association's goal of a 50% reduction in scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 2030 from a 2005 baseline. we have a carbon neutrality team, consisting of a cross-
functional group of key operational, engineering, environmental, and sustainability personnel to lead our efforts.
our strategy to achieve greenhouse gas emissions reductions is premised upon the carbon neutrality of the biogenic fuels used in our operations and we believe that meaningful reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved through investment in more efficient operations utilizing carbon-neutral fuels and in emerging and advancing technologies. we regularly work to identify and implement projects that will improve our efficiency. to what extent and when we embark upon major capital projects to reduce emissions will depend in part upon technology advancements, emerging regulatory and tax policies involving greenhouse gas emissions and incentives to invest in projects that reduce emissions. we also regularly assess the use of alternative, non-emitting energy sources at our own facilities (such as solar) and opportunities to support additive carbon-free grid power via renewable energy certificates (recs) and power purchase agreements (ppas), where feasible to do so, and partnering with utilities to procure carbon-free power where opportunities exist. we annually report key data to our stakeholders regarding our greenhouse gas emissions, among other things, in our responsibility report. our responsibility report is available on our website and is not intended to be incorporated by reference herein.
we are also subject to extensive federal, state and local laws related to workplace health and safety, and our safety management system includes measures to assure compliance with these laws and regulations. we do not believe that future compliance with health and safety laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, pca evaluates its estimates, including those related to business combinations, goodwill and intangible assets, pensions and other postretirement benefits, environmental liabilities, income taxes, and long-lived asset impairment, among others. pca bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
critical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results. these estimates require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. we review the development, selection, and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. the company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity:
pensions the company accounts for defined benefit pension plans in accordance with accounting standards codification ("asc")
715,compensation - retirement benefits. the calculation of pension expense and pension liabilities requires decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect expense and liability amounts, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, expected rate of compensation increases, longevity and service lives of participants, expected contributions, and other factors. the pension assumptions used to measure pension expense and liabilities are discussed in note 12, employee benefit plans and other postretirement benefits, of the notes to consolidated financial statements in "part ii, item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this form 10-k.
29
we recognize the funded status of our pension plans on our consolidated balance sheet and recognize the actuarial and experienced gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits as a component of "accumulated other comprehensive loss" in our consolidated statement of changes in stockholders' equity. actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense in future periods. at december 31, 2023, we had $70.7 million of actuarial losses and prior service costs, net of tax, recorded in "accumulated other comprehensive loss" on our consolidated balance sheet. accumulated losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of assets will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active employees in the pca plans (which is between six and nine years) and over the average remaining lifetime of inactive participants of the boise plan (which is approximately 23 years), to the extent that losses are not offset by gains in subsequent years. while we believe that the assumptions used to measure our pension obligations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and future expense.
we believe that the accounting estimate related to pensions is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period. as discussed above, the future effects of pension plans on our financial position and results of operations will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, retirement rates, investment performance, and funding decisions, among other factors. the following table presents selected assumptions used and expected to be used in the measurement of pension expense in the following periods (dollars in millions):

reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures to reported amounts net income excluding special items, ebitda, and ebitda excluding special items are non-gaap financial measures.
management excludes special items, as it believes that these items are not necessarily reflective of the ongoing operations of our business. these measures are presented because they provide a means to evaluate the performance of our segments and our company on an ongoing basis using the same measures that are used by our management, because these measures assist in providing a meaningful comparison between periods and because these measures are frequently used by investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies and the performance of their segments. any analysis of non-gaap financial measures should be done in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap. the non-gaap measures are not intended to be substitutes for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such. reconciliations of the non-gaap measures to the most comparable measure reported in accordance with gaap for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 follow (dollars in millions):

report of independent registered public accounting firm to the stockholders and board of directors packaging corporation of america:
opinions on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of packaging corporation of america and subsidiaries
(the company) as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended december 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). we also have audited the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2023, based on criteria established ininternal control - integrated framework (2013)issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended december 31, 2023, in conformity with u.s.
generally accepted accounting principles. also in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2023 based on criteria established ininternal control - integrated framework (2013)issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.
basis for opinions the company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting.
our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob) and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

critical audit matter the critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)
relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
evaluation of the value of the pension benefit obligation as discussed in notes 2 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the company's estimated pension benefit obligation totaled $1,202 million as of december 31, 2023. the pension benefit obligation is measured at the actuarial present value as of a date of all benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered before that date. the determination of the company's pension benefit obligation is dependent, in part, on the selection of certain actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate.
we identified the evaluation of the value of the pension benefit obligation as a critical audit matter because of the specialized skills required to evaluate the measurement of the pension benefit obligation. in particular, the measurement of the pension benefit obligation is sensitive to minor changes in the discount rate assumption.
the following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the company's pension benefit obligation valuation process, including a control related to the development of the discount rate. we involved an actuarial professional with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in understanding and assessing the actuarial methods and assumptions used to measure the pension benefit obligation. in addition, the actuarial professional assisted with our evaluation of the discount rate by assessing:
changes in the discount rate from the prior year against changes in published indices;
the pattern of cash flows, including consideration of the plan type and plan provisions; and the selected yield curve and its consistency with the prior year and spot rates.

1. nature of operations and basis of presentation packaging corporation of america ("we," "us," "our," "pca," or the "company") was incorporated on january 25, 1999 . in april 1999, pca acquired the containerboard and corrugated packaging products business of pactiv corporation (pactiv), formerly known as tenneco packaging, inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of tenneco inc. we are a large, diverse manufacturer of both packaging and paper products. we are headquartered in lake forest, illinois and we operate primarily in the united states. we have approximately 14,900
employees. we report our business in three reportable segments: packaging, paper, and corporate and other. our packaging segment produces a wide variety of containerboard and corrugated packaging products. the paper segment manufactures and sells a range of communication-based papers. before october 2020, our jackson, alabama mill had historically operated as a ufs paper mill, with its results of operations reported in our paper segment. beginning in october 2020, operating results for the jackson mill are included in both the packaging and paper segments.
during the fourth quarter of 2020, in order to meet strong packaging demand and maintain appropriate inventory levels, we temporarily began producing linerboard on the no. 3 machine at our jackson, alabama mill. in the first quarter of 2021, we announced the discontinuation of production of ufs paper grades on the machine and the permanent conversion of the machine to produce linerboard and other paper-to-containerboard conversion related activities. in the third quarter of 2021, we began producing corrugating medium on the no. 1 machine at the jackson mill (which had produced ufs paper in the past) to help satisfy our demand for containerboard, build necessary inventories, and evaluate the capability of the machine to produce containerboard on a cost-effective basis. the production of corrugating medium on the no.1 machine has continued to date, and consequently, the operating results for the jackson mill are included in the packaging segment for the periods presented. corporate and other includes support staff services and related assets and liabilities, transportation assets, and activity related to other ancillary support operations. for more information about our segments, see note 18, segment information. in these consolidated financial statements, certain amounts in prior periods' consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation. the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of pca and its majority-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions.
2. summary of significant accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events.
these estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. these estimates and assumptions are based on management's best estimates and judgment. management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment. we adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
changes in these estimates will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.
revenue recognition in accordance with accounting standards update ("asu") 2014-09 (topic 606): revenue from contracts with customers , we recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. the timing of revenue recognition for most goods and services occurs when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. this occurs with the transfer of control of our products at a specific point in time. for most packaging and paper products, revenue is recognized when the product is shipped from the mill or from our manufacturing facility to our customer. shipping and handling fees billed to a customer are recorded on a gross basis in "net sales," with the corresponding shipping and handling costs included in "cost of sales" in the concurrent period as the revenue is recorded. we present taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis in our consolidated statements of income. see note 4, revenue, for more information.

planned major maintenance costs the company accounts for its planned major maintenance activities in accordance with asc 360, property, plant, and equipment , using the deferral method. all maintenance costs incurred during the year are expensed in the year in which the maintenance activity occurs.
share-based compensation we recognize compensation expense for awards granted under the pca long-term equity incentive plans based on the fair value on the grant date. we recognize the cost of the equity awards expected to vest over the period the awards vest. see note 14, share-based compensation, for more information.
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market. cash and cash equivalents totaled $ 648.0 million and $ 320.0 million at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which included cash equivalents of $ 589.1 million and $ 228.4 million, respectively. at december 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $ 2.1 million and $ 1.5 million, respectively, of cash at our operations outside the united states.
marketable debt securities a majority of the company's marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale (afs) marketable debt securities in accordance with asu 2016-13, financial instruments - credit losses (topic 326). the company also has time deposits classified and accounted for as held-
to-maturity (htm) investments, as we have the intent and ability to hold these investments to maturity. the company reports its afs marketable debt securities at fair value and held-to-maturity investments at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. our marketable debt securities are classified as short-term or long-term based on each security's underlying contractual maturity date. the company's afs marketable debt securities are analyzed at the individual debt security level. changes in the fair value of the debt security have the potential to impact accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (aoci), the company's earnings, or both. the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any debt security is impaired. a decline in the fair value of the debt security below its amortized cost results in an impairment of the debt security. if there is an intent to sell the debt security, or if it is more likely than not that the debt security will be sold prior to recovering the amortized cost basis, the company recognizes the impairment as a realized loss in earnings by writing down the debt security's amortized cost basis. additional analysis is required if there is not an intent to sell the debt security, or if a recovery of the amortized cost basis is expected to be made prior to the sale of the security. if any portion of the impairment is the result of a credit loss, the company recognizes this portion in earnings through an allowance for credit losses, with the remainder recognized as unrealized loss in aoci. subsequent improvements in credit losses are recognized as a reduction in the allowance. any impairment not attributed to credit loss is recognized as an unrealized loss in aoci in its entirety. the company considers several factors when determining if a portion of an impairment is the result of a credit loss including, but not limited to, adverse conditions related to the financial health and future outlook of the issuer; the credit quality of the issuer, as reported by credit rating agencies; trends present in the issuer's industry in which it operates; and general market conditions. for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, we do no t consider any of the impairments related to our marketable debt securities to be the result of credit losses. see note 11, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities, for more information.
trade accounts receivable, allowances, and customer deductions trade accounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost and represent a contractual right to receive payment from a customer. the company's trade accounts receivable are short-term receivables, with most requiring payment within 30 to 60 days, and represent the primary class of financing receivables utilized by the company. 41 the company has entered into a number of customer-based supply chain financing programs to accelerate the receipt of payments for outstanding accounts receivable from certain customers. receivables transferred under these programs meet the requirements to be accounted for as sales in accordance with guidance under financial accounting standards board ("fasb") asc 860, transfers and servicing. the receivables are sold without recourse and are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets at the time of sale. the corresponding proceeds are reflected in cash flows from operating activities within the consolidated statements of cash flows. receivables involved with these programs constituted about 2 % and 5 % of our 2023 and 2022 net sales, respectively. in accordance with asu 2016-13, financial instruments - credit losses (topic 326), the company established an allowance for credit losses, which is a valuation account that estimates the expected credit loss over the lifetime of the asset and is deducted from, or added to, the amortized cost basis of the trade accounts receivable. the allowance for credit losses is based upon a combination of factors such as historical collection experience, aged receivables, current economic conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on future economic conditions. expected recoveries of amounts previously written off, not to exceed the aggregate of the amount previously written off, are also considered when determining the necessary allowance at the balance sheet date. when determining the allowance for credit losses, management also considers specific customer accounts that may be considered higher risk or uncollectible due to customer industry trends, bankruptcy filings, or substantial downgrades of credit scores. current period estimates for the allowance for credit losses are compared against the allowance previously recorded, and all required adjustments are reported as credit loss expense (for expected losses or write offs) or a reversal of credit loss expense (for expected recoveries) in net income. outstanding trade accounts receivable balances are written off when deemed uncollectible after undergoing reasonable collection efforts. at december 31, 2023 and 2022, the allowance for credit losses was $ 3.9 million and $ 10.0 million, respectively. the customer deductions reserve represents the estimated amount required for customer returns, allowances, and earned discounts. based on the company's experience, customer returns, allowances, and earned discounts have averaged approximately 1 % of gross selling price. accordingly, pca reserves 1 % of its open customer accounts receivable balance for these items. the reserves for customer deductions of $ 9.2 million and $ 9.6 million at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are also included as a reduction of the accounts receivable balance.
derivative instruments and hedging activities pca is exposed to the impact of commodity price changes, interest rate changes, and changes in the market value of its financial instruments. to manage these risks, we may, from time to time, enter into transactions, including certain physical commodity transactions, that are determined to be derivatives. we do not enter into derivative arrangements for trading or speculative purposes. the company records its derivatives, if any, in accordance with asc 815, derivatives and hedging . the guidance requires the company to recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value. the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use and designation of the derivative instrument. for a derivative designated as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized in earnings in the period of change at fair value together with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item. for a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss is initially reported as a component of aoci and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized in earnings. for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, pca has entered into master supply contracts, or physical commodity contracts, with suppliers and distributors of natural gas for several of its manufacturing locations. these physical commodity contracts meet the criteria of derivatives under asc 815 but qualify for the normal purchase normal sales ("npns")
scope exception, which we have elected. as such, pca is not required to apply derivative accounting treatment as required in asc 815 to these physical commodity transactions.
42
fair value measurements pca measures the fair value of its financial instruments and marketable debt securities in accordance with asc 820, fair value measurements and disclosures . the guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. it is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. as a basis for considering such assumptions, asc 820 establishes the following hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value: level 1 - valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. level 2 - valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. level 3 - valuations based on unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. assets that are measured at fair value using the net asset value (nav) per share as a practical expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy. financial instruments and marketable debt securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include the fair values of our afs marketable debt securities and our pension and postretirement benefit assets and liabilities. the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the company's marketable debt securities and pension and postretirement benefit assets and liabilities, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. see note 11, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities, and note 12, employee benefit plans and other postretirement benefits, for more information. other assets and liabilities measured and recognized at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include assets acquired and liabilities assumed and our asset retirement obligations. given the nature of these assets and liabilities, evaluating their fair value from the perspective of a market participant is inherently complex. assumptions and estimates about future values can be affected by a variety of internal and external factors. changes in these factors may require us to revise our estimates and could require us to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we recorded for the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations. these adjustments could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. see note 13, asset retirement obligations, for more information.
inventory valuation we value our raw materials, work in process, and finished goods inventories using lower of cost, as determined by the average cost method, or net realizable value. supplies and materials are valued at the first-in, first-out
(fifo) or average cost methods.
the components of inventories were as follows (dollars in millions):

inventories               $       1,013.1    $  977.3
property, plant, and equipment property, plant, and equipment are recorded at cost. cost includes expenditures for major improvements and replacements and the amount of interest cost associated with significant capital additions. repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.when property and equipment are retired, sold, or otherwise disposed of, the asset's carrying amount and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in "other expense, net" in our consolidated statements of income.

property, plant and equipment, net        $       3,863.8       $   3,900.0
the amount of interest capitalized from construction in progress was $8.1million, $7.3million, and $3.8million for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. at december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, purchases of property, plant, and equipment included in accounts payable were $24.2million and $43.7million, respectively.
depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. assets under finance leases are depreciated on the straight-line method over the term of the lease or the useful life, if shorter. the following lives are used for the various categories of assets:
buildings and land improvements    5 to 40 years machinery and equipment            3 to 25 years trucks and automobiles             3 to 10 years furniture and fixtures             3 to 20 years computers and hardware             3 to 10 years period of the leasehold improvements             lease or useful life, if shorter the amount of depreciation expense was $475.3million, $413.7million, and $376.0million for the years ended december
31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. in 2023, 2022, and 2021, we recognized incremental depreciation expense of
$14.4million, $5.7million, and $4.7million, respectively, primarily related to jackson mill conversion-related activities and closures of corrugated products facilities.
pursuant to the terms of an industrial revenue bond, title to certain property, plant, and equipment was transferred to a municipal development authority in 2009 in order to receive a property tax abatement. the title of these assets will revert back to pca upon retirement or cancellation of the bond. the assets are included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption "property, plant, and equipment, net," as all risks and rewards remain with the company.
leases we determine if an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at the inception date based on the presence of identified assets and our right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefit from or to direct the use of such assets. when we determine a lease exists, we record a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability on our consolidated balance sheets. right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. right-of-use assets are recognized at commencement date at the value of the lease liability and are adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received, and initial direct costs incurred. lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. as the discount rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.
operating lease balances are included in operating lease right-of-use assets with the related liabilities included in current operating lease obligations and long-term operating lease obligations. assets under finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, net, with the related liabilities included in current finance lease obligations and long-term finance lease obligations . we do not record lease contracts with a term of 12 months or less on our consolidated balance sheets. 44 we recognize fixed lease expense for operating leases on a straight-
line basis over the lease term. for finance leases, we recognize amortization expense on the right-of-use asset and interest expense on the lease liability over the lease term. we have lease agreements with non-lease components that relate to lease components (e.g., common area maintenance such as cleaning or landscaping, insurance, etc.).
we account for each lease and any non-lease components associated with that lease as a single lease component for all underlying asset classes. accordingly, all costs associated with a lease contract are accounted for as lease costs.
long-lived asset impairment long-lived assets other than goodwill and other intangibles are reviewed for impairment in accordance with provisions of asc 360, property, plant and equipment . in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed. if an evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset (or group of assets) is compared to the assets (or group of assets) carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair value is required.
goodwill and intangible assets the company has capitalized certain intangible assets, primarily goodwill, customer relationships, and trademarks and trade names, based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition.
amortization is provided for customer relationships on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from ten to 40
years and trademarks and trade names over periods ranging from five to 20 years . goodwill, which amounted to $
922.4 million at both december 31, 2023 and 2022, is not amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test in accordance with asc 350, intangibles - goodwill and other. we test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may exceed fair value. additionally, we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our finite-lived purchased intangible assets to determine whether any adjustments to the useful lives are necessary. the company concluded that none of the goodwill or intangible assets were impaired during the 2023, 2022, and 2021 annual impairment tests. see note 8, goodwill and intangible assets, for additional information.
pension and postretirement benefits several estimates and assumptions are required to record pension costs and liabilities, including discount rate, return on assets, and longevity and service lives of employees. we review and update these assumptions annually unless a plan curtailment or other event occurs, requiring that we update the estimates on an interim basis. while we believe the assumptions used to measure our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and future expense. see note 12, employee benefit plans and other postretirement benefits, for additional information.
for postretirement health care plan accounting, the company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumption.
environmental matters environmental expenditures that extend the life of the related property or mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination are capitalized. liabilities are recorded for environmental contingencies when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable. these liabilities are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. environmental expenditures related to existing conditions resulting from past or current operations from which no current or future benefit is discernible are expensed as incurred.
asset retirement obligations the company accounts for its retirement obligations related predominantly to landfill closure, wastewater treatment pond dredging, closed-site monitoring costs, and certain leasehold improvements under asc 410, asset retirement and environmental obligations , which requires recognition of legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets whether these assets are owned or leased. these legal obligations are recognized at fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred. when we record the liability, we capitalize the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset, which is amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset. see note 13, asset retirement obligations, for additional information.
45
deferred debt issuance costs pca has capitalized certain costs related to obtaining its financing. these costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the terms of the related financing, which range from 10 to 30 years . at december 31, 2023, deferred debt issuance costs were $ 19.9 million, of which
$ 0.3 million was recorded in "current maturities of long-term debt" and $ 19.6 million was recorded in "long-term debt" on our consolidated balance sheets. at december 31, 2022, deferred debt issuance costs were $ 17.9 million, which was recorded in "long-term debt" on our consolidated balance sheets.
cutting rights and fiber farms we lease the cutting rights to approximately 53,000 acres of timberland. for our cutting rights, we capitalize the annual lease payments and reforestation costs associated with these leases. costs are recorded as depletion when the timber or fiber is harvested and used in operations or sold to customers.
capitalized long-term lease costs for our cutting rights, primarily recorded in "other long-term assets" on our consolidated balance sheets, were $ 22.7 million and $ 22.4 million as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
the amount of depletion expense was $ 2.5 million, $ 2.4 million, and $ 2.0 million for the years ended december
31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.
deferred software costs pca capitalizes costs related to the purchase and development of software, which is used in its business operations. the costs attributable to these software systems are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on various factors such as the effects of obsolescence, technology, and other economic factors. net capitalized software costs recorded in "other long-term assets" on our consolidated balance sheets were $ 1.9
million and $ 3.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. software amortization expense was $ 1.4 million for the year ended, december 31, 2023, and $ 1.6 million for both the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021. the company accounts for costs incurred to implement a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract under asu 2018-15, intangibles - goodwill and other - internal use software (subtopic 350-40)
: customer's accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract. this asu includes guidance on capitalizing costs associated with developing or obtaining internal-use software. as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, capitalized costs associated with cloud computing arrangements were $
0.3 million and $ 1.6 million, respectively.
income taxes pca utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby it recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the financial statements. deferred tax assets will be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon management's estimates, it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in a future period. the estimates utilized in the recognition of deferred tax assets are subject to revision in future periods based on new facts or circumstances. pca's practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense .
trade agreements pca regularly trades containerboard with other manufacturers primarily to reduce shipping costs.
these agreements are entered into with other producers on an annual basis, pursuant to which both parties agree to ship an identical number of tons of containerboard to each other within the agreement period. these agreements lower transportation costs by allowing each party's containerboard mills to ship containerboard to the other party's closer corrugated products plant. pca tracks each shipment to ensure that the other party's shipments to pca match pca's shipments to the other party during the agreement period. such transfers are possible because certain grades of containerboard are commodity products with no distinguishing product characteristics. these transactions are accounted for at carrying value, and revenue is not recorded as the transactions do not represent the culmination of an earnings process. the transactions are recorded into inventory accounts, and no sale or income is recorded until such inventory is converted to a finished product and sold to an end-use customer.
46
business combinations the company accounts for acquisitions under asc 805, business combinations , asu 2021-08, business combinations (topic 805): accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers , and asu 2017-01 (topic 805): clarifying the definition of a business . asu 2021-08 requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with asc 606, revenue from contracts with customers . asu 2017-01 provides additional guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transfers of assets and activities should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses. goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated financial statements.
recently adopted accounting standards effective january 1, 2023, we adopted asu 2021-08, business combinations
(topic 805): accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers . asu 2021-08
requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with asc 606, revenue from contracts with customers . under prior business combination guidance in asc 805, business combinations , such assets and liabilities were recognized by the acquirer at fair value on the acquisition date, whereas the new guidance requires the acquirer to recognize such assets and liabilities as if it had originated the contracts. the company will apply the amended guidance on a prospective basis to any future business combinations. effective april 1, 2023, we adopted asu 2020-04, reference rate reform (topic 848): facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting . asu 2020-04
provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for, or recognizing the effects of, reference rate reform on financial reporting. the amendments in this update are elective and apply to all entities, subject to meeting certain criteria, that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference libor or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. in january 2021, the fasb issued asu 2021-01, which extends some of the optional expedients under topic 848 to include derivative contracts impacted by discounting transition. in december 2022, the fasb issued asu 2022-06, reference rate reform (topic 848): deferral of the sunset date of topic 848 , which further extends the relief offered in this series of asus through december 31, 2024. companies can apply these asus immediately. the asus can be adopted on a full retrospective basis as of any date from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to march 12, 2020, or on a prospective basis to any new modification from any date within an interim period that includes or is subsequent to the date of the issuance of a final update, up to the date that financial statements are available to be issued. the company's fixed-rate outstanding debt will not be impacted by the reference rate reform. in april 2023, we amended our senior unsecured credit agreement to formally replace the libor benchmark rate with the term sofr rate. the amendment of this agreement and the reference rate reform did not have a significant impact on the company's financial position or related disclosures.
new accounting standards not yet adopted in december 2023, the fasb issued asu 2023-09, income taxes (topic 740):
improvement to the income tax disclosures. this asu provides for more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. this asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2024 on a prospective basis. early adoption is permitted. the company is currently assessing the impact of the disclosure requirements on its consolidated financial statements. in november 2023, the fasb issued asu 2023-07, segment reporting (topic 280):
improvements to reportable segment disclosures . this asu improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. this asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2023 and interim periods starting within fiscal years beginning after december 15,
2024 on a retrospective basis. early adoption is permitted. the company is currently assessing the impact of the disclosure requirements on its consolidated financial statements.

3. leases we group our leases intotwoprimary lease types, real estate and equipment, and into various asset classes within each type. real estate leases primarily include manufacturing locations, office space, warehouses, and design centers, while equipment leases primarily include manufacturing equipment.
leases with an initial term of12months or less and certain month-to-month leases are not recorded on the balance sheet. the lease expense for these types of leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
to determine the lease term, we include the non-cancellable period of the lease together with the following: all periods covered by an option to extend the lease if we are reasonably certain to exercise that option; any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if we are reasonably certain not to exercise that option; and any periods covered by an option to extend or not to terminate the lease that are controlled by the lessor. the exercising of lease renewal options is based on whether future economic benefit is expected to be derived from the renewal. mostof our real estate leases contain at least one renewal option. renewal options generally range from1to5 years. although equipment leases may also contain renewal options, we typically do not expect to extend and/or exercise these renewal options unless a compelling business reason is provided to management.
our leases may contain fixed and variable costs. fixed costs determine the right-of-use asset. variable costs are those costs which will vary month to month and are excluded from the calculation of the right-of-use asset.
variable lease costs are recorded to lease expense in the period in which they are incurred.
our leases do not provide an implicit borrowing rate of return. therefore, we use our incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of lease payments at inception of the lease or when a lease is modified.

4. revenue revenue recognition revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. sales, value added, and other taxes collected concurrently with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.
the following table presents our revenues disaggregated by product line (dollars in millions):

packaging revenue our containerboard mills produce linerboard and corrugating medium which are papers primarily used in the production of corrugated products. the majority of our containerboard production is used internally by our corrugated products manufacturing facilities. the remaining containerboard is sold to outside domestic and export customers. our corrugated products manufacturing plants produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging products and retail merchandise displays. we sell corrugated products to national, regional and local accounts, which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic locations.
the company recognizes revenue for its packaging products when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. this occurs with the transfer of control of our products at a specific point in time. based on our express terms and conditions of the sale of products to our customers, as well as terms included in contractual arrangements with our customers, we do not have an enforceable right of payment that includes a reasonable profit throughout the duration of the contract for products that do not have an alternative use. revenue is recognized when the product is shipped from the mill or from our manufacturing facility to our customer. certain customers may receive volume-based incentives, which are accounted for as variable consideration.
we estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenue recognized.
certain customers receive a portion of their packaging products as consigned inventory with billing triggered once the customer uses or consumes the designated product. prior to invoicing, these amounts are handled as unbilled receivables. total unbilled receivables, which are immaterial in amount, are included in the accounts receivable financial statement caption.
paper revenue we manufacture and sell a range of communication-based papers. communication papers consist of cut-size office papers, and printing and converting papers.
the company recognizes revenue for its paper products when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. this occurs with the transfer of control of our products at a specific point in time. revenue is recognized when the product is shipped from the mill or from our manufacturing facility or distribution center to our customer. certain customers may receive volume-based incentives, which are accounted for as variable consideration. we estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenue recognized.
corporate and other revenue revenue in this segment primarily relates to louisiana timber procurement company, l.l.c. (ltp), a variable-
interest entity that is50% owned by pca and50% owned by boise cascade company (boise cascade). pca is the primary beneficiary of ltp and has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of ltp. therefore, we consolidate 100% of ltp in our financial statements. see note 17, transactions with related parties, for more information related to ltp.
the company recognizes revenue within this segment when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. this occurs with the transfer of control of our products at a specific point in time.

practical expedients and exemption shipping and handling fees billed to a customer are recorded on a gross basis in "net sales" with the corresponding shipping and handling costs included in "cost of sales" in the concurrent period as the revenue is recorded. we expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period is one year or less. sales commissions are recorded in "selling, general, and administrative expenses".
we do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less.

(a) deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. both the 2023 and 2022 valuation allowances relate to capital losses.
we do not expect to generate capital gains before the capital losses expire. if or when recognized, the tax benefits relating to the reversal of any or all of the valuation allowance would be recognized as a benefit to income tax expense.
cash payments for federal, state, and foreign income taxes were $212.3million, $277.4million, and $210.5million for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

at december 31, 2023, pca had recorded a $2.4million gross reserve for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties. of the total, $2.4million (net of the federal benefit for state taxes) would impact the effective tax rate if recognized.
pca recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties as income tax expense. for both years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $0.1million of interest and penalties recorded for unrecognized tax benefits. pca doesnot expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months.

amortization expense was $38.3million, $39.1million, and $37.7million for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.estimated amortization expense of intangible assets over the next five years is expected to approximate $37.7million (2024), $37.6million (2025), $37.5million(2026), $34.7million (2027) and $27.1million
(2028).
impairment testing we test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may exceed fair value. additionally, when we experience changes to our business or operating environment, we evaluate the remaining useful lives and recoverability of our finite-
lived purchased intangible assets to determine whether any adjustments to the useful lives or impairment are necessary. we completed our annual qualitative assessment in the fourth quarter, and there wasnoindication of goodwill or intangible asset impairment.

the instruments governing our indebtedness contain financial and other covenants that limit the ability of pca and its subsidiaries to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, incur liens, incur indebtedness at the subsidiary level, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. the revolving credit agreement also requires us to comply with certain financial covenants, including maintaining a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. a failure to comply with these restrictions could lead to an event of default, which could result in an acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness and/or prohibit us from drawing on the revolving credit facility. an acceleration under the revolving credit facility may also constitute an event of default under the senior notes indenture. at december 31, 2023, we were in compliance with these covenants.
at december 31, 2023, we have$2,891.7millionof fixed-rate senior notes outstanding. at december 31, 2023, the fair value of our fixed-rate debt was estimated to be$2,568.2million. the difference between the book value and fair value is due to the difference between the period-end market interest rate and the stated rate of our fixed-rate debt. we estimated the fair value of our fixed-rate debt using quoted market prices (level 2 inputs), discussed further in note 2, summary of significant accounting policies.
repayments, interest, and other in 2023 and 2022, we did not repay any outstanding debt, as we did not have any maturities of our senior notes during 2023 and 2022.
in october 2021, we used the net proceeds from the september 2021 offering of the new3.05% notes and cash on hand to redeem an old series of4.50% notes, which were scheduled to mature in 2023. we completed the redemption of the old4.50% notes for $769.8million, which included a redemption premium and accrued and unpaid interest.
as of december 31, 2023, annual principal maturities for debt, excluding unamortized debt discount, are:
$400.0million for 2024;none for 2025;none for 2026; $500.0million for 2027; and $2.0billion for 2028 and thereafter.

(a) we had $ 400.0 million of investments in time deposits classified as htm debt securities as of december 31,
2023. all these investments mature within one year and are recorded in "short-term marketable debt securities" on our consolidated balance sheets. we record htm debt securities at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. we did no t have any investments classified as htm debt securities as of december 31, 2022.
(b) valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
(c) valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, net realized gains and losses on the sales and maturities of certain marketable debt securities were insignificant.

the company invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. the company's investment policy requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. the maturities of the company's long-term marketable debt securities generally range fromonetotwo years.
fair values were determined for each individual marketable debt security in the investment portfolio. when evaluating a marketable debt security for other-than-temporary impairment, pca reviews factors such as the duration and extent to which the fair value of the marketable debt security is less than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, the general market condition in which the issuer operates, and pca's intent to sell or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the marketable debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis.
as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, we donot consider any of the impairments related to our marketable debt securities to be the result of credit losses. therefore, we havenot recorded an allowance for credit losses related to our marketable debt securities. all unrealized gains and losses were recorded in other comprehensive income
(oci).
the following table provides information about the company's marketable debt securities that have been in a continuous loss position as of december 31, 2023 and 2022 (in millions, except number of marketable debt securities in a loss position):

12. employee benefit plans and other postretirement benefits pca has defined pension benefit plans for both salaried and hourly employees. the plans covering salaried employees are closed to new entrants with only certain current active participants still accruing benefits. the plans covering certain hourly employees are closed to new participants. we also have a supplemental executive retirement plan (serp) and other nonqualified defined benefit pension plans that provide supplemental retirement benefits to certain of our current and former management employees. the serp provides for incremental pension benefits in excess of those offered in our principal pension plans.
other postretirement benefits pca provides postretirement medical and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees.

obligations and funded status of defined benefit pension andother postretirement benefits plans the funded status of pca's plans change from year to year based on the plan asset investment return, contributions, benefit payments, the discount rate used to measure the liability, and expected participant longevity.the following table, which includes only company-sponsored defined benefit and other postretirement benefit plans, reconciles the beginning and ending balances of the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. we recognize the underfunded status of these plans on the consolidated balance sheets, and we recognize changes in funded status in the year changes occur through the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (dollars in millions):

(b) accumulated losses in excess of 10 % of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of assets will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active employees in pca plans (which is between six and nine years ) and over the average remaining lifetime of inactive participants in the boise plan (which is approximately 23 years), to the extent that losses are not offset by gains in subsequent years.
at december 31, 2022, the company merged the four boise qualified pension plans into one qualified pension plan. as a result of this plan merger, we did not have any plans in an overfunded position for the year ended december 31,
2022.
for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, the accumulated benefit obligations for the plans with obligations in excess of plan assets is $42.9million and $1.1billion, respectively, the pension benefit obligations for the plans with obligations in excess of plan assets is $334.3million and $1.2billion, respectively, and the fair value of the plan assets for the plans with obligations in excess of plan assets is $267.2million and $1.1billion, respectively. additionally, for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, the accumulated benefit obligations for the opeb plans with obligations in excess of plan assets is $10.5million and $9.5million, respectively.

asset return assumption.the expected return on plan assets reflects the expected long-term rates of return for the categories of investments currently held in the plans as well as anticipated returns for additional contributions made in the future. the expected long-term rate of return is adjusted when there are fundamental changes in expected returns on the plan investments. the weighted-average expected return on plan assets we will use in our calculation of 2024 net periodic pension benefit cost is5.80%.
rate of compensation increase.the rate of compensation increase is determined by pca based upon annual reviews. the compensation increase assumption is not applicable for all plans as many of our pension plans are frozen and not accruing benefits.
health care cost trend rate assumptions.pca assumed health care cost trend rates for its postretirement benefits plans were as follows:
2023      2022      2021
health care cost trend rate assumed for                    7.13 %    7.24 %    6.55 %
next year rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline    4.44 %    4.42 %    4.50 %

investment policies and strategies pca has retained the services of professional advisors to oversee pension investments and provide recommendations regarding investment strategy. pca's overall strategy and related apportionments between equity and debt securities may change from time to time based on market conditions, external economic factors, and the funded status of the plans. the general investment objective for all of our plan assets is to optimize growth of the pension plan trust assets, while minimizing the risk of significant losses to enable the plans to satisfy their benefit payment obligations over time. the objectives take into account the long-term nature of the benefit obligations, the liquidity needs of the plans, and the expected risk/return trade-offs of the asset classes in which the plans may choose to invest.assets of our pension plans were invested in the following classes of securities at december 31,
2023 and 2022:

at december 31, 2023, the targeted investment allocations differed between the plans based on funded status. for our pension plans, the weighted average target allocation of plan assets was72% in fixed income,27% in equities, and1% in other. our retirement committee reviews the investment allocations for reasonableness at a minimum, semi-
annually.
investment securities, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and overall market volatility risk, all of which are subject to change. due to the level of risk associated with some investment securities, it is reasonably possible that changes in the values of investment securities will occur in the near term, and such changes could materially affect the reported amounts.

(a) in accordance with asc 820, fair value measurement , certain investments that do not have readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value using the net asset value (nav) per share practical expedient and are not classified within the fair value hierarchy.
funding and cash flows pca makes pension plan contributions that are sufficient to fund its actuarially determined costs, generally equal to the minimum amounts required by the employee retirement income security act (erisa). from time to time, pca may make discretionary contributions based on the funded status of the plans, tax deductibility, income from operations, and other factors. in each of 2023, 2022, and 2021, we made contributions of $50.0million to our qualified pension plans. we do not have a required minimum contribution amount established for 2024, but we expect to make discretionary contributions to our plans.
the following are estimated benefit payments to be paid to current plan participants by year (dollars in millions).
qualified pension benefit payments are paid from plan assets, while nonqualified pension benefit payments are paid by the company.

defined contribution plans some of our employees participate in defined contribution savings plans, available to most of our salaried and hourly employees. the defined contribution plans permit participants to make contributions by salary reduction pursuant to section 401(k) of the code. pca made employer-matching contributions of $45.2million, $44.3million, and
$38.2million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. all company-matching contributions to all employees were made in cash. we expense employer matching contributions and charge dividends on shares held by the esop to retained earnings. shares of company stock held by the esop are included in basic shares for earnings-per-share computations. at december 31, 2023 and 2022, the esop held1.1million and1.2million shares of company stock, respectively.
certain salaried and hourly employees that are not participating in a pca sponsored defined benefit pension plan receive a service-related company retirement contribution to their defined contribution plan account in addition to any employer matching contribution. this contribution increases with years of service and ranges from3% to5% of base pay. we contributed $45.4million, $43.7million, and $46.4million for this retirement contribution during the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

deferred compensation plans key managers can elect to participate in a deferred compensation plan. the deferred compensation plan is unfunded;
therefore, benefits are paid from our general assets. at december 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $31.0million and
$22.8million, respectively, of liabilities attributable to participation in our deferred compensation plan on our consolidated balance sheets.
13. asset retirement obligations our asset retirement obligations relate predominantly to landfill closure, wastewater treatment pond dredging, closed-site monitoring costs, and certain leasehold improvements. in accordance with asc 410,asset retirement and environmental obligations,we recognize the fair value of these liabilities as an asset retirement obligation and capitalize that cost as part of the cost basis of the related asset in the period in which the costs are incurred if sufficient information is available to reasonably estimate the fair value of the obligation. fair value estimates are determined using level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. the fair value of our asset retirement obligations is measured using expected future cash outflows discounted using the company's credit-adjusted risk-
free interest rate. over time, the liability is accreted to its settlement value, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. these liabilities are based on the best estimate of costs and are updated periodically to reflect current technology, laws and regulations, inflation, and other economic factors. occasionally, we become aware of events or circumstances that require us to revise our future estimated cash flows. when revisions become necessary, we recalculate our obligation and adjust our asset and liability accounts utilizing appropriate discount rates. no assets are legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations. upon settlement of the liability, we will recognize a gain or loss for any difference between the settlement amount and the liability recorded.

period we have additional asset retirement obligations with indeterminate settlement dates. the fair value of these asset retirement obligations cannot be estimated due to the lack of sufficient information to estimate the settlement dates of the obligations. these asset retirement obligations include, for example, (i) removal and disposal of potentially hazardous materials related to equipment and/or an operating facility if the equipment and/or facilities were to undergo major maintenance, renovation, or demolition and (ii) storage sites or owned facilities for which removal and/or disposal of chemicals and other related materials are required if the operating facility is closed. we will recognize a liability in the period in which sufficient information becomes available to reasonably estimate the fair value of these obligations.
14. share-based compensation the company has a long-term equity incentive plan, which allows for grants of restricted stock, performance awards, stock appreciation rights, and stock options to directors, officers, and employees, as well as others who engage in services for pca. on february 25, 2020, our board of directors approved, and, on may 5, 2020, our stockholders approved, the amendment and restatement of the plan. the amendment extended the plan's term tomay 5, 2030and increased the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the plan by1.4million shares. the total number of shares authorized for past and future awards is12.0million shares.
as of december 31, 2023, assuming performance units are paid out at the target level of performance,0.7million shares were available for future grants under the current plan. forfeitures are added back to the pool of shares of common stock available to be granted at a future date.

(b) the total fair value of awards upon vesting, including dividends, for the years ended december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $ 19.3 million, $ 19.7 million, and $ 11.0 million, respectively. upon vesting of the awards in 2023,
2022, and 2021, pca issued 146,631 shares, 144,193 shares, and 81,577 shares, respectively. for 2023, 2022, and

the fair value of restricted stock is determined based on the closing price of the company's stock on the grant date. compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recorded over the requisite service period. as pca's board of directors has the ability to accelerate the vesting of these awards upon an employee's retirement, the company accelerates the recognition of compensation expense for certain employees approaching normal retirement age.

for performance unit awards made in 2023, 2022, and 2021, in terms of grant date value,50% used total shareholder return (tsr) as the performance measure and50% used return on invested capital (roic) as the performance measure.
all units awarded before 2018 used roic as the performance measure. the roic component of performance unit awards is valued based on the closing price of the stock on the grant date. as the roic component contains a performance condition, compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recorded over the requisite service period based on the most probable number of awards expected to vest. the tsr component of performance unit awards is valued using a monte carlo simulation as the tsr component contains a market condition. the monte carlo simulation estimates the fair value of the tsr component based on the expected term of the award, a risk-free interest rate, expected dividends, and expected volatility of the company's common stock and the common stock of the peer companies. compensation expense is recorded ratably over the expected term of the award.
the unrecognized compensation expense for all share-based awards was as follows (dollars in millions):

compensation expense we evaluate share-based compensation expense on a quarterly basis based on our estimate of expected forfeitures, review of recent forfeiture activity, and expected future turnover. we recognize the effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate for all expense amortization in the period that we change the forfeiture estimate. the effect of forfeiture adjustments was insignificant in all periods presented.
15. stockholders' equity dividends during the year ended december 31, 2023, we paid $448.9million of dividends to shareholders. on december 6, 2023, pca's board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $1.25per share of common stock, which was paid on january 16, 2024 to shareholders of record as of december 18, 2023. the dividend payment was $112.0million.
share repurchase program on january 26, 2022, pca announced that its board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $1billion of the company's outstanding common stock. at the time of the announcement, there was no remaining authority under previously announced programs. repurchases may be made from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities regulations. the timing and amount of repurchases will be determined by the company in its discretion based on factors such as pca's stock price and market and business conditions.
during 2023, we paid $41.5million, including fees, to repurchase0.3million shares of common stock. all shares repurchased have been retired. at december 31, 2023, $436.0million of the authorized amount remained available for repurchase of the company's common stock.

16. concentrations of risk odp corporation ("odp"), formerly office depot inc., along with its subsidiaries and affiliates, is our largest customer in the paper segment. our paper segment has had a long-standing commercial and contractual relationship with odp. this relationship exposes us to a significant concentration of business and financial risk. our sales to odp represented approximately 5 % for 2023 and 4 % for 2022, and about 61 % and 48 %
of our paper segment sales revenue for those periods, respectively. at december 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $ 46.5
million and $ 52.4 million of accounts receivable due from odp, respectively, which represents approximately 4 %
and 5 % of our total company receivables for those periods, respectively. in 2023, sales to odp represented about
61 % of our paper segment sales. if these sales are reduced, we would need to find new customers. we may not be able to fully replace any lost sales, and any new sales may be at lower prices or higher costs. any significant deterioration in the financial condition of odp affecting its ability to pay or any other change that affects its willingness to purchase our products will harm our business and results of operations. labor at december 31, 2023, we had approximately 14,900 employees, and approximately 45 % of these employees worked pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. approximately 63 % of our hourly employees worked pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. the majority of our unionized employees are represented by the united steel workers (usw), the printing packaging production workers union (pppwu), the association of western pulp and paper workers (awppw), the international association of machinists (iam), and the international brotherhood of teamsters (ibt). of the employees who work pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, a pproximately 38 % work pursuant to collective bargaining agreements that will expire within the next twelve months.

17. transactions with related parties louisiana timber procurement company, l.l.c. (ltp) is a variable-interest entity that is 50 % owned by pca and 50 % owned by boise cascade company (boise cascade). ltp procures sawtimber, pulpwood, residual chips, and other residual wood fiber to meet the wood and fiber requirements of pca and boise cascade in louisiana. pca is the primary beneficiary of ltp and has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of ltp. therefore, we consolidate 100% of ltp in our financial statements in our corporate and other segment. the carrying amounts of ltp's assets and liabilities (which relate primarily to non-inventory working capital items) on our consolidated balance sheets were $ 3.3 million at december
31, 2023 and $ 2.2 million at december 31, 2022. for 2023, 2022, and 2021, we recorded $ 80.2 million, $ 85.5
million, and $ 84.4 million, respectively, of ltp sales to boise cascade in "net sales" in the consolidated statements of income and approximately the same amount of expenses in "cost of sales". fiber purchases from related parties were $ 11.5 million for 2023 and $ 13.5 million for both 2022 and 2021. most of these purchases related to chip and log purchases by ltp from boise cascade's wood products business. these purchases are recorded in "cost of sales" in the consolidated statements of income.
18. segment information we report our business inthreereportable segments: packaging, paper, and corporate and other. these segments represent distinct businesses that are managed separately because of differing products and services. each of these businesses requires distinct operating and marketing strategies.
packaging.we manufacture and sell a wide variety of containerboard and corrugated packaging products, including conventional shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured goods, multi-color boxes and displays with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail locations. in addition, we are a large producer of packaging for meat, fresh fruit and vegetables, processed food, beverages, and other industrial and consumer products.
paper.we manufacture and sell a range of communication-based papers. our papers can be manufactured as either commodity papers or specialty papers with specialized or custom features, such as colors, coatings, high brightness, or recycled content.
corporate and other.our corporate and other segment includes corporate support staff services and related assets and liabilities, and foreign exchange gains and losses. this segment also includes transportation assets, such as rail cars and trucks, which we use to transport our products from some of our manufacturing sites and assets related to ltp. see note 17, transactions with related parties, for more information related to ltp. sales in this segment relate primarily to ltp and our rail and truck business. we provide transportation services not only to our own facilities but also, on a limited basis, to third parties when geographic proximity and logistics are favorable. rail cars and trucks are generally leased.
each segments' profits and losses are measured on operating profits before interest expense, net and other and income taxes. for many of these allocated expenses, the related assets and liabilities remain in the corporate and other segment.

19. commitments, guarantees, indemnifications, and legal proceedings we have financial commitments and obligations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. these include long-term debt (discussed in note 10, debt), lease obligations (discussed in note 3, leases), purchase commitments for goods and services, and legal proceedings (discussed below).
purchase commitments in the table below, we set forth our enforceable and legally binding purchase obligations as of december 31,
2023.these obligations relate to various purchase agreements for items such as minimum amounts of energy, fiber, and chemical purchases over periods ranging fromone yearto28years.some of the amounts are based on management's estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties, and other factors. because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, our actual payments may vary from those reflected in the table.total purchase commitments with obligations greater than one year were as follows (dollars in millions):
2024          $   92.5
2025              77.9
2026              52.3
2027              30.9
2028              11.1
thereafter        71.0
total         $  335.7
the company purchased a total of $432.6million, $520.5million, and $360.8million during the years ended december
31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, under these purchase agreements.

environmental matters the potential costs for various environmental matters are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup costs, the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations, and the timing, varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies. from 2006
through 2023, there were no significant environmental remediation costs at pca's mills and corrugated plants. at december 31, 2023, the company had $25.8million of environmental-related reserves recorded on its consolidated balance sheet. of the$25.8million, approximately $18.7million related to environmental-related asset retirement obligations discussed in note 13, asset retirement obligations, and $7.1million related to our estimate of other environmental contingencies. the company recorded $4.0million in "accrued liabilities" and $21.8million in "other long-term liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheet. liabilities recorded for environmental contingencies are estimates of the probable costs based upon available information and assumptions. because of these uncertainties, pca's estimates may change. the company believes that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenditures for remediation costs and asset retirement obligations above the $25.8million accrued as of december
31, 2023 will have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
guarantees and indemnifications we provide guarantees, indemnifications, and other assurances to third parties in the normal course of our business. these include tort indemnifications, environmental assurances, and representations and warranties in commercial agreements. at december 31, 2023, we are not aware of any material liabilities arising from any guarantee, indemnification, or financial assurance we have provided. if we determined such a liability was probable and subject to reasonable determination, we would accrue for it at that time.
deridder mill incident onfebruary 8, 2017, a tank located in the pulp mill at the company's deridder, louisiana facility exploded, resulting in three contractor fatalities and other injuries. the company has been served with multiple lawsuits involving the decedents and other allegedly injured parties, alleging negligence on the part of the company and claiming compensatory and punitive damages. the company believes that these suits are covered by its liability insurance policies, subject to an aggregate $1.0million deductible. the majority of these lawsuits have been settled by the company and its insurers. the company has not incurred aggregate losses in excess of its insurance deductible in connection with these settlements, and its insurance deductible has been satisfied in full. the company is vigorously defending the remaining lawsuits, which involve nine plaintiffs and are pending in the u.s.
district court for the middle district of louisiana. these cases are scheduled for trial in april 2024. while the company cannot predict the outcome of the trial, the company believes that it is not reasonably possible that it will incur material losses in excess of its insurance deductible.
in may 2017, the epa conducted an on-site inspection of the deridder facility to assess compliance with the clean air act, risk management program ("rmp"). the company provided additional information to the epa promptly after the inspection to address certain areas of concern ("aocs") observed during the inspection. since the inspection in
2017, pca performed several voluntary activities to address the aocs presented in the epa's inspection report and has removed the rmp covered process from the facility. in january 2021, the epa and u.s. department of justice
("doj") initiated civil judicial enforcement discussions with pca. during the third quarter of 2022, we reached a settlement with the agencies, resulting in an agreed civil penalty of $2.5million. the company did not admit liability for violation of the clean air act in connection with the settlement. the settlement was approved by the federal district court for the western district of louisiana in december 2022, and the agreed civil penalty was paid out in january 2023.
legal proceedings we are also a party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business. these legal actions include commercial liability claims, premises liability claims, and employment-related claims, among others. as of the date of this filing, we believe it is not reasonably possible that any of the legal actions against us will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

item 9.changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure not applicable.
item 9a.controlsand procedures controls and procedures pca maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in rule 13a-15(e) of the securities exchange act of
1934) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in pca's filings under the securities exchange act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec and that such information is accumulated and communicated to pca's management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
prior to filing this report, pca completed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of pca's management, including pca's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of pca's disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31, 2023. the evaluation of pca's disclosure controls and procedures included a review of the controls' objectives and design, pca's implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this report. based on this evaluation, pca's chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that pca's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of december 31, 2023.
during the quarter ended december 31, 2023, there were no changes to internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, pca's internal control over financial reporting.
management's report on internal control over financial reporting pca's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a-15(f). internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the company's assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only with proper authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, pca's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that objectives of the control system are met. because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.
pca's management, under the supervision of and with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, assessed the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2023, based on criteria established ininternal control - integrated framework (2013)issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso). based on this assessment, pca's management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31, 2023 based on the specified criteria.
kpmg llp, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited pca's financial statements included in this form 10-k, has also audited the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting.
their attestation report precedes pca's audited financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this form 10-k. this discussion includes forward-looking statements regarding our expectations with respect to our future performance, liquidity, esg goals, and capital resources. such statements, along with any other non-historical statements in the discussion, are forward-looking. see our discussion regarding forward-looking statements included under "part i, item 1a. risk factors" of this form 10-k. for our discussion and analysis of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2021, the earliest of the years presented in the accompanying audited financial statements included in item 8 herein, please refer to our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022, filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 23, 2023. such information is presented in item 7 of such report under the subcaptions "results of operations -year ended december 31, 2022, compared with year ended december 31, 2021" and "liquidity and capital resources" and is incorporated by reference herein.
overview pca is the third largest producer of containerboard products and a leading producer of uncoated freesheet paper in north america. we operate eight mills and 86 corrugated products manufacturing plants. our containerboard mills produce linerboard and corrugating medium, which are papers primarily used in the production of corrugated products. our corrugated products manufacturing plants produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging products, including conventional shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured goods, multi-color boxes and displays with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail locations, and honeycomb protective packaging. in addition, we are a large producer of packaging for meat, fresh fruit and vegetables, processed food, beverages, and other industrial and consumer products. we also manufacture and sell ufs papers, including both commodity and specialty papers, which may have custom or specialized features such as colors, coatings, high brightness, and recycled content. we are headquartered in lake forest, illinois and operate primarily in the united states.
executive summary net sales were $7.8 billion for the year ended december 31, 2023 and $8.5 billion for 2022. we reported $765 million of net income, or $8.48 per diluted share, in 2023, compared to $1,030 million, or $11.03 per diluted share, in 2022. net income included $19 million of expense for special items in 2023, compared to $10 million of expense for special items in 2022. special items in both periods are described later in this section. excluding special items, we recorded $784 million of net income, or $8.70 per diluted share, in 2023, compared to $1,040 million, or $11.14 per diluted share, in 2022. the decrease was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our packaging segment and lower volumes in our packaging and paper segments, partially offset by higher prices and mix in our paper segment, lower operating and converting costs, and lower annual outage expense. for additional detail on special items included in reported gaap results, as well as segment income (loss) excluding special items, earnings before non-operating pension expense, interest, income taxes, and depreciation, amortization, and depletion (ebitda), and ebitda excluding special items, see "item 7. reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures to reported amounts." pca ended the year with $1,206 million of cash and marketable debt securities and, including borrowing availability under its revolving credit facility, $1,529 million in liquidity.
packaging segment income from operations was $1,074 million in 2023, compared to $1,424 million for 2022. packaging segment ebitda excluding special items was $1,556 million in 2023, compared to $1,849 million in 2022. the decrease was driven primarily by lower containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix, lower volumes, and higher freight and logistic expenses, partially offset by lower operating and converting costs and lower annual outage expense. packaging volumes were down during the first half of the year as challenging economic conditions continued in 2023, with customers reducing orders to manage their inventories. customer ordering patterns began to normalize, and volumes began to improve mid-year, and by the fourth quarter, corrugated shipments were up 6.9% in total over fourth quarter 2022. overall, our corrugated products shipments were down (4.6%) for the year.
in order to match our supply with the demand for our products, we reduced production of containerboard at our packaging mills during the first three quarters of 2023, including idling the wallula, wa mill in june. we began ramping up production in the fourth quarter to meet increasing demand and restarted the no. 3 machine at the wallula mill. for more information on our containerboard production and corrugated products shipments, refer to the table presented under the caption "production and shipments" in "part i, item 1. business" of this form 10-k.
after increasing during the first three quarters of 2022, containerboard prices published by industry publications began to decline during the fourth quarter of 2022 and continued to decline throughout 2023. we notified customers of a $70 per ton price increase for linerboard and a $100 per ton price increase for medium effective january 1, 2024.
over the past several years, we made extensive capital investments throughout the packaging segment to improve productivity and efficiencies at our containerboard mills and corrugated products facilities and believe that our success in execution of these capital investments has helped us to mitigate cost inflation and better serve our customers.
paper segment income from operations was $119 million in 2023, compared to $103 million in 2022. paper segment ebitda excluding special items was $151 million in 2023, compared to $132 million in 2022. the increase was due primarily to higher paper prices and mix and lower freight and logistic expenses, partially offset by lower volumes and higher operating costs. lower volumes were driven by declining uncoated freesheet demand and sales of remaining paper at the jackson, al mill in 2022.
we have undertaken activities to convert the jackson mill from production of paper products, which the mill historically produced, to production of containerboard. for more information, see the packaging caption in "part i, item 1. business" and note 1, nature of operations and basis of presentation, of the notes to consolidated financial statements in "part ii, item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this form 10-k.
special items and earnings per diluted share, excluding special items earnings per diluted share, excluding special items, in 2023 and 2022 were as follows:
year ended december 31,
2023                      2022
earnings per diluted share                                        $8.48                    $11.03
special items:
facilities closure and other costs (a)                             0.12                      0.01
jackson mill conversion-related activities (b)                     0.09                      0.11
acquisition and integration-related activities (c)                    -                     (0.01   )
total special items expense                                        0.21                      0.11
earnings per diluted share, excluding special items          $ 8.70 (d)                    $11.14
(a)for 2023, includes $14.4 million of charges related to the closure of corrugated products facilities and design centers, partially offset by a gain on sale of a corrugated products facility. for 2022, includes $0.7 million of charges consisting of closure costs related to corrugated products facilities. these costs were partially offset by insurance proceeds received for a natural disaster at one of the corrugated products facilities, a gain on sale of assets related to a corrugated products facility, and a favorable lease buyout for a closed corrugated products facility.
(b)for 2023 and 2022, includes $11.1 million and $14.1 million, respectively, of charges related to the announced discontinuation of production of uncoated freesheet paper grades on the no. 3 machine at the jackson, alabama mill associated with the permanent conversion of the machine to produce linerboard and other paper-to-containerboard conversion related activities.
(c)includes $1.0 million of income from a favorable inventory adjustment related to the december 2021 advance packaging corporation acquisition, partially offset by acquisition and integration related costs.
(d)amount may not foot due to rounding.
management excludes special items, as it believes these items are not necessarily reflective of the ongoing results of operations of our business. we present these measures because they provide a means to evaluate the performance of our segments and our company on an ongoing basis using the same measures that are used by our management, because these measures assist in providing a meaningful comparison between periods presented and because these measures are frequently used by investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies and the performance of their segments. a reconciliation of diluted earnings per share to diluted earnings per share excluding special items is included above and the reconciliations of other non-gaap measures used in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, to the most comparable measure reported in accordance with gaap, are included later in item 7 under "reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures to reported amounts." any analysis of non-gaap financial measures should be done in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap. the non-gaap measures are not intended to be substitutes for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such.
industry and business conditions trade publications reported north american industry-wide corrugated products shipments were down (5.0%) during 2023, compared to 2022. reported industry containerboard production decreased (3.1%) compared to 2022, and reported industry containerboard inventories at the end of 2023 were approximately 2.6 million tons, down (3.1%) compared to 2022. reported containerboard export shipments increased 2.6% compared to 2022. for linerboard, index prices decreased $10 per ton in january 2023, followed by additional decreases of $20 per ton in february 2023, $20 per ton in may 2023, and $20 per ton in november 2023, a total decrease of $70 per ton during 2023. for corrugating medium, index prices decreased $30 per ton in january 2023, followed by additional decreases of $20 per ton in february 2023, $40 per ton in may 2023, and $20 per ton in november 2023, a total decrease of $110 per ton during 2023.
the market for communication papers competes heavily with electronic data transmission and document storage alternatives. increasing shifts to these alternatives have reduced usage of traditional print media and communication papers. trade publications reported north american uncoated freesheet paper shipments decreased (9.7%) in 2023, compared to 2022. although average prices reported by a trade publication for cut size office papers were higher by $57 per ton, or 4%, in 2023 compared to 2022, index prices declined throughout the year. for cut size office papers, index prices decreased $20 per ton in april 2023, followed by additional decreases of $10 per ton in june 2023 and $20 per ton in october 2023, a total decrease of $50 per ton during 2023. for offset printing papers, index prices decreased $30 per ton in april 2023, followed by additional decreases of $10 per ton in june 2023, $20 per ton in august 2023, $10 per ton in september 2023, and $15 per ton in november 2023, a total decrease of $85 per ton during 2023.
outlook for the first quarter of 2024, compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, in our packaging segment, we expect higher total corrugated products shipments from continued strong demand along with two additional shipping days in the first quarter. containerboard volume is expected to be lower due to a prolonged outage at the jackson mill for the conversion of the no. 3 machine and a scheduled maintenance outage at our counce, tn mill. we have restarted the no. 2 machine at the wallula mill, which will partially offset the effect of these outages. prices and mix should be slightly higher as we implement our january price increases, which will be partially offset by a decrease in the published prices that occurred late in 2023. we expect export containerboard prices to be flat. in our paper segment, we expect an improved mix to move prices slightly higher with flat sales volume. recycled fiber and energy prices will be higher, and seasonally colder weather will negatively impact usages and yields for energy, wood and chemicals along with higher operating costs associated with the restart of full operations at the wallula mill compared to fourth quarter operations. labor and benefits costs will have seasonal timing-related increases that occur at the beginning of a new year related to annual wage and benefit increases, the restart of payroll taxes, and share-based compensation expenses. scheduled outage expenses will be higher and will include the significant first quarter impact of the conversion outage at our jackson mill. considering these items, we expect first quarter earnings to be lower than the fourth quarter of 2023.

we discuss these items in more detail in note 6, other expense, net of the condensed notes to the consolidated financial statements in "part ii, item 8. financial statements" of this form 10-k.
income from operations income from operations decreased $346 million, or (24.3%), for the year ended december 31, 2023, compared to 2022. income from operations in 2023 included $25 million of expense for special items compared to $14 million in 2022. special items in 2023 included $14 million of expense related to corrugated facility closure and other costs and $11 million for jackson mill conversion-related activities. special items in 2022 consisted of $14 million of expense for jackson mill conversion-related activities, $1 million of corrugated facility closure and other costs, and $1 million of income related to acquisition and integration-related activities.
packaging. segment income from operations decreased $349 million to $1,074 million, compared to $1,424 million in 2022. the decrease in 2023 related primarily to lower containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix ($373 million), lower sales and production volumes ($123 million), higher depreciation expense ($47 million), and higher freight expense ($14 million), partially offset by lower operating and converting costs ($163 million), lower annual outage expense ($36 million), and other costs ($18 million). special items in 2023 included $14 million of expense for corrugated facility closure and other costs. special items in 2022 included $5 million of expense for jackson mill conversion-related activities, corrugated facility closure and other costs, and income related to acquisition and integration-related activities.
paper. segment income from operations increased $16 million to $119 million, compared to $103 million in 2022. the increase, excluding special items, primarily related to higher paper prices and mix ($40 million), lower freight expense ($14 million), and lower other costs ($2 million), partially offset by lower sales and production volumes ($23 million), higher operating costs ($13 million), and higher annual outage expense ($1 million). special items in 2023 included $11 million of expense for jackson mill conversion-related activities. special items in 2022 included $9 million of expense for jackson mill conversion-related activities.
non-operating pension expense, interest expense, net and income taxes during 2023, non-operating pension expense increased $22 million compared to 2022. the increase in non-operating pension expense was related to unfavorable 2022 asset performance, partially offset by favorable assumption changes.
interest expense, net, during 2023 decreased $17 million compared to 2022. the decrease in interest expense, net in 2023 was primarily due to higher interest income due to higher rates on invested cash balances compared to 2022.
during 2023, we recorded $249 million of income tax expense, compared to $335 million of income tax expense during 2022. the effective tax rate for both 2023 and 2022 was 24.5%.
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash our primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. we ended the year with $648 million of cash and cash equivalents, $558 million of marketable debt securities, and $323 million of unused borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility, net of letters of credit. on november 30, 2023, we issued $400 million of 5.70% senior notes due 2033 through a registered public offering and invested the net proceeds received from this issuance in time deposits, which are included in marketable debt securities. we intend to use the net proceeds from this issuance, together with a portion of cash on hand, to redeem, repurchase, or otherwise repay at or prior to maturity our outstanding 3.65% senior notes due 2024, which mature on september 15, 2024. see note 10, debt, of the consolidated financial statements included in "part ii, item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this form 10-k as well as information provided below under "-investing activities" and "-financing activities" for further information.
currently, our primary uses of cash are for operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service, common stock dividends, and repurchases of common stock. we believe that net cash generated from operating activities, cash on hand, available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital requirements, including payments of any declared common stock dividends, for the foreseeable future. as our debt or credit facilities become due, we will need to repay, extend or replace such facilities. our ability to do so will be subject to future economic conditions and financial, business, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
below is a summary table of our cash flows, followed by a discussion of our sources and uses of cash through operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities (dollars in millions):

operating activities our operating cash flow is primarily driven by our earnings and changes in operating assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, as well as other factors described below. cash requirements for operating activities are subject to pca's operating needs and the timing of collection of receivables and payments of payables and expenses.
during 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,315 million, compared to $1,495 million for 2022, a decrease of $180 million. cash from operations excluding changes in cash used for operating assets and liabilities decreased $258 million, primarily due to lower income from operations in 2023 as discussed above. cash increased by $78 million due to changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily due to the following:
a)a net favorable change in income taxes due to lower tax payments during 2023 compared to 2022;
b)a net favorable change in inventories in 2023 compared to 2022 due to a smaller increase in packaging segment inventory levels in 2023, primarily in raw materials and finished goods, partially offset by an increase in paper segment inventory levels due to softening demand during 2023; and c)a net favorable change in accounts payable in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily related to higher production volumes during the last quarter of 2023 compared to 2022.
these favorable changes were partially offset by:
a)a net unfavorable change in accounts receivable levels in 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher sales and production volumes in the packaging segment during the latter portion of 2023, partially offset by lower pricing in the packaging segment in 2023; and b)a net unfavorable change in accrued liabilities in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily related to lower accruals for employee compensation and benefit liabilities and a decrease in customer rebates related to the timing of payments and lower sales volumes in 2023.
investing activities we used $875 million for investing activities in 2023, compared to $834 million in 2022. in 2023, we spent $470 million for internal capital investments, compared to $824 million in 2022. additionally, in november 2023, we invested the net proceeds received from the issuance of our $400 million of 5.70% senior notes due 2033 in time deposits, which are included in marketable debt securities.
the details of capital expenditures for property and equipment, excluding acquisitions, by segment for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 are included in the table below (dollars in millions).
year ended december 31,
2023                  2022

$469.7                  $824.2
we expect capital investments in 2024 to be between $470 million and $490 million. these expenditures could increase or decrease as a result of a number of factors, including our financial results, strategic opportunities, future economic conditions, and our regulatory compliance requirements. we currently estimate capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations will be about $15 million in 2024. our estimated environmental expenditures could vary significantly depending upon the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations. for additional information, see "environmental matters" in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
financing activities in 2023, net cash used for financing activities was $112 million, compared to $960 million of cash used for financing activities in 2022, a decrease of $848 million. we paid $449 million in dividends on our common stock in 2023, compared to $420 million paid in 2022. we repurchased and retired 0.3 million shares of the company's common stock for $42 million in 2023, compared to repurchases of 4.0 million shares for $523 million in 2022.
in november 2023, we issued $400 million of 5.70% senior notes due 2033 through a registered public offering. the company paid $4 million of debt issuance costs associated with the new notes, of which $3 million was funded using the net proceeds received from the issuance of new notes and $1 million was funded using cash on hand. the net proceeds received from the issuance of the new notes were invested in time deposits. we intend to use the net proceeds from this issuance, together with a portion of cash on hand, to redeem, repurchase, or otherwise repay at or prior to maturity our outstanding 3.65% senior notes due 2024, which mature on september 15, 2024.

off-balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2023.
inflation and other general cost increases we are subject to both contractual, inflation, and other general cost increases. if we are unable to offset these cost increases by price increases, growth, and/or cost reductions in our operations, these inflation and other general cost increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows, profitability, and liquidity.
in 2023, our total company costs including cost of sales (cos) and selling, general, and administrative expenses (sg&a) was $6.7 billion, and excluding non-cash costs (depreciation, depletion and amortization, pension and postretirement expense, and share-based compensation expense) was $6.1 billion. a 1% increase in cos and sg&a costs would increase costs by $67 million and cash costs by $61 million.
certain items of product input costs have historically been subject to more cost volatility including fiber, purchased energy, and chemicals.
energy our mills represent about 90% of our total purchased fuel costs. in 2023, our packaging and paper mills consumed about 93 million mmbtus of fuel, including internally generated and externally purchased, to produce both steam and electricity. the following table for 2023 provides the total mmbtus purchased externally by fuel type each quarter and the average cost per mmbtu by fuel type for the year. the cost per mmbtu includes the cost of the fuel plus our transportation and delivery costs.

regulatory and environmental matters our operations are subject to our compliance with the laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, primarily in the united states. of particular importance are laws and regulations relating to the environment and health and safety matters.
environmental compliance requirements are a significant factor affecting our business. we employ processes in the manufacture of containerboard, paper, and pulp, which result in various discharges, emissions and waste disposal. these processes are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. we operate and expect to continue to operate, under environmental permits and similar authorizations from various governmental authorities that regulate such discharges, emissions, and waste disposal. the most significant of these laws affecting the company are:
•resource conservation and recovery act (rcra);
•clean water act (cwa);
•clean air act (caa);
•the emergency planning and community right-to-know-act (epcra);
•toxic substance control act (tsca); and
•safe drinking water act (sdwa).
we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations. because environmental regulations are constantly evolving, the company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws. the company works diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations and does not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect its business or financial condition. for both the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, we spent $50 million, and in 2021, we spent $44 million, to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws. additionally, we had $14 million of environmental capital expenditures in 2023, $11 million in 2022, and $10 million in 2021.
in january 2013, the u.s. environmental protection agency (the "epa") established a three-year deadline for compliance with the boiler mact regulations, establishing air emissions standards and certain other requirements for industrial boilers. pca's compliance actions involved modifying or replacing certain boilers, and all pca mills are in full compliance with boiler mact requirements. on july 29, 2016, the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit issued a ruling on the consolidated cases challenging boiler mact. the court vacated key portions of the rule, including emission limits for certain subcategories of solid fuel boilers, and remanded issues to the epa for further rulemaking. at this time, we cannot predict with certainty how this decision will impact our existing boiler mact compliance efforts or whether we will incur additional costs to comply with any revised standards.
as is the case with any industrial operation, pca has, in the past, incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination, as required by the federal comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act, commonly known as the federal "superfund" law, and analogous state laws. cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties the company currently owns or operates, former facilities and off-site facilities where the company has disposed of hazardous substances. as part of the sale to pca of the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation in april 1999, pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with pre-closing off-site waste disposal. pactiv also retained environmentally impaired real property in filer city, michigan unrelated to current mill operations. in addition, officemax (now an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of odp) retains responsibility for certain environmental liabilities related to some of the businesses, facilities, and assets we acquired from boise. generally, this responsibility relates to hazardous substance releases and other environmental incidents that arose before 2004. some of these liabilities could be significant; however, odp may not have sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnification obligations, and in some cases, we may not be entitled to such indemnification.
because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict, meaning that liability is imposed without fault, joint and several, meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution, and retroactive, pca could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material. from 2006 through 2023, there were no significant environmental remediation costs at pca's mills and corrugated plants. as of december 31, 2023, we maintained an environmental reserve of $25.8 million relating to on-site landfills and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects. the company believes that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenses above the $25.8 million accrued at december 31, 2023, will have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
while legislation regarding the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions has been proposed at the federal level, it is uncertain whether such legislation will be passed and, if so, what the breadth and scope of such legislation will be. the result of the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could be an increase in our future environmental compliance costs through carbon cap and trade systems, carbon or other related taxes, or additional capital expenditures to modify facilities to reduce carbon emissions, which may be material. however, climate change legislation and the resulting future energy policy could also provide us with opportunities if the use of renewable energy is encouraged. we currently self-generate the majority of our power requirements at our mills using renewable biogenic fuel such as bark, black liquor and biomass, which are derived from renewable and sustainable resources. while we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of any renewable energy incentives, it is uncertain what the ultimate costs and opportunities of any climate change legislation will be and how our business and industry will be affected.
we are seeking to further improve our environmental impact and have voluntarily set goals to reduce our absolute scope 1 and 2 (market-based) greenhouse gas emissions by 35% by 2030 from a 2021 baseline year and to reach net-zero carbon emissions within our own operations and our value chain by 2050. in addition, we and our industry support the american forest & paper association's goal of a 50% reduction in scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 2030 from a 2005 baseline. we have a carbon neutrality team, consisting of a cross-functional group of key operational, engineering, environmental, and sustainability personnel to lead our efforts. our strategy to achieve greenhouse gas emissions reductions is premised upon the carbon neutrality of the biogenic fuels used in our operations and we believe that meaningful reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved through investment in more efficient operations utilizing carbon-neutral fuels and in emerging and advancing technologies. we regularly work to identify and implement projects that will improve our efficiency. to what extent and when we embark upon major capital projects to reduce emissions will depend in part upon technology advancements, emerging regulatory and tax policies involving greenhouse gas emissions and incentives to invest in projects that reduce emissions. we also regularly assess the use of alternative, non-emitting energy sources at our own facilities (such as solar) and opportunities to support additive carbon-free grid power via renewable energy certificates (recs) and power purchase agreements (ppas), where feasible to do so, and partnering with utilities to procure carbon-free power where opportunities exist. we annually report key data to our stakeholders regarding our greenhouse gas emissions, among other things, in our responsibility report. our responsibility report is available on our website and is not intended to be incorporated by reference herein.
we are also subject to extensive federal, state and local laws related to workplace health and safety, and our safety management system includes measures to assure compliance with these laws and regulations. we do not believe that future compliance with health and safety laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. on an ongoing basis, pca evaluates its estimates, including those related to business combinations, goodwill and intangible assets, pensions and other postretirement benefits, environmental liabilities, income taxes, and long-lived asset impairment, among others. pca bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
critical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results. these estimates require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. we review the development, selection, and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. the company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity:
pensions the company accounts for defined benefit pension plans in accordance with accounting standards codification ("asc") 715, compensation - retirement benefits. the calculation of pension expense and pension liabilities requires decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect expense and liability amounts, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, expected rate of compensation increases, longevity and service lives of participants, expected contributions, and other factors. the pension assumptions used to measure pension expense and liabilities are discussed in note 12, employee benefit plans and other postretirement benefits, of the notes to consolidated financial statements in "part ii, item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this form 10-k.
we recognize the funded status of our pension plans on our consolidated balance sheet and recognize the actuarial and experienced gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits as a component of "accumulated other comprehensive loss" in our consolidated statement of changes in stockholders' equity. actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense in future periods. at december 31, 2023, we had $70.7 million of actuarial losses and prior service costs, net of tax, recorded in "accumulated other comprehensive loss" on our consolidated balance sheet. accumulated losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of assets will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active employees in the pca plans (which is between six and nine years) and over the average remaining lifetime of inactive participants of the boise plan (which is approximately 23 years), to the extent that losses are not offset by gains in subsequent years. while we believe that the assumptions used to measure our pension obligations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and future expense.
we believe that the accounting estimate related to pensions is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period. as discussed above, the future effects of pension plans on our financial position and results of operations will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, retirement rates, investment performance, and funding decisions, among other factors. the following table presents selected assumptions used and expected to be used in the measurement of pension expense in the following periods (dollars in millions):

reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures to reported amounts net income excluding special items, ebitda, and ebitda excluding special items are non-gaap financial measures. management excludes special items, as it believes that these items are not necessarily reflective of the ongoing operations of our business. these measures are presented because they provide a means to evaluate the performance of our segments and our company on an ongoing basis using the same measures that are used by our management, because these measures assist in providing a meaningful comparison between periods and because these measures are frequently used by investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies and the performance of their segments. any analysis of non-gaap financial measures should be done in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap. the non-gaap measures are not intended to be substitutes for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such. reconciliations of the non-gaap measures to the most comparable measure reported in accordance with gaap for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 follow (dollars in millions):

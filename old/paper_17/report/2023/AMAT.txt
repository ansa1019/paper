item 1a:      risk factors the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm, and should be carefully considered in evaluating our business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report.
business and industry risks the industries we serve can be volatile and difficult to predict.
we are a supplier to the global semiconductor and display and related industries, which historically have been cyclical and are subject to volatility and sudden changes in customer demand. factors that impact demand for our products and services include technology inflections and advances in fabrication processes, new and emerging technologies and market drivers, production capacity relative to demand for chips and display technologies, end-user demand, customers' capacity utilization, production volumes, access to affordable capital, business and consumer buying patterns and general economic and political conditions. changes in demand can affect the timing and amounts of customer investments in technology and manufacturing equipment and can significantly impact our operating results. the amount and mix of our customers' capital equipment spending between different products and technologies can also significantly impact our operating results.
to meet rapidly changing demand, we must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage our resources, investments, production capacity, supply chain, workforce, inventory, and other components of our business. we may incur unexpected or additional costs to align our business operations with changes in demand. if we do not effectively manage these challenges, our business performance and operating results may be adversely impacted. even with effective allocation of resources and management of costs, our gross and operating margins, cash flows and earnings may be adversely impacted during periods of changing demand.
we are exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy.
uncertain or adverse economic and business conditions, including uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets, national debt, fiscal or monetary concerns, rising inflation and interest rates, bank failures, and economic recession, could materially and adversely impact our operating results. markets for semiconductors and displays depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for electronic products. uncertain or adverse economic and business conditions could result in decreases in consumer spending and demand. decreases in spending and demand have caused, and may in the future cause, our customers to push out, cancel or refrain from purchasing our equipment or services, which could negatively impact demand for our products and services, reduce our backlog, increase our inventory, and materially and adversely impact our operating results.
sudden increases in demand for electronic products have caused, and may in the future cause, a shortage of parts and materials needed to manufacture our products. such shortages, and shipment delays due to transportation capacity and interruptions, have adversely impacted, and may in the future adversely impact, our suppliers' ability to meet our requirements. accelerated digital transformation may further increase demand and exacerbate shortages and strain our manufacturing capacity, which may adversely impact our ability to meet customer demand and have an adverse impact on our revenues, operating results and financial condition.
uncertain or adverse economic and market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, increased costs or reduced profitability may cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can result in lower sales, additional inventory or bad debt expense. economic and industry uncertainty may impair the ability of suppliers to deliver parts and negatively affect our ability to manage operations and deliver our products. these conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively.
uncertain economic and industry conditions and supply chain challenges make it more difficult to accurately forecast operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect our businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. if we do not appropriately manage our business operations in response to changing economic and industry conditions, it could have a material and adverse impact on our business performance and financial condition. we may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely impact our ability to capitalize on opportunities. even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower demand, we must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support our customers, which can have a negative impact on our operating results.
we maintain an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. the risks to our investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate due to rising inflation, rising interest rates, bank failures or economic recession and, as a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio and returns on pension assets, could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. we also maintain cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations. if any of these financial institutions become insolvent, it could limit our ability to access cash in the affected accounts, which could affect our ability to manage our operations.
we are exposed to the risks of operating a global business.
we have product development, engineering, manufacturing, sales and other operations in many countries, and some of our business activities are concentrated in certain geographic areas. in fiscal 2023, approximately 85% of our net sales were to customers in regions outside the united states. as a result of the global nature of our operations, our business performance and results of operations may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:
•uncertain global economic, political and business conditions and demand;
•global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade and export regulations, trade policies and sanctions, tariffs, and international trade disputes, including new and changing export regulations and their impact on our ability to export products and provide services to customers;
•positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national, commercial or security issues posed by the development, sale or export of certain raw materials, products and technologies;
•political instability, natural disasters, regional or global health epidemics, social unrest, terrorism, acts of war or other geopolitical turmoil, or cybersecurity incidents in locations where we have operations, suppliers or sales, or that may influence the value chain of the industries we serve;
•political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries, including in china, the united states, and countries in europe and asia, that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors and reduce dependence on foreign semiconductor equipment and manufacturing capabilities through policies and financial incentives;
•efforts to influence us to conduct more or less of our operations and sourcing in a particular country;
•different and changing local, regional, national or international laws and regulations, including contract, intellectual property, cybersecurity, data privacy, labor, tax, and import/export laws, and the interpretation and application of laws and regulations;
•ineffective or inadequate legal protection of intellectual property rights in certain countries;
•interruptions to our or our suppliers' supply chain;
•the availability of, and increases and volatility of, raw materials, commodity, energy and shipping costs;
•delays or restrictions on personnel travel and in shipping materials or products;
•geographically diverse operations and projects, and our ability to maintain appropriate business processes, procedures and internal controls, and comply with environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption and other regulatory requirements;
•challenges in hiring and integrating workers in different countries, and in effectively managing a diverse workforce with different experience levels, languages, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations, and differing employment practices and labor issues;
•the ability to develop relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments;
•fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the u.s. dollar against the japanese yen, israeli shekel, euro, taiwanese dollar, singapore dollar, chinese yuan or korean won;
•the need to provide technical support in different locations around the world;
•performance of geographically diverse third-party providers, including certain engineering, software development, manufacturing, information technology and other functions;
•service interruptions from utilities, transportation, data hosting or telecommunications providers;
•impacts of climate change on our operations and those of our customers and suppliers;
•the increasing need for a mobile workforce and travel to different regions; and
•uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries, including for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors and displays in the developing economies of certain countries.
global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade policies and export regulations, including import and export license requirements, trade sanctions, tariffs and international trade disputes, have adversely impacted and could further adversely impact our business and operations, and reduce the competitiveness of our products relative to local and global competitors.
we sell a significant majority of our products into jurisdictions outside of the united states, including china, taiwan, korea and japan. we also purchase a significant portion of equipment and supplies from suppliers outside of the united states. there is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships among the united states and the countries in which we conduct our business, that political, diplomatic, and national security factors can lead to global trade restrictions and changes in trade policies and export regulations, in particular, with respect to those affecting the semiconductor industry. the united states and other countries have imposed and may continue to impose new trade restrictions and export regulations, and have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods. trade restrictions and export regulations, or increases in tariffs and additional taxes, including any retaliatory measures, can negatively impact end-user demand and customer investment in manufacturing equipment, increase our supply chain complexity and our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or restrict our ability to sell products, provide services or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, any or all of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
for example, certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses, and our inability to obtain such licenses has limited and could further limit our markets and negatively impact our business. in the past two years, the u.s. government announced new export regulations for u.s. semiconductor technology sold in china, including wafer fabrication equipment and related parts and services, which have limited the market for certain of our products, adversely impacted our revenues, and increased our exposure to foreign competition. the u.s. department of commerce has promulgated rules and regulations expanding export license requirements for u.s. companies that sell certain products to entities in china whose actions or functions are intended to support military end uses, eliminated certain export license exceptions that applied to exports of certain items to china, added certain chinese companies to its "entity list" and "unverified list," making those companies subject to additional licensing requirements, and expanded licensing requirements for exports to china of items for use in the development or production of integrated circuits and certain technologies. these rules and regulations require us to obtain additional export licenses to supply certain of our products or provide services to certain customers in china. obtaining export licenses may be difficult, costly and time-consuming, and there is no assurance we will be issued licenses on a timely basis or at all. our inability to obtain such licenses could limit our markets in china, may cause us to be displaced by foreign businesses and competitors and adversely affect our results of operations. the implementation and interpretation of these complex rules and other regulatory actions taken by the u.s. government is uncertain and evolving, and may make it more challenging for us to manage our operations and forecast our operating results. the u.s. and other government agencies may promulgate new or additional export licensing or other requirements that have the effect of further limiting our ability to provide certain products and services to customers outside the u.s., including china. the u.s. government may also revise or expand existing requirements or issue guidance clarifying the scope and application of these requirements, which could change the impact of these rules on our business and manufacturing operations. the u.s. government may also continue to add customers to its "entity list" and "unverified list," or take measures that could disrupt our product shipments to certain customers. these and other potential future regulatory changes could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
as a global business with customers, suppliers and operations in many countries around the world, from time to time we may receive inquiries from government authorities about transactions between us and certain foreign entities. in august 2022, we received a subpoena from the u.s. attorney's office for the district of massachusetts requesting information relating to certain china customer shipments. in november 2023, we received a subpoena from the u.s. commerce department's bureau of industry and security requesting the same information. we are cooperating fully with the government in these matters. these inquiries are subject to uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcome of these inquiries, or any other governmental inquires or proceedings that may occur. any violation or alleged violation of law or regulations could result in significant legal costs or in legal proceedings in which we or our employees could be subjected to fines and penalties and could result in restrictions on our business and damage to our global brand and reputation, and could have a material and adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
furthermore, government authorities may take retaliatory actions, impose conditions that require the use of local suppliers or partnerships with local companies, require the license or other transfer of sensitive data or intellectual property, or engage in other efforts to promote local businesses and local competitors, which could have a material and adverse impact on our business. many of these challenges are present in china and korea, markets that represent a significant portion of our business.
we are exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.
a relatively limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of our business. our customer base is geographically concentrated, particularly in china, taiwan, korea and japan. as a result, the actions of even a single customer or export regulations that apply to customers in certain countries, such as those in china, have exposed and can further expose our business and operating results to greater volatility. the geographic concentration of our customer base could shift over time as a result of government policy and incentives to develop regional semiconductor industries. the mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, including as a result of changes in government policy, have varied and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, and have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on our operating results. our products are configured to customer specifications, and changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. if customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders (including as a result of uncertain or adverse economic conditions, our inability to fulfill orders due to export regulations, shortage of parts, transportation capacity/interruptions or any other reason), we may not be able to replace the business, which may have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. the concentration of our customer base increases our risks related to the financial condition of our customers, and the deterioration in financial condition of a single customer or the failure of a single customer to perform its obligations could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow. to the extent our customers experience liquidity constraints, we may incur bad debt expense, which may have a significant impact on our results of operations. major customers may seek pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to us, which may have a negative impact on our business, cash flow, revenue and gross margins.
supply chain disruptions, manufacturing interruptions or delays, or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand, could affect our ability to meet customer demand, lead to higher costs, or result in excess or obsolete inventory.
our business depends on our timely supply of equipment, services and related products to meet the changing requirements of our customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, materials and services from suppliers and contract manufacturers. increases in demand for our products and worldwide demand for electronic products can impact our suppliers' ability to meet our demand requirements, and have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a shortage of parts, materials and services needed to manufacture our products. such shortages, as well as delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions, have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our manufacturing operations and our ability to meet customer demand. volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment can also increase our and our suppliers' capital, technical, operational and other risks, and may cause some suppliers to exit businesses, or scale back or cease operations, which could impact our ability to meet customer demand. ongoing supply chain constraints may continue to increase costs of logistics and parts for our products and may cause us to pass on increased costs to our customers, which may lead to reduced demand for our products and materially and adversely impact our operating results. supply chain disruptions have caused and may continue to cause delays in our equipment production and delivery schedules, which can lead to our business performance becoming significantly dependent on quarter-end production and delivery schedules, and could have an adverse impact on our operating and financial results.
cybersecurity incidents affecting our suppliers could impact our supply chain and may also cause difficulties and delays in our ability to obtain parts, materials and services needed to manufacture our products and provide services, and may adversely impact our manufacturing operations, our ability to meet customer demand, and our operating results. failure to timely recover from such delays could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and may also cause our business and financial outlook to be inaccurate.
we may experience supply chain disruptions, significant interruptions of our manufacturing operations, delays in our ability to deliver or install products or services, increased costs, customer order cancellations or reduced demand for our products as a result of:
•global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade and export regulations, trade policies and sanctions, tariffs, international trade disputes, and new and changing regulations for exports of certain technologies to china, where a significant portion of our supply chain is located, and any retaliatory measures, that adversely impact us or our direct or sub-tier suppliers;
•the failure or inability to accurately forecast demand and obtain quality parts on a cost-effective basis;
•volatility in the availability and cost of parts, commodities, energy and shipping related to our products, including increased costs due to rising inflation or interest rates or other market conditions;
•difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export licenses and approvals;
•shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints;
•a worldwide shortage of semiconductor components as a result of sharp increases in demand for semiconductor products in general;
•limited availability of feasible alternatives to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, which are found in parts, components, process chemicals and other materials supplied to us or used in the operations of our products;
•cybersecurity incidents or information technology or infrastructure failures, including those of a third-party supplier or service provider; and
•natural disasters, the impacts of climate change, or other events beyond our control (such as earthquakes, utility interruptions, tsunamis, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, storms or extreme weather conditions, fires, regional economic downturns, regional or global health epidemics, geopolitical turmoil, increased trade restrictions between the u.s. and china and other countries, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war) in locations where we or our customers or suppliers have manufacturing, research, engineering or other operations.
if a supplier fails to meet our requirements concerning quality, cost, intellectual property protection, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, we may transfer our business to alternative sources. transferring business to alternative suppliers could result in manufacturing delays, additional costs or other difficulties, and may impair our ability to protect, enforce and extract the full value of our intellectual property rights, and the intellectual property rights of our customers and other third parties. these outcomes could have a material and adverse impact on our business and competitive position and subject us to legal proceedings and claims. if we are unable to meet our customers' demand for a prolonged period due to our inability to obtain certain parts or components from suppliers on a timely basis or at all, our business, results of operations and customer relationships could be adversely impacted.
if we need to rapidly increase our business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may strain our manufacturing and supply chain operations, and negatively impact our working capital. if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products, we may purchase more or fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. if we purchase or commit to purchase inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or such inventory is rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or if customers reduce, delay or cancel orders, we may incur excess or obsolete inventory charges.
we are exposed to ongoing changes in the various industries in which we operate.
the global semiconductor, display and related industries are characterized by ongoing changes that impact demand for and the profitability of our products and services and our operating results, including:
•the nature, timing and degree of visibility of changes in end-user demand for electronic products, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to general economic conditions, seasonality or the introduction of new products, and the effects of these changes on customers' businesses and on demand for our products;
•increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers' ability to raise the necessary capital;
•trade, regulatory, tax or government incentives impacting the timing of customers' investment in new or expanded fabrication plants;
•differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and other industries in which we operate;
•the importance of establishing, improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers;
•the cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the adoption rate of new manufacturing technology;
•the importance of reducing the total cost of manufacturing system ownership;
•the importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;
•manufacturers' ability to reconfigure and re-use fabrication systems which can reduce demand for new equipment;
•the importance of developing products with sufficient differentiation to influence customers' purchasing decisions;
•requirements for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment;
•price and performance trends for semiconductor devices and displays, and the impact on demand for such products;
•the importance of the availability of spare parts to maximize the time that customers' systems are available for production;
•government incentives for local suppliers and domestic semiconductor research, development and manufacturing capabilities;
•the increasing role for and complexity of software in our products;
•the increasing role of machine learning and artificial intelligence with respect to semiconductor equipment and related services; and
•the focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations.
we are exposed to ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry.
the largest proportion of our consolidated net sales and profitability is derived from sales of manufacturing equipment in the semiconductor systems segment to the global semiconductor industry, and a majority of the revenues of applied global services is from sales to semiconductor manufacturers. the semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of our semiconductor manufacturing equipment and service products, including:
•the frequency and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, and our ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;
•the cost of research and development due to many factors, including shrinking geometries, the use of new materials, new and more complex device structures, more applications and process steps, increasing chip design costs, and the cost and complexity of integrated manufacturing processes;
•the need to reduce product development time and meet technical challenges;
•the number of types and varieties of semiconductors and number of applications;
•the cost and complexity for semiconductor manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and smaller geometries to volume manufacturing, and the impact on investment in capital equipment;
•semiconductor manufacturers' levels of capital expenditures and the allocation of capital investment to market segments that we do not serve, such as lithography, or segments where our products have lower relative market presence;
•delays in installation of manufacturing equipment delivered to customers;
•the importance of increasing market positions in segments with growing demand;
•semiconductor manufacturers' ability to reconfigure and re-use equipment, resulting in diminished need to purchase new equipment and services from us, and challenges in providing parts for reused equipment;
•shorter cycle times between order placements by customers and product shipment require greater reliance on forecasting of customer investment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin;
•competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance position, including challenges in securing development-tool-of-record (dtor) and production-tool-of-record (ptor) positions with customers;
•consolidation in the semiconductor industry, including among semiconductor manufacturers and among manufacturing equipment suppliers;
•shifts in sourcing strategies by computer and electronics companies, and manufacturing processes for advanced circuit technologies, that impact the equipment requirements of our foundry customers;
•the concentration of new wafer starts in korea and taiwan, where our service penetration and service-revenue-per-wafer-start have been lower than in other regions;
•the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new fabrication plant, while others require less technologically advanced products; and
•the growing importance of specialty markets (such as internet of things, communications, automotive, power and sensors) that use mature process technologies and have a low barrier to entry.
if we do not accurately forecast and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing key technology changes and inflections, successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new technologies, and effectively address industry trends, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted.
we are exposed to ongoing changes specific to the display industry.
the global display industry has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels, due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers, the concentrated nature of end-use applications, production capacity relative to end-use demand, and panel manufacturer profitability. industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs, and on demand for advanced smartphones and mobile device displays, which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features. the display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of our display products and services, including:
•the importance of new types of display technologies, such as organic light-emitting diode (oled), low temperature polysilicon (ltps) and metal oxide transistor backplanes, flexible displays, and new touch panel films;
•the increasing cost of research and development, and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, and our ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;
•the timing and extent of an expansion of manufacturing facilities in china, which may be affected by changes in economic conditions and governmental regulations, including trade policies and export regulations;
•the importance of increasing market positions in products and technologies with growing demand;
•the rate of transition to new display technologies for tvs, information technology products and mobile applications, and augmented and virtual reality applications, and the resulting effect on capital intensity in the industry and on our product differentiation, gross margin and return on investment;
•the concentration of display manufacturer customers, and fluctuations in customer spending quarter over quarter and year over year for display manufacturing equipment; and
•the dependence on a limited number of display manufacturer customers' selection of new technologies, and their ability to successfully commercialize new products and technologies, and uncertainty with respect to future display technology end-use applications and growth drivers.
the display industry has experienced decreased levels of investment in manufacturing equipment. if we do not successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new and emerging display technologies, or if industry demand for display manufacturing equipment and technologies does not grow, our business and our operating results may continue to be adversely impacted.
the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market changes.
we operate in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical, and our future success depends on many factors, including the development of new technologies and effective commercialization and customer acceptance of our equipment, services and related products, and our ability to increase our position in our current markets, expand into adjacent and new markets, and optimize operational performance. the development, introduction and support of products in a geographically diverse and competitive environment requires collaboration with customers and other industry participants, which has grown more complex and expensive over time. new or improved products may entail higher costs, longer development cycles, lower profits and may have unforeseen product design or manufacturing defects. to compete successfully, we must:
•identify and address technology inflections, market changes, competitor innovations, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand in a timely and effective manner;
•develop new products and disruptive technologies, improve and develop new applications for existing products, and adapt products for use by customers in different applications and markets with varying technical requirements;
•complete major infrastructure projects on schedule and on budget, and realize the anticipated benefits of those projects;
•differentiate our products from those of competitors, meet customers' performance specifications (including those related to energy consumption and environmental impact more broadly), appropriately price products, and achieve market acceptance;
•effectively and timely implement artificial intelligence strategies for our product and service offerings, which may be costly or ineffective, introduce errors, cause loss of intellectual property, and raise complex regulatory compliance, intellectual property and other issues;
•maintain operating flexibility to enable responses to changing markets, applications and customer requirements;
•enhance our worldwide operations across our businesses to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability;
•focus on product development and sales and marketing strategies that address customers' high value problems and strengthen customer relationships;
•effectively allocate resources between our existing products and markets, the development of new products, and expanding into new and adjacent markets;
•improve the productivity of capital invested in r&d activities;
•accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet production schedules for our products;
•improve our manufacturing processes and achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings;
•adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain;
•qualify products for evaluation and volume manufacturing with our customers; and
•implement changes in our design engineering methodology to reduce material costs and cycle time, increase commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, and improve product life cycle management.
if we do not successfully anticipate technology inflections, develop and commercialize new products and technologies, and respond to changes in customer requirements and market trends, our business performance and operating results may be materially and adversely impacted.
we are exposed to risks associated with expanding into new and related markets and industries.
as part of our growth strategy, we seek to continue to expand into related or new markets and industries, either with our existing products or with new products developed internally, or those developed in collaboration with third parties, or obtained through acquisitions. our ability to successfully expand our business into new and related markets and industries may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:
•the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for, and operate in, new markets;
•the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies, and to develop relationships with new customers;
•differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses;
•our ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;
•the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply chain management and logistics;
•the adoption of new business models, business processes and systems;
•the complexity of entering into and effectively managing strategic alliances or partnering opportunities;
•new materials, processes and technologies;
•the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas;
•new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some with limited operating histories, uncertain or limited funding, evolving business models or locations in regions where we do not have, or have limited, operations;
•new or different competitors with potentially more financial or other resources, industry experience and established customer relationships;
•entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business, employment and safety practices and requirements;
•third parties' intellectual property rights; and
•the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry standards and practices.
from time to time we receive funding from the united states and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase our research and development resources and address new market opportunities. as a condition to this government funding, we are often subject to certain record-keeping, audit, intellectual property rights-sharing, and/or other obligations.
operational and financial risks we are exposed to risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.
our success depends on the protection of our technology using patents, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, such as the manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts that use our technology without authorization, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities. monitoring and detecting any unauthorized access, use or disclosure of our intellectual property is difficult and costly and we cannot be certain that the protective measures we have implemented will completely prevent misuse. our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks and uncertainty as to the protection and enforceability of those rights in some countries. if we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights, we may be subject to claims that those rights are invalid or unenforceable, and others may seek counterclaims against us, which could have a negative impact on our business. if we are unable to enforce and protect intellectual property rights, or if they are circumvented, rendered obsolete, invalidated by the rapid pace of technological change, or stolen or misappropriated by employees or third parties, it could have an adverse impact on our competitive position and business. changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation may impact our ability to protect and assert our intellectual property rights, increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications or related enforcement actions, and diminish the value and competitive advantage conferred by our intellectual property assets.
from time to time third parties have asserted, and may continue to assert, intellectual property claims against us and our products. claims that our products infringe the rights of others, whether or not meritorious, can be expensive and time-consuming to defend and resolve, and may divert the efforts and attention of management and personnel. the inability to obtain rights to use third-party intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could have an adverse impact on our business. we may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information. any such incidents and claims could severely harm our business and reputation, result in significant expenses, harm our competitive position, and prevent us from selling certain products, all of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
we are exposed to cybersecurity threats and incidents.
in the conduct of our business, we collect, use, transmit, store, and otherwise process data using information technology systems, including systems owned and maintained by us or our third-party providers. these data include confidential information and intellectual property belonging to us or our customers or other business partners, and personal information of individuals. all information technology systems are subject to disruptions, outages, failures, and security breaches or incidents. we and our third-party providers have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cybersecurity incidents. cybersecurity incidents may range from employee or contractor error or misuse or unauthorized use of information technology systems or confidential information, to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to these information systems, to sophisticated cybersecurity attacks, known as advanced persistent threats, any of which may target us directly or indirectly through our third-party providers and global supply chain. cybersecurity attacks are increasing in number and the attackers are increasingly organized and well-financed, or at times supported by state actors. geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as russia's invasion of ukraine or increasing tension with china, may create a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks. to the extent artificial intelligence capabilities improve and are increasingly adopted, they may be used to identify vulnerabilities and craft increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity attacks. vulnerabilities may be introduced from the use of artificial intelligence by us, our customers, suppliers and other business partners and third-party providers. although we are not aware of any cybersecurity incidents impacting us directly that have been material to us to date, we continue to devote significant resources to network security, data encryption, and other measures to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse, and we may be required to expend greater resources in the future, especially in the face of evolving and increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity threats and laws, regulations, and other actual and asserted obligations to which we are or may become subject relating to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity. we may be unable to anticipate, prevent, or remediate future attacks, vulnerabilities, breaches, or incidents, and in some instances we may be unaware of vulnerabilities or cybersecurity breaches or incidents or their magnitude and effects, particularly as attackers are becoming increasingly able to circumvent controls and remove forensic evidence. cybersecurity incidents may result in business disruption; delay in the development and delivery of our products; disruption of our manufacturing processes, internal communications, interactions with customers and suppliers and processing and reporting financial results; the theft or misappropriation of intellectual property; corruption, loss of, or inability to access (e.g., through ransomware or denial of service) confidential information and critical data (i.e., that of our company and our third-party providers and customers); reputational damage; private claims, demands, and litigation or regulatory investigations, enforcement actions, or other proceedings related to contractual or regulatory privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, or other confidentiality obligations; diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering; and increased costs associated with the implementation of cybersecurity measures to detect, deter, protect against, and recover from such incidents. our efforts to comply with, and changes to, laws, regulations, and contractual and other actual and asserted obligations concerning privacy, cybersecurity, and data protection, including developing restrictions on cross-border data transfer and data localization, could result in significant expense, and any actual or alleged failure to comply could result in inquiries, investigations, and other proceedings against us by regulatory authorities or other third parties. customers and third-party providers increasingly demand rigorous contractual provisions regarding privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, confidentiality, and intellectual property, which may increase our overall compliance burden.
we are exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions, strategic investments and divestitures.
we may engage in acquisitions of or investments in companies, technologies or products in existing, related or new markets. business combinations, acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks to our business, financial condition and operating results, including:
•inability to complete proposed transactions timely or at all due to the failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals, litigation or other disputes, and any ensuing obligation to pay a termination fee;
•diversion of management's attention and disruption of ongoing businesses;
•the failure to realize expected revenues, gross and operating margins, net income and other returns from acquired businesses;
•requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures and restrictions on the conduct of our existing business or the acquired business;
•following completion of acquisitions, ineffective integration of businesses, operations, systems, digital and physical security, technologies, products, employees, compliance programs, changes in laws or regulations, including tax laws, or other factors, may impact the ability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits;
•failure to commercialize technologies from acquired businesses or developed through strategic investments;
•dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;
•inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from our existing markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships;
•failure to retain and motivate key employees of acquired businesses;
•the impact of the announcement or consummation of a proposed transaction on relationships with third parties;
•changes in our credit rating, which could adversely impact our access to and cost of capital;
•increases in debt obligations to finance activities associated with a transaction, which increase interest expense, and reductions in cash balances, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes, including share repurchases and dividends;
•exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where we have not historically conducted business;
•challenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more widespread operations, projects and people;
•inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies;
•inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company's internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, cybersecurity, privacy policies and compliance programs, or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices;
•impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the segment;
•the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;
•unknown, underestimated, undisclosed or undetected commitments or liabilities, including potential intellectual property infringement claims, or non-compliance with laws, regulations or policies; and
•the inappropriate scale of acquired entities' critical resources or facilities for business needs.
we make investments in other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline in value or not meet desired objectives. the success of these investments depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures, requires ongoing and effective cooperation with partners. in addition, new legislation, additional regulations or global economic or political conditions may affect or impair our ability to invest in certain countries or require us to obtain regulatory approvals to do so. we may not receive the necessary regulatory approvals or the approvals may come with significant conditions or obligations. the risks to our investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges.
we may seek to divest portions of our business that are not deemed to fit with our strategic plan. divestitures involve additional risks and uncertainties, such as ability to sell such businesses on satisfactory price and terms and in a timely manner, or at all, disruption to other parts of the businesses and distraction of management, allocation of internal resources that would otherwise be devoted to completing strategic acquisitions, loss of key employees or customers, exposure to unanticipated liabilities or ongoing obligations to support the businesses following such divestitures, and other adverse financial impacts.
the ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to our success.
our success depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders with the necessary expertise and capabilities, representing diverse backgrounds and experiences. achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, management or organizational changes, ongoing competition for talent, the availability of qualified employees, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs, our career growth and development opportunities, and our employment policies. if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders, we may be unable to fully capitalize on current and new market opportunities, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. the loss of knowledgeable and experienced employees may result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls.
we operate in jurisdictions with complex and changing tax laws.
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. our provision for income taxes and effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in applicable tax laws, interpretations of applicable tax laws, amount and composition of pre-tax income in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, and valuation of deferred tax assets.
there have been a number of proposed changes in the tax laws that, if enacted, would increase our tax liability. while it is too early to predict the outcome of these proposals, if enacted, they could have a material impact on our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. an increase in our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate could, in turn, have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. for example, several countries where we do business have announced plans to implement global minimum tax regimes based on the organization for economic cooperation and development base erosion and profit shifting project. if implemented, these global minimum tax regimes would change various aspects of the existing framework under which our global tax obligations are determined, which would unfavorably impact our existing tax incentives and effective tax rate. as this framework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country, the timing and ultimate impact of any such changes on our tax obligations are uncertain.
consistent with the international nature of our business, we conduct certain manufacturing, supply chain, and other operations in asia, bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs. in some foreign jurisdictions, we must meet certain requirements to continue to qualify for tax incentives. there is no assurance we will be able to meet such requirements in the future to fully realize benefits from these incentives. furthermore, the proposed plans to implement global minimum tax regimes could reduce or eliminate the benefits of our tax incentives.
we are subject to examination by the u.s. internal revenue service and other tax authorities, and from time to time amend previously filed tax returns. we regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. we may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. there can be no assurance that we will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and effective tax rates.
our indebtedness and debt covenants could adversely affect our financial condition and business.
as of october 29, 2023, we had $5.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes, we may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if we experience a change of control and a contemporaneous downgrade of the notes below investment grade. we also have in place a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. while no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility as of october 29, 2023, we may borrow amounts in the future under this credit facility or enter into new financing arrangements. our ability to satisfy our debt obligations is dependent upon the results of our business operations and subject to other risks discussed in this section. if we fail to satisfy our debt obligations, or comply with financial and other debt covenants, we may be in default and any borrowings may become immediately due and payable, and such default may constitute a default under our other obligations. there can be no assurance that we would have sufficient financial resources or be able to arrange financing to repay any borrowings at such time. significant changes in our credit rating, disruptions in the global financial markets, or incurrence of new or refinancing of existing indebtedness at higher interest rates could have a material and adverse impact on our access to and cost of capital for future financings, and financial condition.
the failure to successfully implement enterprise resource planning and other information systems changes could adversely impact our business and operating results.
we periodically implement new or enhanced enterprise resource planning and related information systems in order to better manage our business operations, align our global organizations and enable future growth. implementation of new business processes and information systems requires the commitment of significant personnel, training and financial resources, and entails risks to our business operations. if we do not successfully implement enterprise resource planning and related information systems improvements, or if there are delays or difficulties in implementing these systems, we may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and may experience interruptions in service and operational difficulties, which could result in quality issues, reputational harm, lost market and revenue opportunities, and otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we may incur impairment charges related to goodwill or long-lived assets.
we have a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions. goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. the review compares the fair value for each of our reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of our common stock, changes in our strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. we may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist.
we may not continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase our shares.
our ability to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends and share repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and agreements. future dividends and share repurchases may be affected by, among other factors, our cash flow; potential future capital requirements for investments, acquisitions, infrastructure projects, and research and development; changes in applicable tax, corporate, or other laws; contractual restrictions, such as financial or operating covenants in our debt arrangements; and changes to our business model. our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares in any particular amounts or at all. a reduction or suspension in our dividend payments or share repurchases could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock.
legal, compliance, and other risks we are exposed to risks related to legal proceedings, claims and investigations.
from time to time we are, and in the future may be, involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, trade secret misappropriation, other intellectual property rights, trade compliance, including import, export and customs, antitrust, environmental regulations, privacy, data protection, securities, contracts, product performance, product liability, unfair competition, employment, workplace safety, and other matters. we may receive, and have received, inquiries, warrants, subpoenas, and other requests for information in connection with government investigations of potential or suspected violations of law or regulations by our company and/or our employees. we also on occasion receive notifications from customers who believe we owe them indemnification, product warranty or have other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties.
legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations, whether with or without merit, and internal investigations, may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; divert management's attention and our other resources; constrain our ability to sell our products and services; result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines; and negatively affect our business. we cannot predict the outcome of current or future legal proceedings, claims or investigations.
we are exposed to risks related to the global regulatory environment.
we are subject to the laws of the united states and multiple foreign jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions, including those related to financial and other disclosures, accounting standards, corporate governance, intellectual property, tax, trade (including import, export and customs), antitrust, environment, health and safety (including those relating to climate change), employment, immigration and travel regulations, human rights, privacy, data protection and localization, and anti-corruption. changing, inconsistent or conflicting laws, rules and regulations, and ambiguities in their interpretation and application create uncertainty and challenges, and compliance with laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive, divert management time and attention from revenue-generating activities, and otherwise adversely impact our business operations. violations of law, rules and regulations, including, among others, those related to financial and other disclosures, trade, import and export regulations, antitrust, privacy, data protection, and anti-corruption, could result in fines, criminal penalties, restrictions on our business, and damage to our reputation, and could have an adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
our environmental, social and governance strategies and targets could result in additional costs, and our inability to achieve them could have an adverse impact on our reputation and performance.
we periodically communicate our strategies and targets related to sustainability, carbon emissions, diversity and inclusion, human rights, and other environmental, social and governance matters. these strategies and targets, and their underlying assumptions and projections, reflect our current plans and aspirations, and we may be unable to achieve them. changing customer and shareholder sustainability expectations and regulatory requirements, as well as our sustainability targets, could cause us to incur substantial expense and alter our manufacturing, operations or equipment designs and processes. any failure or perceived failure to timely meet these sustainability requirements, expectations or targets, or a failure to realize the anticipated benefits of planned investments and technology innovations related to sustainability, could adversely impact the demand for our products and subject us to significant costs and liabilities and reputational risks that could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, standards and processes for measuring and reporting carbon emissions and other sustainability metrics may change over time, and may result in inconsistent data, or could result in significant revisions to our strategies and targets, or our ability to achieve them. any scrutiny of our carbon emissions or other sustainability disclosures, our failure to achieve related strategies and targets, or our failure to disclose our sustainability measures consistent with applicable laws and regulations or to the satisfaction of our stakeholders could negatively impact our reputation or performance.
we are subject to risks associated with environmental, health and safety regulations.
we are subject to environmental, health and safety regulations in connection with our global business operations, including but not limited to: regulations related to the design, manufacture, sale, shipping and use of our products; use, handling, discharge, recycling, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials used in our products or in producing our products; the operation of our facilities; and the use of our real property, including in connection with construction of our infrastructure projects. the failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental, health and safety regulations could result in: significant remediation or other legal liabilities; the imposition of penalties and fines; restrictions on the development, manufacture, sale, shipping or use of certain of our products; limitations on the operation of our facilities or ability to use our real property; and a decrease in the value of our real property. we could be required to alter our product design, manufacturing, and operations, and incur substantial expense in order to comply with environmental, health and safety regulations. any failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to significant costs and liabilities that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
item 7:      management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is intended to facilitate an understanding of our business and results of operations. this md&a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k. the following discussion contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement set forth at the beginning of this form 10-k. md&a consists of the following sections:
•overview: a summary of our business and measurements
•results of operations: a discussion of operating results
•segment information: a discussion of segment operating results
•recent accounting pronouncements: a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and its impact to our consolidated financial statements
•financial condition, liquidity and capital resources: an analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash
•contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements
•critical accounting policies and estimates: a discussion of critical accounting policies that require the exercise of judgments and estimates overview we provide manufacturing equipment, services and software to the semiconductor, display, and related industries. our customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips, liquid crystal and organic light-emitting diode (oled) displays, and other electronic devices. these customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in electronic products. each of our segments is subject to variable industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips, display technologies, and other electronic devices, as well as other factors, such as global economic, political and market conditions, and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes.
we operate in three reportable segments: semiconductor systems, applied global services, and display and adjacent markets. a summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements. a discussion of factors that could affect our operations is set forth under "risk factors" in part i, item 1a, which is incorporated herein by reference. product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in the united states, europe, israel, and asia. our broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force.
our results are driven primarily by customer spending on capital equipment and services to support key technology transitions or to increase production volume in response to worldwide demand for semiconductors and displays. spending by semiconductor customers, which include companies that operate in the foundry, logic, memory, and other semiconductor chip markets, is driven by demand for electronic products, including smartphones and other mobile devices, servers, personal computers, automotive devices, storage, and other products. the growth of data and emerging end-market drivers such as artificial intelligence, the internet of things, 5g networks, smart vehicles and augmented and virtual reality are also creating the next wave of growth for the industry. as a result, products within the semiconductor systems segment are subject to significant changes in customer requirements, including transitions to smaller dimensions, increasingly complex chip architectures, new materials and an increasing number of applications. demand for display manufacturing equipment spending depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs as well as larger and higher resolution displays for next-generation mobile devices, and investments in new types of display technologies. the timing of customer investment in manufacturing equipment is also affected by the timing of next-generation process development and the timing of capacity expansion to meet end-market demand. in light of these conditions, our results can vary significantly year-over-year, as well as quarter-over-quarter.
our strategic priorities include developing products that help solve customers' challenges at technology inflections; expanding our served market opportunities in the semiconductor and display industries; and growing our services business. our long-term growth strategy requires continued development of new materials engineering capabilities, including products and platforms that enable expansion into new and adjacent markets. our significant investments in research, development and engineering must generally enable us to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand, thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans during early-stage technology selection. we work closely with our global customers to design systems and processes that meet their planned technical and production requirements.

fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 each contained 52 weeks, while fiscal 2021 contained 53 weeks.
semiconductor equipment customers continued to make strategic investments in new capacity and new technology transitions during fiscal 2023. foundry and logic spending increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 driven by customer investments in mature manufacturing nodes to serve demand across a wide range of products. memory customers' spending in fiscal 2023 was lower as compared to fiscal 2022 due to deferred capacity additions primarily as a result of weakness in demand for consumer electronic products.
our applied global services net sales in fiscal 2023 increased compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to an increase in sales associated with long-term service agreements and higher customer spending on legacy systems, partially offset by a decrease in net sales due to additional export regulations issued by the united states government in 2022 and lower customer utilization rates. our display and adjacent markets net sales decreased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to lower customer investments in display manufacturing equipment for tvs as a result of weakness in demand for consumer electronic products.
we experienced supply chain and logistics constraints in fiscal 2022, and although there have been significant improvements in supply chain performance in fiscal 2023, we expect some shortages to persist, and managing these supply chain constraints to increase shipments to customers remains a top priority.
in fiscal 2024, we expect advanced foundry and logic demand to be stronger as compared to fiscal 2023 due to increased customer spending in pc, cloud and artificial intelligence (ai) data centers as well as customers' continued investments in new technology. demand for mature manufacturing nodes is expected to be lower as compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to decreased customer spending in the industrial automation and automotive markets. we expect memory customers' spending to be higher as compared to fiscal 2023 as customers continue to invest in new technology.
in the past two years, the united states government announced additional export regulations for u.s. semiconductor technology sold in china. for a description of risks associated with global trade, see the risk factor entitled "business and industry risks - global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade policies and export regulations, including import and export license requirements, trade sanctions, tariffs and international trade disputes, have adversely impacted and could further adversely impact our business and operations, and reduce the competitiveness of our products relative to local and global competitors" in part i, item 1a, "risk factors."

our future operating results depend to a considerable extent on our ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products we provide. development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product, which typically has a shorter development cycle, or a new product, which typically has a longer development cycle. most of our existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies, materials and processes. in certain instances, we acquire technologies, either in existing or new product areas, to complement our existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market.
we believe that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in rd&e to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of our customers' most advanced designs. we have maintained and intend to continue our commitment to investing in rd&e in order to continue to offer new products and technologies.
we continued our rd&e investments in semiconductor systems and display and adjacent markets on the development of new unit process systems and integrated materials solutions. areas of investment include etch, deposition, metrology and inspection, patterning, packaging and other technologies to improve chip performance, power, area, cost and time-to-market. in display and adjacent markets, rd&e investments were focused on expanding our market opportunity with new display technologies.
the increases in rd&e expenses during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 were primarily due to additional headcount, higher depreciation expense and consumable and equipment costs associated with ongoing product development. in addition, the increases in rd&e expenses in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 also included a $30 million impairment of fixed assets. the increases in rd&e expenses during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 were primarily due to additional headcount, higher consumable and equipment costs associated with ongoing product development and share-based compensation expense. these increases reflect our ongoing investments in product development initiatives, consistent with our growth strategy. we continued to prioritize existing rd&e investments in technical capabilities and critical research and development programs in current and new markets, with a focus on semiconductor technologies.
rd&e expenses during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 included $179 million, $151 million and $129 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was lower than fiscal 2022 primarily due to a reduction of deferred tax assets that occurred in fiscal 2022, related to a new tax incentive in singapore. the effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was higher than fiscal 2021 primarily due to a reduction of deferred tax assets related to a new tax incentive in singapore, partially offset by changes in uncertain tax positions.
beginning in our fiscal 2023, the tax cuts and jobs act (tax act), enacted on december 22, 2017, eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over five years for activities performed in the u.s. or fifteen years for activities performed outside of the u.s. this capitalization requirement increases our effective tax rates, deferred tax assets and cash tax liabilities beginning in fiscal 2023.
segment information we report financial results in three segments: semiconductor systems, applied global services, and display and adjacent markets. a description of the products and services, as well as financial data, for each reportable segment can be found in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
the corporate and other category includes revenues from products, as well as costs of products sold, for fabricating solar photovoltaic cells and modules and certain operating expenses that are not allocated to our reportable segments and are managed separately at the corporate level. these operating expenses include costs for share-based compensation; certain management, finance, legal, human resource, and rd&e functions provided at the corporate level; and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy. in addition, we do not allocate to our reportable segments restructuring, severance and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions, unless these actions pertain to a specific reportable segment.
the results for each reportable segment are discussed below.
semiconductor systems segment the semiconductor systems segment is comprised primarily of capital equipment used to fabricate semiconductor chips. semiconductor industry spending on capital equipment is driven by demand for electronic products, including smartphones and other mobile devices, servers, personal computers, automotive electronics, storage, and other products, and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes, and as a result is subject to variable industry conditions. spending can also depend on customer facility readiness and timeline for installation of capital equipment at customer sites. development efforts are focused on solving customers' key technical challenges in transistor, interconnect, patterning and packaging performance.

semiconductor equipment customers continued to make strategic investments in new capacity and new technology transitions during fiscal 2023. foundry and logic spending increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily driven by customer investment in mature manufacturing nodes to serve demand across a wide range of products. spending by memory customers decreased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due to deferred capacity additions primarily as a result of weakness in demand for consumer electronic products. operating margin for fiscal 2023 decreased compared to fiscal 2022, primarily driven by increased rd&e expenses, higher inventory charges, the impact of export regulations, partially offset by favorable changes in customer and product mix, an increase in average selling prices and lower freight and logistics costs.
foundry and logic spending increased in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 driven by customer investment in both advanced and mature nodes. spending by dram customers increased and flash memory customers decreased in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 due to changes in investments in new technology and capacity. operating margin for fiscal 2022 decreased compared to fiscal 2021, primarily driven by higher material, freight, logistics costs and higher personnel costs due to the hiring of additional headcount to provide manufacturing capacity and flexibility, partially offset by favorable changes in product mix and an increase in average selling prices.
applied global services segment the applied global services segment provides integrated solutions to optimize equipment and fab performance and productivity, including spares, upgrades, services, certain remanufactured earlier generation equipment and factory automation software for semiconductor, display and solar products.
demand for applied global services' solutions are driven by our large and growing installed base of manufacturing systems, and customers' needs to shorten ramp times, improve device performance and yield, and optimize factory output and operating costs. industry conditions that affect applied global services' sales of spares and services are primarily characterized by changes in semiconductor manufacturers' wafer starts and higher utilization rates, growth of the installed base of equipment, growing service intensity of newer tools, and our ability to sell more comprehensive service agreements.

net sales for fiscal 2022 increased compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher customer spending on comprehensive service agreements, spares and legacy systems. operating margin for fiscal 2022 decreased compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher expense related to an increase in headcount to support business growth and higher freight costs, partially offset by higher net sales in fiscal 2022.
display and adjacent markets segment the display and adjacent markets segment encompasses products for manufacturing liquid crystal and oled displays, and other display technologies for tvs, monitors, laptops, personal computers, electronic tablets, smart phones, other consumer-oriented devices, equipment upgrades and solar energy cells. the segment is focused on expanding its presence through technologically-differentiated equipment for manufacturing large-scale lcd tvs, oleds, low temperature polysilicon (ltps), metal oxide, and touch panel sectors; and development of products that provide customers with improved performance and yields.
display industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs as well as larger and higher resolution displays for next-generation mobile devices. uneven spending patterns by customers in the display and adjacent markets segment can cause significant fluctuations quarter-over-quarter, as well as year-over-year.

total cash, cash-equivalents and investments          $9,150                        $4,561
sources and uses of cash a summary of cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities is as follows:
2023                                                          2022                      2021
(in millions)

operating activities cash from operating activities for fiscal 2023 was $8.7 billion, which reflects net income adjusted for the effect of non-cash charges and changes in working capital components. significant non-cash charges included depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation and deferred income taxes. cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2023 increased compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to better inventory management, better accounts receivable collections and lower income tax payments, partially offset by higher payments to vendors and lower year over year change in deferred revenue. cash provided by operating activities remained relatively flat in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher inventory and income tax payments, partially offset by higher net income and lower year over year increase in accounts receivable.
we have agreements with various financial institutions to sell accounts receivable and discount promissory notes from selected customers. we sell our accounts receivable generally without recourse. from time to time, we also discount letters of credit issued by customers through various financial institutions. the discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements. we sold $0.7 billion, $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion of accounts receivable during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. we did not discount letters of credit issued by customers in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021. there was no discounting of promissory notes in each of fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021. financing charges on the sale of receivables and discounting of letters of credit are included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and were not material for all years presented.
our working capital was $11.8 billion at october 29, 2023 and $8.5 billion at october 30, 2022.
days sales outstanding of our accounts receivable at the end of fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 was 70 days, 82 days, and 74 days, respectively. days sales outstanding varies due to the timing of shipments and payment terms. the decrease in days sales outstanding at the end of fiscal 2023 was primarily due to a lower accounts receivable balance as a result of the timing of customer payments compared to the end of fiscal 2022. the increase in days sales outstanding at the end of fiscal 2022 was primarily due to higher accounts receivable balance as a result of the timing of customer payments and lower sales of accounts receivables compared to the end of fiscal 2021.
investing activities we used $1.5 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion of cash in investing activities in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. capital expenditures in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $1,106 million, $787 million and $668 million, respectively. capital expenditures were primarily for investments in real property acquisitions and improvements, demonstration and testing equipment, manufacturing and network equipment. net cash paid for acquisitions in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $25 million, $441 million and $12 million, respectively. purchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, for 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $404 million, $129 million and $536 million, respectively. investing activities also included investments in technology to allow us to access new market opportunities or emerging technologies.
our investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade money market mutual funds, u.s. treasury and agency securities, municipal bonds, corporate bonds and mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, as well as equity securities. we regularly monitor the credit risk in our investment portfolio and take appropriate measures, which may include the sale of certain securities, to manage such risks prudently in accordance with our investment policies.
financing activities we used $3.0 billion of cash in financing activities in fiscal 2023, consisting primarily of repurchases of common stock of $2.2 billion, cash dividends to stockholders of $975 million and tax withholding payments for vested equity awards of $179 million, offset by proceeds received from common stock issuances of $227 million and net proceeds from issuances of commercial paper of $91 million.
we used $7.0 billion of cash in financing activities in fiscal 2022, consisting primarily of repurchases of common stock of $6.1 billion, cash dividends to stockholders of $873 million and tax withholding payments for vested equity awards of $266 million, offset by proceeds received from common stock issuances of $199 million.
we used $4.6 billion of cash in financing activities in fiscal 2021, consisting primarily of repurchases of common stock of $3.8 billion, cash dividends to stockholders of $838 million and tax withholding payments for vested equity awards of $178 million, offset by proceeds received from common stock issuances of $175 million.
in march 2023, our board of directors approved a common stock repurchase program authorizing $10.0 billion in repurchases, which supplemented the previously existing $6.0 billion authorization approved in march 2022. at october 29, 2023, approximately $12.7 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under the repurchase program.
during fiscal 2023, our board of directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per share and three quarterly cash dividends of $0.32 per share. during fiscal 2022, our board of directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share and three quarterly cash dividends of $0.26 per share. during fiscal 2021, our board of directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share and three quarterly cash dividends of $0.24 per share. dividends paid during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 amounted to $975 million, $873 million and $838 million, respectively. we currently anticipate that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination by the board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders.
we have credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to $1.6 billion, of which $1.5 billion is comprised of a committed revolving credit agreement (revolving credit agreement) with a group of banks. the revolving credit agreement includes a provision under which we may request an increase in the amount of the facility of up to $500 million for a total commitment of no more than $2.0 billion, subject to the receipt of commitments from one or more lenders for any such increase and other customary conditions. the revolving credit agreement is scheduled to expire in february 2026, unless extended as permitted under the revolving credit agreement. the revolving credit agreement provides for borrowings in united states dollars that bear interest for each advance at one of two rates selected by us, plus an applicable margin, which varies according to our public debt credit ratings. the revolving credit agreement includes financial and other covenants with which we were in compliance as of october 29, 2023.
remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately $53 million are with japanese banks. our ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request, and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks' prime reference rate denominated in japanese yen.
we have a short-term commercial paper program under which we may from time to time issue unsecured commercial paper notes of up to a total amount of $1.5 billion. the proceeds from the issuances of commercial paper are used for general corporate purposes. at october 29, 2023, we had $100 million of commercial paper notes outstanding. the commercial paper program is backstopped by the revolving credit agreement and borrowings under the revolving credit agreement reduce the amount of commercial paper notes we can issue.
we had senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5.5 billion outstanding as of october 29, 2023. see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of existing debt. we may seek to refinance our existing debt and may incur additional indebtedness depending on our capital requirements and the availability of financing.
others on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted the tax act, which requires a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. the transition tax expense is payable in installments over eight years, with eight percent due in each of the first five years starting with fiscal 2018. as of october 29, 2023, we had $612 million of total payments remaining, payable in installments in the next three years.
beginning in fiscal 2023, the tax act eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over five years for activities performed in the u.s. or fifteen years for activities performed outside of the u.s. this capitalization requirement increases our effective tax rates, deferred tax assets and cash tax liabilities beginning in fiscal 2023.
on august 9, 2022, the u.s. government enacted the u.s. chips and science act ("chips act"). the chips act creates a 25% investment tax credit for certain investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing. the credit is provided for qualifying property, which is placed in service after december 31, 2022, for which construction begins before january 1, 2027, and is treated as a government grant. we recognize this investment tax credit when there is reasonable assurance that we will qualify for the credit and the benefit will be received.
on august 16, 2022, the u.s. government enacted the inflation reduction act. the inflation reduction act introduces a new 15% corporate minimum tax, based on adjusted financial statement income of certain large corporations. applicable corporations would be allowed to claim a credit for the minimum tax paid against regular tax in future years. the minimum tax may impact our financial results starting in fiscal 2024. we will evaluate the effect of the corporate minimum tax as more guidance becomes available. the inflation reduction act also includes an excise tax that imposes a 1% surcharge on stock repurchases. this excise tax was effective january 1, 2023. the excise tax is included in our direct cost of stock repurchases and is recorded in equity. we do not expect the excise tax to have a significant impact on our financial results.
although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above, our management believes that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. for further details regarding our operating, investing and financing activities, see the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report.
for details on standby letters of credit, guarantee instruments and other agreements with banks, see off-balance sheet arrangements below.
contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements we have certain on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet obligation arrangements to make future payments under various contracts. certain contractual arrangements which are recorded on our balance sheet include borrowing facilities and debts and lease obligations.
borrowing facilities and debt obligations as of october 29, 2023, we had $5.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes with varying maturities. future interest payments associated with these unsecured notes were $2.8 billion, of which $205 million is due within 12 months and the remaining interest payments are due beyond 12 months. see note 10, borrowing facilities and debt, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion related to our borrowing facilities and debt obligations.
lease obligations as of october 29, 2023, our operating lease obligation was $370 million related to various operating lease arrangements for certain facilities and equipment and our finance lease obligation was $106 million related to lease arrangements that contain a purchase option which we are reasonably certain to exercise at the end of the lease term. see note 11, leases, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion relating to these lease obligations.
purchase obligations as of october 29, 2023, we had $5.5 billion of purchase obligations for goods and services, of which $5.1 billion is payable within 12 months and the remaining amount is payable beyond 12 months.
deemed repatriation tax payable as of october 29, 2023, we had $612 million of transition tax liability, of which $153 million is payable within 12 months and the remaining amount is payable beyond 12 months. this transition tax liability is associated with the deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings as a result of the enactment of the tax act.
other long-term liabilities we also have the obligation to fund our pension, postretirement and deferred compensation plans. we evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans after considering the funded status of the plans, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. payments to the plans would be dependent on these factors and could vary across a wide range of amounts and time periods. payments for deferred compensation plans are dependent on activity by participants, making the timing of payments uncertain. information on our pension, postretirement benefit and deferred compensation plans is presented in note 13, employee benefit plans, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
as of october 29, 2023, the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits that was not expected to result in payment of cash within one year was $511 million. interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions that were not expected to result in payment of cash within one year of october 29, 2023 was $136 million. at this time, we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.
off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either us or our subsidiaries. these include agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft arrangements. we also have agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft arrangements, issuance of bank guarantees, and letters of credit. see note 15, warranty, guarantees, commitments and contingencies, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion relating to these arrangements.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies.
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. specifically, these policies have the following attributes: (1) we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and (2) different estimates we could reasonably have used, or change in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. these estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known. in addition, management is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within our control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time. these uncertainties include those discussed in part i, item 1a, "risk factors." based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that our consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, and provide a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operations.
management believes that the following are critical accounting policies and estimates:
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when promised goods or services (performance obligations) are transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. we perform the following five steps to determine when to recognize revenue: (1) identification of the contract(s) with customers, (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determination of the transaction price, (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied. management uses judgment to identify performance obligations within a contract and to determine whether multiple promised goods or services in a contract should be accounted for separately or as a group. judgment is also used in interpreting commercial terms and determining when transfer of control occurs. moreover, judgment is used to estimate the contract's transaction price and allocate it to each performance obligation. any material changes in the identification of performance obligations, determination and allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations, and determination of when transfer of control occurs to the customer, could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
inventory valuation inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out (fifo) basis. the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand. we evaluate the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand. in addition, inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated, additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
income taxes our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are affected by the geographical composition of pre-tax income which includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates, conditional reduced tax rates and other income tax incentives. it is also affected by events that are not consistent from period to period, such as changes to income tax laws and the resolution of prior years' income tax filings.
we recognize a current tax liability for the estimated amount of income tax payable on tax returns for the current fiscal year. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets are also recognized for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance to the extent it is more likely than not that they are not expected to be realized. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on enacted tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the assets are realized or the liabilities are settled. deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effect of a change in tax rates, laws, or status when the change is enacted.
we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized from such positions are estimated based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. any changes in judgment related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in our provision for income taxes in the quarter in which such change occurs. interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in our provision for income taxes.
the calculation of our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.

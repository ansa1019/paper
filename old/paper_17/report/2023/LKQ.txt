item 1a. risk factors the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10-k should be carefully considered. the occurrence of any of the following risks or of unknown risks and uncertainties may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
risks relating to our business our operating results and financial condition have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the economic, political and social conditions in north america, europe, taiwan and other countries, as well as the economic health of vehicle owners and numbers and types of vehicles sold.
changes in economic, political and social conditions in north america, europe, taiwan and other countries in which we are located or do business could have a material effect on our company. negative effects to our supply chain, costs of doing business, sales and distribution activity may occur due to factors such as war or threats of war, natural disasters, nuclear facility accidents, public health emergencies, major logistics disruptions, sanctions, utility interruptions, terrorism and social unrest.
our business is also affected by a number of other factors. for example, the number and types of new vehicles produced and sold by oem affects our business. a decrease in the number of vehicles on the road may result in a decrease in repairs. in addition, our sales are impacted by changes to the economic health of vehicle owners. the economic health of vehicle owners is affected by many factors, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, taxation, fuel prices, new and used vehicle pricing, unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. many of these factors are outside of our control. if inflationary pressures or any of these other conditions worsen, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.
in addition, economic conditions, including decreased access to credit, may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers, suppliers, logistics and other service providers and financial institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities and hedge transactions. these unfavorable events affecting our business partners could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
we have a substantial business presence in europe, including a significant presence in the u.k. and the republic of ireland ("roi"). the u.k.'s withdrawal from the european union (also known as brexit) became effective on january 31, 2020. while a trade and cooperation agreement exists between the u.k. and european union, we have and continue to observe shipment delays, particularly with respect to the products we supply to our business in the roi. the long-term extent and impact of these issues still remains unclear at this point which could have adverse impacts on our business.
we also have a presence in the ukraine and are monitoring the situation there carefully. in addition, a number of our suppliers are based in china and taiwan and so increasing strains and any political repercussions may have implications upon our supply chain.
although we do not have significant customers or suppliers in the middle east region, we do have customers and suppliers in regions that may be affected. further escalation of the israel and hamas conflict and related geopolitical tensions, including the crisis in the red sea and increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade, could result in, among other things, supply disruptions, lower consumer demand, and changes to foreign exchange rates and financial markets, any of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we face competition from local, national, international, and internet-based vehicle products providers, and this competition could negatively affect our business.
the vehicle replacement products industry and vehicle accessory parts industry are highly competitive and are served by numerous suppliers of oem, recycled, aftermarket, refurbished and remanufactured products. within each of these categories of suppliers, there are local owner-operated companies, larger regional suppliers, national and international providers, and internet-based suppliers and distributors. providers of vehicle replacement and accessory products that have traditionally sold only certain categories of such products may decide to expand their product offerings into other categories of vehicle products, which may further increase competition. some of our current and potential competitors may have more operational expertise; greater financial, technical, manufacturing, distribution, and other resources; longer operating histories; lower cost structures; and better relationships in the insurance and vehicle repair industries or with consumers, than we do. business transacted on online marketplaces continues to increase, which presents additional competitive pressures on us; in addition, the owners of these online marketplaces control access to their platforms and may prohibit us from participating.
in north america and europe, local companies have formed cooperative efforts to compete in our industry. as a result of these factors, our competitors may be able to provide products that we are unable to supply, provide their products at lower costs, or supply products to customers that we are unable to serve.
we believe that a majority of collision parts by dollar amount are supplied by the oems, with the balance being supplied by distributors of alternative aftermarket, recycled, refurbished and remanufactured collision parts like us. the oems are therefore able to exert pricing pressure in the marketplace. we compete with the oems primarily on price and, to a lesser extent, on service and quality. our operations worldwide are dependent upon clear laws and regulation regarding the manufacture of automotive parts in competition with oem parts.
from time to time, the oems have engaged in efforts seeking to increase oem market share and to restrict consumers' choice to use recycled or aftermarket parts to repair consumers' vehicles. examples of these efforts include blocking the use of vehicle telematics by the independent repair industry, demanding that suppliers provide certain parts exclusively to the oems, embedding software in certain vehicle parts that prevents them from being recycled and used to repair other vehicles, repair shop certification programs that, in some cases, require the repair shops to use only oem parts, refusing to sell certain oem parts unless the buyer is an oem-certified shop, obtaining patents and trademarks on various subcomponents of vehicles to prohibit the use of an aftermarket part alternative, and price matching and rebate programs on certain aftermarket products. see the risk factor entitled "intellectual property claims relating to aftermarket products could adversely affect our business." for further information about the oem patents and trademarks.
with respect to telematics, vehicles are increasingly being equipped with systems that transmit data to the oems wirelessly regarding, among other items, accident incidents, maintenance requirements, location of the vehicle, identification of the closest dealership, and other statistics about the vehicle and its driving history. to the extent that this data is not shared with alternative suppliers, the oems will have an advantage with respect to such matters as contacting the vehicle driver, recommending repairs and maintenance, and directing the vehicle owner to an affiliated dealership.
the frequency and intensity of these oem efforts has been increasing over time. the growth and effectiveness of these efforts or the introduction of new ones could have a material adverse effect on our business.
we rely upon insurance companies and our customers to promote the usage of alternative parts.
we rely on business relationships with insurance companies and our customers and our success depends, in part, on the acceptance and promotion of alternative parts usage by automotive insurance companies and vehicle repair facilities. there can be no assurance that current levels of alternative parts usage will be maintained or will increase in the future.
these insurance companies encourage vehicle repair facilities to use products we provide. the business relationships include in some cases participation in aftermarket quality and service assurance programs that may result in a higher usage of our aftermarket products than would be the case without the programs. our arrangements with these companies may be terminated by them at any time, including in connection with their own business concerns relating to the offering, availability, standards or operations of the aftermarket quality and service assurance programs. we rely on these relationships for sales to some repair shops, and a modification or termination of these relationships may result in a loss of sales, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
in addition, to the extent that the repair industry continues to consolidate, the buying power of repair shop customers may further increase, putting additional pressure on our financial returns.
intellectual property claims relating to aftermarket products could adversely affect our business.
oems and others have attempted to use claims of intellectual property infringement against manufacturers and distributors of aftermarket products to restrict or eliminate the sale of aftermarket products that are the subject of the claims. oems have brought such claims in court and with the u.s. international trade commission. in some cases, we have entered into patent license agreements with oems that allow us to sell aftermarket parts that replicate the patented protected parts in exchange for a royalty and otherwise in accordance with the terms of the agreements.
to the extent oems and other manufacturers obtain design patents or trademarks and are successful in asserting claims of infringement of these patents or trademarks against us, we could be restricted or prohibited from selling certain aftermarket products, which could have an adverse effect on our business. in the event that our license agreements, or other similar license arrangements with oems or others, are terminated or we are unable to agree upon renewal terms, we may be subject to costs and uncertainties of litigation as well as restrictions on our ability to sell aftermarket parts that replicate parts covered by those design patents or trademarks. we have filed, and may file in the future, challenges to oem patents, including patents owned by oems with which we have patent license agreements. we also may file challenges to oem trademarks. to the extent oems are successful in defending their patents or trademarks, we could be restricted or prohibited from selling the corresponding aftermarket products, which could have an adverse effect on our business. also, we will likely incur expenses investigating, pursuing and defending intellectual property claims.
u.s. customs and border protection has taken the position that certain of our aftermarket parts infringe certain oem trademarks and seized our aftermarket parts as we attempted to import them into the u.s. we have incurred costs and expenses convincing customs and border protection to release the seized goods and in litigation where we sought a determination of non-infringement. in the event customs and border protection seizes our products again in the future, we may be unsuccessful in obtaining their release, and such goods may be subject to forfeiture and other penalties, and we would incur legal fees in contesting those seizures.
independent organizations that certify aftermarket products may revoke the certification of products that are the subject of intellectual property disputes. lack of certification may negatively impact us because many major insurance companies recommend or require the use of aftermarket products only if they have been certified by such an organization.
if the number of vehicles involved in accidents or being repaired declines, or the mix of the types of vehicles in the overall vehicle population changes, our business could suffer.
our business depends on vehicle accidents, mechanical failures and routine maintenance for both the demand for repairs using our products and services and the supply of recycled, remanufactured and refurbished parts. in addition, our business is impacted by factors that influence the number and/or severity of accidents and mechanical failures including, but not limited to, the number of vehicles on the road, the number of miles driven, the ages of drivers, the occurrence and severity of certain weather conditions, the congestion of traffic, distracted driving, the use of alcohol or drugs by drivers, the usage rate and effectiveness of accident avoidance systems in new vehicles, the reliability of new oem parts, the condition of roadways and the increase in vehicle speeds. in addition, an increase in fuel prices may cause the number of vehicles on the road, the number of miles driven, and the need for mechanical repairs and maintenance to decline, as motorists seek alternative transportation options. mild weather conditions, particularly during winter months, tend to result in a decrease in vehicle accidents. moreover, legislation banning the use of handheld electronic devices while driving could lead to a decline in accidents.
systems designed to minimize accident frequency and severity are becoming more prevalent and more technologically sophisticated. to the extent oems install or are mandated by law to install accident avoidance systems in their vehicles, the number and severity of accidents could decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
the average number of new vehicles sold annually has fluctuated from year-to-year. periods of decreased sales could result in a reduction in the number of vehicles on the road and consequently fewer vehicles involved in accidents or in need of mechanical repair or maintenance. substantial declines in automotive sales in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. in addition, if vehicle population trends result in a disproportionately high number of older vehicles on the road, insurance companies may find it uneconomical to repair such vehicles or there could be less costly repairs. if vehicle population trends result in a disproportionately high number of newer vehicles on the road, the demand generally for mechanical repairs and maintenance would likely decline due to the newer, longer-lasting parts in the vehicle population and mechanical failures being covered by oem warranties for the first years of a vehicle's life. moreover, alternative collision and mechanical parts are less likely to be used on newer vehicles. our specialty segment depends on sales of pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles, crossover utility vehicles, high performance vehicles, marine vehicles and rvs; any reduction in the number of such vehicles in operation will adversely affect demand for our specialty products.
electric vehicles do not have traditional engines, transmissions, and certain related parts. engines and transmissions represent some of our largest revenue generating skus in north america, and parts for engines and transmissions represent a significant amount of the revenue of our european operations. thus, an increase in electric vehicles as a percentage of vehicles sold could have a negative impact on our sales of engines, transmissions, and other related parts.
fluctuations in the prices of commodities could adversely affect our financial results.
our recycling operations generate scrap metal and precious metals (such as platinum, palladium, and rhodium) as well as other metals that we sell. after we dismantle or process a vehicle, the remaining vehicle hulks are sold to scrap processors and other remaining metals are sold to processors and brokers of metals. in addition, we receive "crush only" vehicles or vehicles to be further processed from other companies, including oems, which we dismantle and which generate scrap metal and other metals, in accordance with the guidelines of our agreements with the providing company. the prices of scrap and other metals have historically fluctuated, sometimes significantly, due to market factors. in addition, buyers may stop purchasing metals entirely due to excess supply. to the extent that the prices of metals decrease materially or buyers stop purchasing metals, our revenue from such sales will suffer and a write-down of our inventory value could be required.
the cost of our self service retail and, to a lesser extent, our wholesale recycled inventory purchases will change as a result of fluctuating scrap metal and other metals prices. in a period of falling metal prices, there can be no assurance that our inventory purchasing cost will decrease the same amount or at the same rate as the scrap metal and other metals prices decline, and there may be a delay between the scrap metal and other metals price reductions and any inventory cost reductions. the prices of steel, aluminum, and plastics are components of the cost to manufacture products for our aftermarket business. if the prices of commodities rise and result in higher costs to us for products we sell, we may not be able to pass these higher costs on to our customers.
an adverse change in our relationships with our suppliers, disruption to our supply of inventory, or the misconduct, performance failures or negligence of our third party vendors or service providers could increase our expenses, impede our ability to serve our customers, or expose us to liability.
our wholesale - north america business is dependent on a relatively small number of suppliers of aftermarket products, a large portion of which are sourced from taiwan. our european business acquires products from a wide variety of suppliers, including products from asian sources. we incur substantial freight costs to import parts from our suppliers, many of which are located in asia. the cost of freight and shipping containers rose in 2021 and 2022 relative to historical levels, and if the cost of freight and shipping containers rise again in the future, we might not be able to pass the cost increases on to our customers. furthermore, although alternative suppliers exist for substantially all aftermarket products distributed by us, the loss of any one supplier could have an adverse effect on us until alternative suppliers are located and have commenced manufacturing and providing the relevant products. in addition, we are subject to disruptions from work stoppages and other labor disputes at port facilities through which we import our inventory. we also face the risk that our suppliers could attempt to circumvent us and sell their product directly to our customers; consolidation of our suppliers could enhance their ability to distribute products through additional sales channels and thus decrease their reliance on wholesale distributors like us.
moreover, our operations are subject to the customary risks of doing business abroad, including, among other things, natural disasters, transportation costs and delays, political instability, currency fluctuations and the imposition of tariffs, import and export controls and other non-tariff barriers (including changes in the allocation of quotas).
because a substantial volume of our sales involves products manufactured from sheet metal, we can be adversely impacted if sheet metal becomes unavailable or is only available at higher prices, which we may not be able to pass on to our customers. in addition, as oems convert to raw materials other than steel, it may be more difficult or expensive to source aftermarket parts made with such materials, and it may be more difficult for repair shops to work with such materials in the repair process.
most of our wholesale recycled and a portion of our self service inventory is obtained from vehicles offered at salvage auctions that are owned and operated by third-party companies. we do not typically have contracts with these auction companies. according to industry analysts, a small number of companies control a large percentage of the salvage auction market. if an auction company prohibited us from participating in its auctions, began competing with us, or significantly raised its fees, our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers. moreover, we face competition in the purchase of vehicles from direct competitors, rebuilders, exporters and other bidders. to the extent that the number of bidders increases, it may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold for wholesale recycled products. some jurisdictions regulate bidders to help ensure that salvage vehicles are purchased for legal purposes by qualified buyers. auction companies have been actively seeking to reduce, circumvent or eliminate these regulations, which would further increase the number of bidders.
in addition, there is a limited supply of salvage vehicles in north america, and thus the costs to us of these vehicles could increase over time. in some states, when a vehicle is deemed a total loss, a salvage title is issued. whether states issue salvage titles is important to the supply of inventory for the vehicle recycling industry because an increase in vehicles that qualify as salvage vehicles provides greater availability and typically lowers the price of such vehicles. currently, these titling issues are a matter of state law. the vehicle recycling industry generally favors a uniform definition, since it would avoid inconsistencies across state lines, and generally favors a definition that expands the number of damaged vehicles that qualify as salvage. however, certain interest groups, including repair shops and some insurance associations, may oppose this type of legislation. there can be no assurance that such legislation will be enacted in the future.
we also acquire inventory directly from insurance companies, oems, and others. to the extent that these suppliers decide to discontinue these arrangements, our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers.
as vehicle technology changes, some parts will become more complex and the design or technology of those parts may be covered by patents, proprietary software, access restrictions or other rights that make it difficult for manufacturers to supply such aftermarket parts to companies such as ours. the complexity of the parts may include software or other technical aspects that make it difficult to identify what is wrong with the vehicle. more complex parts may be difficult to repair and may require expensive or difficult to obtain software updates, limiting our ability to compete with the oems.
we rely on third parties to provide products and services that are integral to our operations. if we fail to adequately assess, monitor and regulate the performance of our third-party vendors and service providers, we could be subject to additional risk caused by the misconduct, performance failures or negligence of these third parties. for example, these could include violations of, or noncompliance with, laws and/or regulations governing our business (including, but not limited to, anti-slavery, bribery, child labor, cybersecurity or privacy laws), which could lead to sanctions and/or fines from governmental agencies. our arrangements with third-party vendors and service providers may cause us financial and reputational harm if those third parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us, including their obligations to maintain and protect the security and confidentiality of our information and data or the information and data relating to our customers. see the risk factor entitled "the costs of complying with the requirements of laws pertaining to the privacy and security of personal information and the potential liability associated with the failure to comply with such laws could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations" for further information about the security and confidentiality of our information and data. further, noncompliance with contract terms by our third party vendors or service providers could expose us to liability to other third parties or our employees.
future public health emergencies could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, financial condition and liquidity, the nature and extent of which is highly uncertain.
the global outbreak of the coronavirus ("covid-19") significantly increased economic, demand and operational uncertainty. our operations have generally stabilized since the peak of the covid-19 pandemic, and, in may 2023, the world health organization declared an end to covid-19 as a public health emergency. however, a resurgence or development of new strains of covid-19 or any other public health emergencies could result in unpredictable responses by authorities around the world which could negatively impact our global operations, customers and suppliers. any future pandemics or public health emergencies could reduce demand for our products and/or result in disruptions to our operations, including higher rates of employee absenteeism, and supply chain challenges, which could negatively impact our ability to meet customer demand. the extent to which new strains or variants of covid-19 or other public health emergencies could impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity is highly uncertain and would depend on future developments, including the spread and duration of any such virus and the variants thereof, potential actions taken by governmental authorities and how quickly economic conditions stabilize and recover.
if we determine that our goodwill or other intangible assets have become impaired, we may incur significant charges to our pretax income.
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. in the future, our goodwill and intangible assets may increase as a result of acquisitions. goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of acquired businesses, deterioration of expected future cash flows or performance, increases in our cost of capital, adverse market conditions, and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including modifications that restrict the activities of the acquired business. as of december 31, 2023, our total goodwill subject to future impairment testing was $5,600 million. for further discussion of our annual impairment test, see "goodwill impairment" in the critical accounting estimates section of part ii, item 7 and "intangible assets" in note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
except for indefinite-lived intangibles, we amortize other intangible assets over the assigned useful lives, each of which is based upon the expected period to be benefited. we review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. we review finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. in the event conditions change that affect our ability to realize the underlying cash flows associated with our intangible assets, we may record an impairment charge. as of december 31, 2023, the value of our other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, was $1,313 million.
we could be subject to product liability claims and involved in product recalls.
if our products cause injury or property damage, we could be subject to product liability claims. the successful assertion of this type of claim could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. in addition, we may become involved in the recall of a product that is determined to be defective. more generally, a recall involving alternative parts, even if we did not sell the recalled products, could adversely affect the perceived quality of alternative parts, leading to decreased usage of alternative parts. the expenses of a recall and the damage to our reputation, or the reputation of alternative parts generally, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
in certain circumstances, we have agreed to defend and indemnify insurance companies and customers against claims and damages relating to product liability and product recalls. the existence of claims or damages for which we must defend and indemnify these parties could also negatively impact our business, results of operations or financial condition.
we may not be able to successfully acquire businesses or integrate acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully divest certain businesses.
we may not be able to successfully complete potential strategic acquisitions if we cannot reach agreement on acceptable terms, if we do not obtain required antitrust or other regulatory approvals, or for other reasons. moreover, we may not be able to identify acquisition candidates at reasonable prices and/or be able to successfully integrate acquisitions.
if we buy a business or a division of a business, we may experience difficulty integrating that business' or division's personnel and operations, which could negatively affect our operating results. in addition:
•the key personnel of the acquired business may decide not to work for us;
•customers of the acquired business may decide not to purchase products from us;
•suppliers of the acquired business may decide not to sell products to us;
•we may experience business disruptions as a result of it systems conversions;
•we may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, and financial reporting;
•we may be held liable for environmental, tax or other risks and liabilities as a result of our acquisitions, some of which we may not have discovered during our due diligence;
•we may intentionally assume the liabilities of the businesses we acquire, which could result in material adverse effects on our business;
•the acquired business could place unanticipated demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems;
•our existing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention;
•we may not be able to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated, either in the amount or in the time frame that we expect; and
•we may incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisition, the issuance of which could involve the imposition of restrictive covenants or be dilutive to our existing stockholders.
for example, we have undertaken the 1 lkq europe program to create structural centralization and standardization of key functions to facilitate the operation of the europe segment as a single business; this program has presented and will continue to present a number of execution challenges.
in addition to acquisitions, we have divested, and will continue to divest, certain businesses, either because they do not meet our performance standards or for other reasons. as a result of a divestment, we may not recover the carrying value of our investment in the divested business; in addition, such divestment transactions require significant management time and attention.
risks relating to our financial structure we have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to obtain financing in the future and to react to changes in our business.
as of december 31, 2023, we had approximately $1,943 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured, variable-rate debt outstanding under our senior unsecured credit agreement and senior unsecured term loan agreement and approximately $976 million of availability under the senior unsecured credit agreement ($1,086 million of availability reduced by $110 million of amounts outstanding under letters of credit). in addition, we had approximately $2,228 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured, fixed rate debt outstanding comprised of €500 million ($552 million) aggregate principal amount of 3.875% senior notes due 2024 (the "euro notes (2024)"), €250 million ($276 million) of 4.125% senior notes due 2028 (the "euro notes (2028)"), $800 million of 5.75% senior notes due 2028 (the "u.s. notes (2028)"), and $600 million of 6.25% senior notes due 2033 (the "u.s. notes (2033)," and together with the euro notes (2024), the euro notes (2028), and the u.s. notes (2028), the "senior notes").
our substantial amount of debt and our debt service obligations could limit our ability to satisfy our obligations, limit our ability to operate our business and impair our competitive position.
for example, our debt and our debt service obligations could:
•increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and general industry conditions, including interest rate fluctuations, because a portion of our borrowings are and will continue to be at variable rates of interest;
•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, other investments or other general corporate purposes;
•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry;
•place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that may have proportionately less debt;
•limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing due to applicable financial and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements; and
•increase our cost of borrowing.
in addition, if we or our subsidiaries incur additional debt, the risks associated with our substantial leverage and the ability to service such debt would increase.
our senior notes do not impose any limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or protect against certain other types of transactions, and we may incur additional indebtedness under our credit agreement.
although we are subject to our credit agreement for so long as it remains in effect, the indentures governing the senior notes do not restrict the future incurrence of unsecured indebtedness, guarantees or other obligations. the indentures contain certain limitations on our ability to incur liens on assets and engage in sale and leaseback transactions. however, these limitations are subject to important exceptions. in addition, the indentures do not contain many other restrictions, including certain restrictions contained in our credit agreement, including, without limitation, making investments, prepaying subordinated indebtedness or engaging in transactions with our affiliates.
our credit agreement will permit, subject to specified conditions and limitations, the incurrence of a significant amount of additional indebtedness under the existing agreement. as of december 31, 2023, we would have been able to incur an additional $976 million of indebtedness under our credit agreement ($1,086 million of availability reduced by $110 million of amounts outstanding under letters of credit). if we or our subsidiaries incur additional debt, the risks associated with our substantial leverage and the need to service such debt would increase.
our credit agreement imposes operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities.
our credit agreement imposes operating and financial restrictions on us. these restrictions may limit our ability, among other things, to:
•incur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness (including guarantees thereof) outside of our credit agreement;
•incur liens on assets;
•engage in transactions with affiliates;
•sell certain assets or merge or consolidate with or into other companies;
•guarantee indebtedness; and
•alter the business we conduct.
as a result of these covenants and restrictions, we may be limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. in the event we fail to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future, we may be unable to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants. failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under the credit agreement. a default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of our debt, in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable. if this occurs, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. even if new financing were available, it may be on terms that are less attractive to us than our existing credit facilities or it may be on terms that are not acceptable to us.
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.
our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. we cannot guarantee that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. if our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we hope to realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. any future refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations.
our future capital needs may require that we seek to refinance our debt or obtain additional debt or equity financing, events that could have a negative effect on our business.
we may need to raise additional funds in the future to, among other things, refinance existing debt, fund our existing operations, improve or expand our operations, respond to competitive pressures, or make acquisitions. from time to time, we may raise additional funds through public or private financing, strategic alliances, or other arrangements. funds may not be available or available on terms acceptable to us as a result of different factors, including but not limited to turmoil in the credit markets that results in the tightening of credit conditions and current or future regulations applicable to the financial institutions from which we seek financing. if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to meet our business or strategic objectives or compete effectively. if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests, and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of our common stock. if we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to higher borrowing costs and further limitations on our operations. if we refinance or restructure our debt, we may incur charges to write off the unamortized portion of deferred debt issuance costs from a previous financing, or we may incur charges related to hedge ineffectiveness from our interest rate swap obligations. there are limitations in the indentures that govern the u.s. notes (2028) and u.s. notes (2033) on our ability to refinance such notes prior to may 15, 2028 and march 15, 2033, respectively. we could refinance the senior notes through open market purchases, subject to a limitation in our credit agreement on the amount of such purchases. if we fail to raise capital when needed, our business may be negatively affected.
our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our indebtedness service obligations to increase significantly.
borrowings under our credit agreement are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. if interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. moreover, changes in market interest rates could affect the trading value of the senior notes.
repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries.
we are a holding company and repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. unless they are borrowers or guarantors of the indebtedness, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. our subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the senior notes. each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries and, under certain circumstances, distributions from our subsidiaries may be subject to taxes that reduce the amount of such distributions available to us. while the indentures governing the senior notes limit the ability of our subsidiaries to restrict the payment of dividends or to restrict other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. in the event that we do not receive sufficient distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the senior notes.
a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital.
credit ratings have an important effect on our cost of capital. credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include, among other items, our results of operations, business decisions that we make, their view of the general outlook for our industry, and their view of the general outlook for the economy. actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining, upgrading, or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading. we believe our current credit ratings enhance our ability to borrow funds at favorable rates. a downgrade in our current credit rating from a rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our credit facilities. a downgrade could also adversely affect our ability to issue debt securities in the future or incur other indebtedness upon favorable terms. if we are downgraded to a rating that is below investment grade, we may also become subject to additional covenants under our senior notes.
the amount and frequency of our share repurchases and dividend payments may fluctuate.
the amount, timing and execution of our share repurchase program may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes such as operational spending, capital spending, acquisitions or repayment of debt. changes in cash flows, tax laws and our share price could also impact our share repurchase program and other capital activities. in addition, decisions to return capital to shareholders, including through our repurchase program or the issuance of dividends on our common stock, remain subject to determination of our board that any such activity is in the best interests of our shareholders and is in compliance with all applicable laws and contractual obligations.
legal and regulatory risks existing or new laws and regulations, or changes to enforcement or interpretation of existing laws or regulations, may prohibit, restrict or burden the sale of aftermarket, recycled, refurbished or remanufactured products.
many states have introduced or passed laws that limit the use of aftermarket products in collision repair. these laws include requirements relating to consumer disclosure, vehicle owner's consent regarding the use of aftermarket products in the repair process, and the requirement to have aftermarket products certified by an independent testing organization. additional legislation of this kind may be introduced in the future. if additional laws prohibiting or restricting the use of aftermarket products are passed, it could have an adverse impact on our aftermarket products business.
certain independent organizations test the quality and safety of aftermarket products. if these organizations decide not to test a particular aftermarket product, or in the event that such organizations decide that a particular product does not meet applicable quality or safety standards, we may decide to discontinue sales of such product or insurance companies may decide to discontinue authorization of repairs using such product. such events could adversely affect our business.
some jurisdictions have enacted laws prohibiting or severely restricting the sale of certain recycled products that we provide, such as airbags. in addition, laws relating to the regulation of parts affecting vehicle emissions, such as california's proposition 65, may impact the ability of our specialty segment to sell certain accessory products. these and other jurisdictions could enact similar laws or could prohibit or severely restrict the sale of additional recycled products. the passage of legislation with prohibitions or restrictions that are more severe than current laws could have a material adverse effect on our business. in addition, congress could enact federal legislation restricting the use of aftermarket or recycled automotive products used in the course of vehicle repairs.
in europe, the motor vehicle block exemption regulations ("mvber") regulate the competition rules on automotive spare parts. in april 2023, the mvber was extended for 5 years. the mvber and accompanying guidance clarified that data generated by vehicle sensors may be an 'essential input' for the provision of repair and maintenance services. therefore, independent repairers should have access to such data on an equal footing to oem authorized dealers. the existing principles for the provision of technical information, tools and training necessary for the repair and maintenance services have also been extended to explicitly cover vehicle-generated data. a similar regulation has also been adopted in the u.k. under the motor vehicle block exemption order, which addresses technological and data requirements and remains in force until may 31, 2029.
the federal trade commission has issued guides that regulate the use of certain terms such as "rebuilt" or "remanufactured" in connection with the sale of automotive parts. restrictions on the products we are able to sell and on the marketing of such products could decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and operations.
we are subject to environmental regulations and incur costs relating to environmental matters.
we are subject to various environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things: the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air, or water; exposure to hazardous materials; and the generation, handling, storage, use, treatment, identification, transportation, and disposal of industrial by-products, waste water, storm water, and mercury and other hazardous materials. we are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. if we violate or fail to obtain or comply with these laws, regulations, or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators or lose our operating permits. we could also become liable if employees or other parties are improperly exposed to hazardous materials. we have an environmental management process designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements; however, we cannot guarantee complete compliance with such requirements.
we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures relating to environmental matters. although we presently do not expect to incur any capital or other expenditures relating to environmental controls or other environmental matters in amounts that would be material to us, we may be required to make such expenditures in the future.
under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at, or migration to or from, our present facilities or our predecessors' past facilities and at independent waste disposal sites. these laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. some of our facilities are located on or near properties with a history of industrial use that may have involved hazardous materials. as a result, some of our properties may be contaminated. some environmental laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination. these environmental laws also impose liability on any person who disposes of, treats, or arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances, regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person, and at times can impose liability on companies deemed under law to be a successor to such person. third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties, or successors to such owners or operators, for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances.
contamination resulting from the vehicle recycling processes can include soil and ground water contamination from the release, storage, transportation, or disposal of gasoline, motor oil, antifreeze, transmission fluid, chlorofluorocarbons from air conditioners, other hazardous materials, or metals such as aluminum, cadmium, chromium, lead, and mercury. contamination from the refurbishment of chrome plated bumpers can occur from the release of the plating material. contamination can migrate on-site or off-site, which can increase the risk, and the amount, of any potential liability.
when we identify a potential material environmental issue during our acquisition due diligence process, we analyze the risks, and, when appropriate, perform further environmental assessment to verify and quantify the extent of the potential contamination. furthermore, where appropriate, we have established financial reserves for certain environmental matters. in the event we discover new information or if laws change, we may incur significant liabilities, which may exceed our reserves.
environmental laws are complex, change frequently, and have tended to become more stringent over time. our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be negatively impacted, which could harm our operating results and investor perceptions of our company and as a result may have a material adverse effect on the value of our common stock.
pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and related rules, our management is required to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. the rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing, and, in some instances, remediation. we have acquired entities that had no publicly traded debt or equity and therefore were not previously required to conform to the rules and regulations of the sec, especially related to their internal control structure. integrating acquired entities into our internal control over financial reporting has required and will continue to require significant time and resources from our management and other personnel, which increases our compliance costs. we must complete the evaluation and integration of internal controls over financial reporting and report our assessment within the required time frame.
in addition, with the increasing frequency of cyber-related frauds perpetrated to obtain inappropriate payments, we need to ensure our internal controls related to authorizing the transfer of funds and changing our vendor master files are adequate. furthermore, the introduction of new, and changes to existing, erp and financial reporting information systems create implementation and change management risks that require effective internal controls to mitigate. failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to accurately report our financial results, the market's perception of our business, and our stock price.
we may be adversely affected by legal, regulatory or market responses to global climate change.
growing concern over climate change has led policy makers to enact or consider the enactment of legislative and regulatory proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on greenhouse gas emissions. such laws, if enacted, are likely to impact our business in a number of ways. for example, significant increases in fuel economy requirements, new regulatory restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or new incentive programs that may be imposed on vehicles and automobile fuels could adversely affect demand for vehicles, annual miles driven or the products we sell. we may not be able to accurately predict, prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations with respect to electric vehicles and other technologies that minimize emissions. compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws, could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers. our inability to appropriately respond to such changes could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
moreover, the perspectives of our customers, suppliers, stockholders, employees, community partners, regulatory agencies and other stakeholders regarding climate change are evolving. these stakeholders are increasingly requesting disclosures and actions relating to not only climate change but other environmental and social matters and corporate governance practices. the increase in costs to comply with such evolving expectations, including any rules or regulations resulting from these evolving expectations, as well as any risk of noncompliance, could adversely impact us.
our amended and restated bylaws provide that the courts in the state of delaware are the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.
our amended and restated bylaws provide that the court of chancery of the state of delaware (or if the court of chancery does not have jurisdiction, another court of the state of delaware, or if no court of the state of delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the district of delaware) shall be the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings:
•any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;
•any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;
•any action asserting a claim against us arising under the delaware general corporation law, our certificate of incorporation, or our bylaws;
•any action asserting a claim governed by the internal-affairs doctrine; and
•any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws.
the choice of forum provision in our bylaws does not apply to claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the exchange act or the securities act or any claim with respect to which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.
although we believe this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers due to, among other possible factors, increased costs of such lawsuits and limitations on the ability to bring claims in a judicial forum that the plaintiffs may consider more favorable. alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
our effective tax rate could materially increase as a consequence of various factors, including u.s. and/or international tax legislation, applicable interpretations and administrative guidance, our mix of earnings by jurisdiction, and u.s. and foreign jurisdictional audits.
we are a u.s. based multinational company subject to income taxes in the u.s. and a number of foreign jurisdictions. therefore, we are subject to changes in tax laws in each of these jurisdictions, and such changes could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate and cash flows.
on august 16, 2022, the u.s. enacted legislation commonly referred to as the inflation reduction act (the "ira"). the ira contained a number of new provisions the most significant of which are a new corporate alternative minimum tax and a new stock repurchase excise tax. in addition, the organization for economic co-operation and development (the "oecd") released a framework, referred to as pillar two, to implement a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% on certain multinational enterprises. certain countries have enacted legislation to adopt the pillar two framework while several countries are considering or still announcing changes to their tax laws to implement the minimum tax directive. while we do not currently expect pillar two to have a material impact on our effective tax rate, our analysis will continue as the oecd continues to release additional guidance and countries implement legislation.
the tax rates applicable in the jurisdictions within which we operate vary. therefore, our effective tax rate may be adversely affected by changes in the mix of our earnings by jurisdiction.
we are also subject to ongoing audits of our income tax returns in various jurisdictions both in the u.s. and internationally. while we believe that our tax positions will be sustained, the outcomes of such audits could result in the assessment of additional taxes, which could adversely impact our cash flows and financial results.
if significant tariffs or other restrictions are placed on products or materials we import or any related counter-measures are taken by countries to which we export products, our revenue and results of operations may be materially harmed.
the u.s. has imposed tariffs on certain materials imported into the u.s. from china and announced additional tariffs on other goods from china and other countries. moreover, counter-measures have been taken by other countries in retaliation for the u.s.-imposed tariffs. the tariffs cover products and materials that we import, and the counter-measures may affect products we export. the effects currently are not material; however, depending on the breadth of products and materials ultimately affected by, and the duration of, the tariffs and countermeasures, our financial results may be materially harmed. in addition, countries may impose other restrictions on the importation of products.
governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our operating licenses and permits.
our operating subsidiaries in our salvage, self service, and refurbishing operations must obtain licenses and permits from state and local governments to conduct their operations. when we develop or acquire a new facility, we must seek the approval of state and local units of government. governmental agencies may resist the establishment of a vehicle recycling or refurbishing facility in their communities. there can be no assurance that future approvals or transfers will be granted. in addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and renew the licenses and permits our operating subsidiaries currently hold.
the costs of complying with the requirements of laws pertaining to data privacy and cybersecurity of personal information and the potential liability associated with the failure to comply with such laws could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
we collect personally identifiable information ("pii") and other data as part of our business processes and operations. the legislative and regulatory framework relating to privacy and data protection is rapidly evolving worldwide and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. this data is subject to a variety of u.s. and international laws and regulations. many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the european union, canada, u.k., switzerland and other jurisdictions where we conduct business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of pii and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions that are more restrictive than those in the u.s. in addition, the european union adopted the general data protection regulation ("gdpr") that imposes more stringent data protection requirements for processors and controllers of personal data, including expanded disclosures about how pii is to be used, limitations on retention of pii, mandatory data breach notification requirements, possible restrictions on cross border transfers of pii and higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. the gdpr provides severe penalties for noncompliance. in addition, stricter laws in this area are being enacted in certain states in the u.s. and in other countries, and more jurisdictions are likely to follow this trend. most recently, the sec has announced strict disclosure rules for material, cybersecurity incidents.
any inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy and data protection issues, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations (including at newly-acquired companies) could result in additional cost and liability to us, result in governmental investigations and enforcement actions, give rise to civil litigation, result in damage to our reputation (including the loss of trust by our customers and employees), inhibit sales, and otherwise adversely affect our business. we also may be subject to these adverse effects if other parties with whom we do business, including lenders, suppliers, consultants and advisors, violate applicable laws or contractual obligations or suffer a security breach.
general risk factors our employees are important to successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives.
our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees at the operating level. if we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees, or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives. if we lose the services of any of our key employees at the operating or regional level, we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel, which could harm our business. in addition, we have experienced wage inflation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. an inability to respond to these inflationary pressures could impact our ability to retain key employees or we may experience increased costs due to difficulties related to hiring and retaining employees.
we operate in foreign jurisdictions, which exposes us to foreign exchange and other risks.
we have operations in north america, europe and taiwan, and we may expand our operations in the countries in which we do business and into other countries. our foreign operations expose us to additional risks associated with international business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition, including import and export requirements and compliance with anti-corruption laws, such as the u.k. bribery act 2010 and the foreign corrupt practices act. we also incur costs in currencies other than our functional currencies in some of the countries in which we operate. we are thus subject to foreign exchange exposure to the extent that we operate in different currencies, as well as exposure to foreign tax and other foreign and domestic laws. in addition, certain countries in which we operate have a higher level of political instability and criminal activity than the u.s. that could affect our operations and the ability to maintain our supply of products.
our business may be adversely affected by union activities and labor and employment laws.
certain of our employees are represented by labor unions and works councils and other employee representative bodies and work under collective bargaining or similar agreements, which are subject to periodic renegotiation. from time to time, there have been efforts to organize additional portions of our workforce and those efforts can be expected to continue. in addition, legislators and government agencies could adopt new regulations, or interpret existing regulations in a manner, that could make it significantly easier for unionization efforts to be successful. also, we have been and may in the future be subject to strikes or work stoppages, union and works council campaigns, and other labor disruptions and disputes. additional unionization efforts, new collective bargaining or similar agreements, and work stoppages could materially increase our costs and reduce revenue and could limit our flexibility in terms of work schedules, reductions in force and other operational matters.
we also are subject to laws and regulations that govern such matters as minimum wage, overtime and other working conditions. some of these laws are technical in nature and could be subject to interpretation by government agencies and courts different than our interpretations. efforts to comply with existing laws, changes to such laws and newly-enacted laws may increase our labor costs and limit our flexibility. if we were found not to be in compliance with such laws, we could be subject to fines, penalties and liabilities to our employees or government agencies. in addition, efforts to better protect local markets from foreign workers and decisions of countries to withdraw from treaties and joint economic areas may lead to increased restrictions on the free movement of people and labor and may limit our ability to place key personnel where they could best serve our needs.
we rely on information technology and communication systems in critical areas of our operations and a disruption relating to such technology could harm our business.
in the ordinary course of business, we rely upon it networks and systems, some of which are provided by or leased from third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities. the secure operation of these it networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy. despite security measures and business continuity plans, these it networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals, breaches due to employee error or malfeasance, disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, terminations of business relationships by third party service providers, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, terrorist acts, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. the occurrence of any of these events involving us or involving the third parties with whom we do business could compromise our or the third parties' networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. any such access, disclosure or loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business. in addition, as security threats continue to evolve, we will likely need to invest additional resources to protect the security of our systems.
in the event that we decide to switch providers or to implement upgrades or replacements to our own systems, we may be unsuccessful in the development of our own systems or we may underestimate the costs and expenses of switching providers or developing and implementing our own systems. also, our revenue may be hampered during the period of implementing an alternative system, which period could extend longer than we anticipated. we are in the midst of a systems conversion project for our european businesses, which will be subject to all of these risks.
business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our operations, the function of our computer systems, and/or the availability and distribution of merchandise, which may affect our business.
weather, terrorist activities, war or other disasters, or the threat of any of them, may result in the breakdown of our distribution center systems, closure of our distribution centers or other facilities or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory through our system on a timely basis. this may affect our ability to serve our customers, resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty. some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the countries in which we operate, and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices. such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
if we experience problems with our fleet of trucks and other vehicles, our business could be harmed.
we use a fleet of trucks and other vehicles to deliver the majority of the products we sell. we are subject to the risks associated with providing delivery services, including inclement weather, disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, governmental regulation, availability and price of fuel, liabilities arising from accidents to the extent we are not covered by insurance, insurance premium increases, and ability to hire drivers. in addition, our failure to deliver products in a timely and accurate manner could harm our reputation and brand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
we may lose the right to operate at key locations.
we lease most of the properties at which we conduct our businesses. at the end of a lease term, we must negotiate a renewal, exercise a purchase option (to the extent we have that right), or find a new location. there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate renewals on terms acceptable to us or that we will find a suitable alternative location, especially with respect to our salvage operations (which have characteristics that are often not attractive to landlords, local governments, or neighbors). in such cases, we may lose the right to operate at key locations.
activist investors could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management's attention, and have an adverse effect on our business.
we have in the past received, and we may in the future be subject to, proposals by activist investors urging us to take certain corporate actions. activist investor activities could cause our business to be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and other demands by activist investors can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, and divert the attention of management and our employees. for example, we have retained, and may in the future be required to retain, the services of various professionals to advise us on activist investor matters, including legal, financial and communications advisors, the costs of which may negatively impact our future financial results. campaigns by activist investors to effect changes at publicly-traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short term investor value through actions such as financial restructuring, increased debt, special dividends, stock repurchases, or sales of assets or the entire company. perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership that arise as a consequence of activist investor initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors, employees and business partners, and cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data," of this annual report on form 10-k. discussion of 2021 items and the year-over-year comparison of changes in our financial condition and the results of operations as of and for the years ended december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021 can be found in part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations," of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2022 filed with the sec on february 23, 2023. unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations," the terms "we," "us," "the company," "our," "lkq" and similar terms refer to lkq corporation and its subsidiaries.
overview we are a global distributor of vehicle products, including replacement parts, components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles, and specialty aftermarket products and accessories to improve the performance, functionality and appearance of vehicles.
buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily five sources: new products produced by oems; new products produced by companies other than the oems, which are referred to as aftermarket products; recycled products obtained from salvage and total loss vehicles; recycled products that have been refurbished; and recycled products that have been remanufactured. we distribute a variety of products to collision and mechanical repair shops, including aftermarket collision and mechanical products; recycled collision and mechanical products; refurbished collision products such as wheels, bumper covers and lights; and remanufactured engines and transmissions. collectively, we refer to the four sources that are not new oem products as alternative parts.
we are organized into four operating segments: wholesale - north america; europe; specialty; and self service, each of which is presented as a reportable segment.
our wholesale - north america segment is a leading provider of alternative vehicle collision replacement products, paint and related products, and alternative vehicle mechanical replacement products, with our sales, processing, and distribution facilities reaching most major markets in the united states and canada. our europe segment is a leading provider of alternative vehicle replacement and maintenance products in germany, the u.k., the benelux region, italy, czech republic, austria, slovakia, poland, and various other european countries. our specialty segment is a leading distributor of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories reaching most major markets in the u.s. and canada. our self service segment operates self service retail facilities across the u.s. that sell recycled automotive products from end-of-life-vehicles.
our operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. please refer to the factors referred to in special note on forward-looking statements and risk factors above. due to these factors and others, which may be unknown to us at this time, our operating results in future periods can be expected to fluctuate. accordingly, our historical results of operations may not be indicative of future performance.
acquisitions and investments since our inception in 1998, we have pursued a growth strategy through both organic growth and acquisitions. through 2018, our acquisition strategy was focused on consolidation to build scale in fragmented markets across north america and europe. we targeted companies that were market leaders, expanded our geographic presence and enhanced our ability to provide a wide array of vehicle products through our distribution network. in the last few years, we have shifted our focus to acquisitions that target high synergies and/or add critical capabilities, including the acquisition of uni-select, completed in august 2023, that complements our existing north american paint distribution operations and provides a scaled position in the canadian mechanical parts space, with opportunity for future consolidation and growth. additionally, we have made investments in various businesses to advance our strategic objectives. see note 3, "business combinations" and note 11, "equity method investments" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information related to our acquisitions and investments.
sources of revenue we report our revenue in two categories: (i) parts and services and (ii) other. our parts revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle products, including replacement parts, components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles, and specialty products and accessories used to improve the performance, functionality and appearance of vehicles. our service revenue is generated primarily from the sale of service-type warranties, fees for admission to our self service yards, and diagnostic and repair services. during the year ended december 31, 2023, parts and services revenue represented 95.0% of our consolidated revenue. revenue from other sources includes scrap and other metals (including precious metals - platinum, palladium and rhodium - contained in recycled parts such as catalytic converters) sales, bulk sales to mechanical manufacturers (including cores) and sales of aluminum ingots and sows from our furnace operations. other revenue will vary from period to period based on fluctuations in commodity prices and the volume of materials sold. see note 13, "revenue recognition" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information related to our sources of revenue.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap") requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. historically, we have not made significant changes to the methods for determining these estimates as our actual results have not differed materially from our estimates. we do not believe it is reasonably likely that the estimates and related assumptions will change materially in the foreseeable future; however, actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.
critical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and which require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below. for additional information related to significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, see note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies" to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
goodwill impairment description goodwill is obtained through business acquisitions and recorded at the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. goodwill is not amortized but instead tested for impairment annually or sooner if events indicate that an impairment may exist. in performing this test, we compare the carrying value of the asset to its fair value. to derive the fair value for our reporting units which carry goodwill, we consider the use of various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being an income approach via a discounted cash flow method and another being a market approach via a guideline public company method. if the carrying value of these assets exceeds the estimated fair value, the asset is considered impaired and an impairment charge is recognized. in performing the test for impairment of goodwill, goodwill is allocated to the reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination.
judgments and uncertainties determining whether impairment indicators exist and estimating fair values as part of impairment testing require significant judgment. estimating the fair values of our reporting units which have goodwill requires the use of significant unobservable inputs, or level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. as part of applying the discounted cash flow method and guideline public company method, we use significant assumptions which include sales growth, operating margins, discount rates, perpetual growth rates and valuation multiples which consider our budgets, business plans, economic projections and marketplace data.
sensitivity of estimate to change the balance of our goodwill was $5,600 million and $4,319 million as of december 31, 2023 and december 31, 2022, respectively. we have not made material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill during the last three years. the assumptions used to assess impairment consider historical trends, macroeconomic conditions, and projections consistent with the company's operating strategy. changes in these estimates can have a significant impact on the assessment of fair value which could result in material impairment losses. during fiscal year 2023, we elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for our goodwill. no impairment charges were recorded as a result of the testing as the fair value of each goodwill reporting unit exceeded the calculated carrying value. a 10% decline in projected cash flows or a 10% increase in the discount rate would not have resulted in an impairment to goodwill.
business combinations description we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, under which the acquisition purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired, including purchased intangible assets, and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values. the excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.
judgments and uncertainties accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in relation to the acquisitions are appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, information obtained from management of the acquired companies and information obtained from independent third party valuation firms and are inherently uncertain. critical estimates in valuing certain acquired intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows including revenue growth rate assumptions from product sales and customer contracts, estimated royalty rates used in valuing related intangible assets, customer attrition rates and discount rates. the discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risks. unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
sensitivity of estimate to change the amount of goodwill recorded from our 2023 acquisitions was $1,221 million as of december 31, 2023. while we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. changes in the estimates applied or values of acquired assets and liabilities could have a material impact on our financial statements. as a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the originally assigned values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill.
recently issued accounting pronouncements see "recent accounting pronouncements" in note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for information related to new accounting standards.
financial information by geographic area see note 13, "revenue recognition" and note 25, "segment and geographic information" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for information related to our revenue and long-lived assets by geographic region.
1 lkq europe plan we have undertaken the 1 lkq europe plan to create structural centralization and standardization of key functions to facilitate the operation of the europe segment as a single business. under this multi-year plan, we expect to recognize the following:
•restructuring expenses - non-recurring costs resulting directly from the implementation of the 1 lkq europe plan from which the business will derive no ongoing benefit. see note 14, "restructuring and transaction related expenses" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further details.
•transformation expenses - period costs incurred to execute the 1 lkq europe plan that are expected to contribute to ongoing benefits to the business (e.g., non-capitalizable implementation costs related to a common erp platform). these expenses are recorded in selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expenses.
•transformation capital expenditures - capitalizable costs for long-lived assets, such as software and facilities, that directly relate to the execution of the 1 lkq europe plan.
costs related to the 1 lkq europe plan are reflected in sg&a expenses, restructuring and transaction related expenses and purchases of property, plant and equipment in our consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
we are executing on the various projects associated with the 1 lkq europe plan and expect to be completed by the end of 2027. in the second quarter of 2023, we extended the completion date from 2025 to 2027 based on a detailed project review, after which we concluded that the common erp system implementation would require additional time to allow for operational process reengineering to support further standardization across the segment. the extended implementation schedule and incremental process reengineering work will help to minimize potential business disruptions but increased the overall cost estimate by $85 million. we expect to achieve additional cost benefits through expanded application of shared services and productivity improvements along with working capital reductions related to inventory rationalization. we are currently realizing a portion of the benefits of the 1 lkq europe plan, and we expect to grow segment ebitda margin in the future as further actions in the plan are implemented. during the year ended december 31, 2023, we incurred $27 million in costs across all three categories noted above. we expect that costs of the plan, reflecting all three categories noted above, will range between $125 million to $155 million for 2024 through the projected plan completion date in 2027. in the future, we may also identify additional initiatives and projects under the 1 lkq europe plan that may result in additional expenditures, although we are currently unable to estimate the range of charges for such potential future initiatives and projects. we expect the plan to continue to enable trade working capital and productivity initiatives that will help fund the plan cost.
ukraine/russia conflict the russian invasion of ukraine and resulting global governmental response impacted our business in 2022 and 2023, and are expected to continue to impact our business in 2024. governmental sanctions imposed on russia have restricted our ability to sell to and collect from customers based in russia and belarus, and russian military activity in ukrainian territory has temporarily changed the way in which we operate in ukraine. many of our branches in ukraine have remained open, although operating at less than full capacity, during the conflict, while others have closed temporarily. we expect to continue operating in this manner unless conditions change. we currently do not expect the conflict to have a material impact on our ongoing results of operations or cash flows. our operations in ukraine represented approximately 1% of both our total annual revenue and total annual operating profit for fiscal year 2023 and comprised approximately $69 million of total assets as of december 31, 2023. in addition, lkq revenue from customers in russia and belarus represented less than 0.3% of our total revenue in 2021 (the last full year before we stopped selling to customers in these countries). as future developments in the conflict are difficult to predict and outside of our control, it is possible that estimates underlying our financial statements may change significantly in future periods.
key performance indicators we believe that organic revenue growth, segment ebitda and free cash flow are key performance indicators for our business. segment ebitda is our key measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. free cash flow is a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("non-gaap").
•organic revenue growth - we define organic revenue growth as total revenue growth from continuing operations excluding the effects of acquisitions and divestitures (i.e., revenue generated from the date of acquisition to the first anniversary of that acquisition, net of reduced revenue due to the disposal of businesses) and foreign currency movements (i.e., impact of translating revenue at different exchange rates). organic revenue growth includes incremental sales from both existing and new (i.e., opened within the last twelve months) locations and is derived from expanding business with existing customers, securing new customers and offering additional products and services. we believe that organic revenue growth is a key performance indicator as this statistic measures our ability to serve and grow our customer base successfully.
•segment ebitda - see note 25, "segment and geographic information" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for a description of the calculation of segment ebitda. we believe that segment ebitda provides useful information to evaluate our segment profitability by focusing on the indicators of ongoing operational results.
•free cash flow - we calculate free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of property, plant and equipment. free cash flow provides insight into our liquidity and provides useful information to management and investors concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase stock, and pay dividends.
these three key performance indicators are used as targets in determining incentive compensation at various levels of the organization, including senior management. by using these performance measures, we attempt to motivate a balanced approach to the business that rewards growth, profitability and cash flow generation in a manner that enhances our long-term prospects.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
the increase in parts and services revenue of 10.4% represented increases in segment revenue of 18.2% in wholesale - north america, 10.4% in europe, and 2.4% in self service, partially offset by a decrease of 6.9% in specialty. this overall increase was driven by organic parts and services revenue growth of 4.7%, a 4.8% increase due to the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, and a 0.9% increase due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. the decrease in other revenue of 19.6% was primarily driven by a decrease in organic revenue of $138 million due to unfavorable movements in precious metals and scrap steel prices compared to the prior year, primarily attributable to a $93 million decrease in our self service segment and a $41 million decrease in our wholesale - north america segment. refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the changes in revenue by segment for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the year ended december 31, 2022.
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue increased to 59.8% for the year ended december 31, 2023 from 59.2% for the year ended december 31, 2022. cost of goods sold reflects increases of 0.4% from our specialty segment, and 0.3% from our wholesale - north america segment (including a 0.5% dilutive effect related to our acquisition of uni-select), partially offset by a decrease of 0.2% attributable to mix primarily due to a decline in revenue in our specialty segment. refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the changes in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue by segment for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the year ended december 31, 2022.
selling, general and administrative expenses our sg&a expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 27.9% for the year ended december 31, 2023 from 27.7% for the year ended december 31, 2022. the year over year change in sg&a expense was mostly impacted by offsetting factors including an unfavorable mix effect, and a reduction in our wholesale - north america segment, which benefited from the uni-select acquisition. refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the changes in sg&a expenses as a percentage of revenue by segment for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the year ended december 31, 2022.

(1)restructuring expenses for the year ended december 31, 2023 primarily consisted of (i) $29 million related to our acquisition integration plans, (ii) $14 million related to our global restructuring plans, and (iii) $1 million related to our 1 lkq europe plan.
(2)    restructuring expenses for the year ended december 31, 2022 primarily consisted of (i) $11 million related to our global restructuring plans, (ii) $3 million related to our acquisition integration plans, and (iii) $1 million related to our 1 lkq europe plan.
(3)    transaction related expenses for the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022 primarily related to external costs such as legal, accounting and advisory fees related to completed and potential acquisitions (including uni-select transaction costs in 2023).

(1)depreciation expense increased primarily related to an increase in capital expenditures, primarily in our europe and wholesale - north america segments, and $3 million from our acquisition of uni-select.
(2)amortization expense increased primarily due to (i) a $34 million increase from our acquisition of uni-select, partially offset by (ii) individually insignificant decreases that had a $3 million impact in the aggregate.

(1)interest expense increased primarily due to (i) a $63 million increase from higher interest rates for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, (ii) a $58 million increase from higher outstanding debt primarily related to the permanent financing for the uni-select acquisition, (iii) a $9 million increase related to amortization of pre-acquisition bridge loan financing costs related to the uni-select acquisition, and (iv) a $6 million increase from foreign exchange translation, primarily related to an increase in the euro exchange rate.
(2)related to the uni-select acquisition. see note 3, "business combinations" and note 20, "derivative instruments and hedging activities" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information.
(3)the increase in interest income and other income, net is primarily comprised of (i) a $20 million increase related to interest income, mostly related to the proceeds from the u.s. notes (2028/33) that were invested in money market funds between the bond issuance date and the uni-select acquisition date, (ii) a $5 million increase from funds received to settle an eminent domain matter in 2023, (iii) a $3 million increase related to fair value adjustments for equity investments not accounted for under the equity method compared to the prior year, and (iv) a $2 million increase from the change in foreign currency gains and losses, partially offset by (v) individually insignificant decreases that had a $1 million impact in the aggregate.
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2023 was 24.8%, compared to 25.3% for the year ended december 31, 2022. the decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the year ended december 31, 2022, is primarily attributable to greater benefits from discrete items in 2023 than 2022. discrete items had favorable effects in both years, with a 2% rate benefit in the current year, mostly related to the uni-select acquisition foreign exchange forward contract gain, and a 1% rate benefit in the prior year, primarily related to the sale of pgw in the second quarter of 2022. unfavorable rate effects in 2023 from non-deductible transaction costs and negative impacts on foreign tax credit availability caused by uni-select related transaction activity partially offset the benefit from discrete items.
see note 24, "income taxes" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information.
equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased by $4 million primarily related to an increase in year over year results in an immaterial investment in our wholesale - north america segment.
foreign currency impact we translate our statements of income at the average exchange rates in effect for the period. relative to the rates used for the year ended december 31, 2022, the czech koruna, euro and the pound sterling rate used to translate the 2023 statements of income increased by 5.1%, 2.7% and 0.6%, respectively, while the canadian dollar rate decreased by 3.6%. realized and unrealized currency gains and losses (including the effects of hedge instruments) combined with the translation effect of the change in foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar had a net positive effect of $0.20 on diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31, 2023, mostly related to the $49 million pretax gain on the foreign exchange forward contract related to the uni-select acquisition.
net (loss) income from discontinued operations discontinued operations for the year ended december 31, 2023 reflected the gsf car parts business, which was acquired with the uni-select acquisition in august and was sold in october. the loss of $6 million represents the net of the operating results prior to the sale and the loss on disposal. income from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31, 2022 of $6 million primarily relates to adjustments to tax reserves on our glass manufacturing business. see note 4, "discontinued operations and divestitures" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on these businesses.
results of operations-segment reporting we have four reportable segments: wholesale - north america; europe; specialty; and self service.
we have presented the growth of our revenue and profitability in our operations on both an as reported and a constant currency basis. the constant currency presentation, which is a non-gaap measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. we believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our growth and profitability, consistent with how we evaluate our performance, as this statistic removes the translation impact of exchange rate fluctuations, which are outside of our control and do not reflect our operational performance. constant currency revenue and segment ebitda results are calculated by translating prior year revenue and segment ebitda in local currency using the current year's currency conversion rate. this non-gaap financial measure has important limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap. our use of this term may vary from the use of similarly-titled measures by other issuers due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation. in addition, not all companies that report revenue or profitability on a constant currency basis calculate such measures in the same manner as we do, and accordingly, our calculations are not necessarily comparable to similarly-named measures of other companies and may not be appropriate measures for performance relative to other companies.

note: in the table above, the percentages of total segment revenue may not recalculate due to rounding.
the key measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by our chief operating decision maker, our chief executive officer, is segment ebitda. we use segment ebitda to compare profitability among the segments and evaluate business strategies. segment ebitda includes revenue and expenses that are controllable by the segment. corporate general and administrative expenses are allocated to the segments based on usage, with shared expenses apportioned based on the segment's percentage of consolidated revenue. we calculate segment ebitda as net income attributable to lkq stockholders excluding discontinued operations; depreciation, amortization; interest; gains and losses on debt extinguishment; income tax expense; restructuring and transaction related expenses (which includes restructuring expenses recorded in cost of goods sold); change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities; other gains and losses related to acquisitions, equity method investments, or divestitures; equity in losses and earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries; equity investment fair value adjustments; impairment charges; and direct impacts of the ukraine/russia conflict and related sanctions (including provisions for and subsequent adjustments to reserves for asset recoverability and expenditures to support our employees and their families). see note 25, "segment and geographic information" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for a reconciliation of total segment ebitda to net income.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)parts and services organic revenue increased 8.2% (8.6% on a per day basis) for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by pricing initiatives which focused on offsetting inflation on input costs and a net volume increase. aftermarket collision parts volumes increased year over year due to reduced pressures on our supply chain. aftermarket collision parts volumes also grew as a result of the continued rollout of state farm's aftermarket parts program, which began on a trial basis in june 2022 and has subsequently been expanded.
(2)other organic revenue decreased 11.8%, or $41 million, year over year primarily related to (i) a $46 million decrease in revenue from precious metals (platinum, palladium, and rhodium) due to lower prices, partially offset by higher volumes, partially offset by (ii) a $5 million increase in revenue from other scrap (e.g., aluminum) and cores due to higher volumes, partially offset by lower prices.
(3)acquisition and divestiture parts and services revenue was a net increase of $432 million, or 10.3%, primarily due to the acquisition of uni-select in the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by the divestiture of our pgw aftermarket glass business in the second quarter of 2022. see note 3, "business combinations" and "other divestitures (not classified in discontinued operations)" in note 4, "discontinued operations and divestitures" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on the acquisition of uni-select and the divestiture of pgw, respectively.
segment ebitda segment ebitda increased $123 million, or 14.5%, for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, which includes a $46 million positive impact related to the acquisition of uni-select in the third quarter of 2023 (uni-select increases segment ebitda dollars but dilutes the segment ebitda percentage) and a $19 million negative year over year effect related to the pgw business, which we divested in the second quarter of 2022. the remaining increase is primarily attributable to lower freight costs, higher selling prices on parts, improved aftermarket volumes, and productivity initiatives helping to offset inflationary pressures related to product cost. we estimate that precious metals and scrap steel pricing had a net unfavorable effect of $28 million, or 0.4%, on segment ebitda margin relative to the prior year.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)the unfavorable impact related to the acquisition of uni-select in the third quarter of 2023 was primarily driven by (i) a 2.1% decrease in gross margin due to product mix as the paint, body, and equipment and maintenance parts lines have a lower gross margin structure than other wholesale product lines, partially offset by (ii) a favorable impact of 0.9% related to a decrease in overhead expenses as uni-select operates with lower overhead expenses than our other wholesale product lines.
(2)the increase in gross margin of 0.7% was primarily driven by (i) a 0.5% benefit from lower inbound freight costs and (ii) a 0.2% mix benefit resulting from the pgw divestiture in the second quarter of 2022.
(3)the decrease in segment operating expenses as a percentage of revenue reflects the favorable impact of (i) 0.5% from decreased freight, vehicle, and fuel costs and (ii) other individually immaterial factors representing a 0.2% favorable impact in the aggregate, partially offset by (iii) 0.4% from higher professional fees and (iv) 0.2% from higher charitable contributions.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)parts and services organic revenue for the year ended december 31, 2023 increased by 6.9% (7.4% on a per day basis), primarily driven by pricing initiatives across all geographies to offset increased costs resulting from inflationary pressures and to a lesser extent, higher volumes.
(2)acquisition and divestiture revenue was a net increase of $76 million, or 1.3%, primarily related to our acquisition of seven wholesale businesses from the beginning of 2022 through the one-year anniversary of the acquisition dates.
(3)exchange rates increased our revenue growth by $121 million, or 2.1%, primarily due to the weaker u.s. dollar against the euro, czech koruna and pound sterling for the year ended december 31, 2023 relative to the prior year.
segment ebitda segment ebitda increased $29 million, or 5.1%, for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior year. on a constant currency basis (i.e., excluding the translation impact), segment ebitda increased by $18 million, or 3.0%, compared to the prior year. the increase in dollar terms is attributable to organic revenue growth of $391 million and benefits from productivity initiatives. europe's results were negatively impacted by an $11 million charge to settle a value-added tax issue in italy related to prior years and a loss of revenue and associated margin in our german operations caused by labor strikes, which we estimate resulted in lower segment ebitda of $17 million. refer to the foreign currency impact discussion within the results of operations-consolidated section above for further detail regarding foreign currency impact on our results for the year ended december 31, 2023.

(1)gross margin was flat on a year to date basis, as favorable impacts from price increases were offset by inflationary pressures and difficult macro-economic conditions causing consumer price sensitivity, most notably in our central and eastern european regions.
(2)the increase in segment operating expenses as a percentage of revenue primarily reflects the unfavorable impacts of (i) 0.2% due to the settlement of a value-added tax issue in italy and (ii) leverage effects of 0.2% caused by strike activity in germany.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)parts and services organic revenue for the year ended december 31, 2023, decreased by 10.1% primarily due to demand softness in the rv product line, as rv unit retail sales and wholesale shipments have declined year over year.
(2)acquisition and divestiture revenue was a net increase of $64 million, or 3.6%, primarily related to our acquisition of one specialty business in 2023.
segment ebitda segment ebitda decreased $65 million, or 32.7%, for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior year primarily due to the organic revenue decline and the negative effect of inflation on overhead expenses.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)the decrease in gross margin primarily was driven by (i) product channel mix toward lower margin auto and marine products and (ii) increased competitive pricing due to broader availability of inventory among competitors in the market.
(2)segment operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased despite the negative leverage effect from the 10.1% organic revenue decline. this was primarily due to a 0.2% decrease in personnel costs, mainly driven by decreased workers compensation and health insurance expenses, as well as restructuring activities.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)parts and services organic revenue increased 2.4% for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by pricing initiatives which focused on offsetting inflation on input costs resulting from greater competition for vehicles.
(2)other organic revenue decreased 19.1%, or $93 million, year over year due to (i) a $79 million decrease in revenue from precious metals (platinum, palladium, and rhodium) due to lower prices, (ii) a $20 million decrease in revenue from scrap steel related to lower prices and lower volumes, partially offset by (iii) a $6 million increase in revenue from other scrap (including aluminum) and cores primarily related to higher volumes, partially offset by lower prices.
(3)acquisition and divestiture revenue was a net decrease of $30 million, or 4.2% due to the divestiture of a business in the third quarter of 2022. see "other divestitures (not classified in discontinued operations)" in note 4, "discontinued operations and divestitures" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on the divestiture.
segment ebitda segment ebitda decreased $47 million, or 57.3%, for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior year. the decrease is driven by the decline in revenue due to unfavorable movements in commodity prices compared to the prior year and gross margin compression as vehicle procurement costs have decreased at a lesser rate than commodity prices. decreases in precious metals prices contributed an estimated $60 million decline in segment ebitda relative to the year ended december 31, 2022. net sequential changes in scrap steel prices partially offset the impact of the decline in precious metals prices. during the year ended december 31, 2023, scrap steel prices had a $5 million favorable impact on segment ebitda, compared to an $15 million unfavorable impact during the year ended december 31, 2022. the favorable impacts for the year ended december 31, 2023 resulted from the increase in scrap steel prices between the date we purchased a vehicle, which influences the price we pay for a vehicle, and the date we scrapped a vehicle, which influences the price we receive for scrapping a vehicle.

note: in the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
(1)the decrease in gross margin reflects an unfavorable impact resulting from vehicle procurement costs decreasing at a lesser rate than commodity prices.
(2)the increase in segment operating expenses as a percentage of revenue reflects (i) a negative leverage effect of 5.7% from decreases in metals revenue, partially offset by (ii) other individually immaterial factors representing a 1.5% favorable impact in the aggregate.
liquidity and capital resources we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to fund our operations and provide for expansion through both internal development and acquisitions. our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and our revolving credit facilities. we utilize our cash flows from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures, with the excess amounts going towards funding acquisitions, paying down outstanding debt, paying dividends or repurchasing our common stock. as we have pursued acquisitions as part of our historical growth strategy, our cash flows from operations have not always been sufficient to cover our investing activities. to fund our acquisitions, we have accessed various forms of debt financing, including revolving credit facilities and senior notes. we currently believe we have sufficient access to capital markets to support our future growth objectives.

(1)    interest rate derived via a weighted average we had approximately $976 million available under our revolving credit facilities in place as of december 31, 2023. combined with $299 million of cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2023, we had approximately $1,275 million in available liquidity, a decrease of $298 million from our available liquidity as of december 31, 2022, primarily as a result of reducing our overall revolving credit facility capacity by $650 million after entering into the senior unsecured credit agreement.
the enterprise value for the uni-select acquisition at the time of the acquisition was approximately cad 2.8 billion ($2.1 billion), which was financed with the gross proceeds from the issuance of unsecured senior notes of $1,400 million, senior unsecured term loan agreement ("cad note") of cad 700 million, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand of approximately $150 million and $50 million, respectively.
we believe that our current liquidity, cash expected to be generated by operating activities in future periods and access to capital markets will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements. however, as noted, we accessed additional financing sources to fund the uni-select transaction. our capital allocation strategy includes spending to support growth driven capital projects, complete synergistic acquisitions, and return stockholder value through the payment of dividends and repurchasing shares of our common stock.
see part ii, item 5 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on a summary of the dividend activity for our common stock for the year ended december 31, 2023.
on february 20, 2024, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share of common stock, payable on march 28, 2024, to stockholders of record at the close of business on march 14, 2024.
we believe that our future cash flow generation will permit us to continue paying dividends in future periods; however, the timing, amount and frequency of such future dividends will be subject to approval by our board, and based on considerations of capital availability, and various other factors, many of which are outside of our control.
with $1,275 million of total liquidity as of december 31, 2023 and $596 million of current maturities, we have access to funds to meet our near term commitments. our current maturities include the 3.875% €500 million euro notes (2024) due april 2024, which we intend to refinance on or before the scheduled maturity. we have a surplus of current assets over current liabilities, which further reduces the risk of short-term cash shortfalls.
our senior unsecured credit agreement and our cad note both include two financial maintenance covenants: a maximum total leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio. the terms maximum total leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio are specifically calculated per both the senior unsecured credit agreement and cad note, and differ in specified ways from comparable gaap or common usage terms. we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under both our senior unsecured credit agreement and cad note as of december 31, 2023. the required debt covenants per both the senior unsecured credit agreement and cad note and our actual ratios with respect to those covenants are as follows as of december 31, 2023:
covenant level                ratio achieved as of december 31, 2023
maximum total leverage ratio                  4.00 : 1.00                                                   2.3
minimum interest coverage ratio               3.00 : 1.00                                                   7.5
the total leverage ratio increased from 1.5 as of december 31, 2022 as we added debt from the u.s. notes (2028/33) and the cad note in the second and third quarters of 2023. the spread applied to the interest rate on our credit facility borrowings increased in the third quarter and remained the same through the fourth quarter as a result of the total leverage ratio rising above 2.0.
the indentures relating to our u.s. notes and euro notes do not include financial maintenance covenants, and the indentures will not restrict our ability to draw funds under the senior unsecured credit agreement. the indentures do not prohibit amendments to the financial covenants under the senior unsecured credit agreement and cad note as needed.
while we believe that we have adequate capacity under our existing revolving credit facilities to finance our current operations, from time to time we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing, strategic relationships or modification of our existing senior unsecured credit agreement to finance additional investments or to refinance existing debt obligations. there can be no assurance that additional funding, or refinancing of our senior unsecured credit agreement, if needed, will be available on terms attractive to us, or at all. furthermore, any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants or higher interest costs. our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
as part of our effort to improve our operating cash flows, we may negotiate payment term extensions with suppliers. these efforts are supported by our supply chain finance programs. see note 18, "supply chain financing" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information related to our supply chain financing arrangements.
we hold interest rate swaps to hedge the variable rates on a portion of our credit agreement borrowings. after giving effect to these contracts outstanding, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our senior unsecured credit agreement was 6.0% at december 31, 2023. including our senior notes and cad note, our overall weighted average interest rate on borrowings was 5.7% at december 31, 2023. under the senior unsecured credit agreement, our borrowings bear interest at secured overnight financing rate (i.e. sofr) plus the applicable spread or other risk-free interest rates that are applicable for the specified currency plus a spread. under the cad note, the interest rate may be (i) a forward-looking term rate based on the canadian dollar offer rate for an interest period chosen by the company of one or three months or (ii) the canadian prime rate (as defined in the cad note), plus in each case a spread based on the company's debt rating and total leverage ratio. see note 19, "long-term obligations" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for information related to our borrowings and related interest. the interest rate swaps are described in note 20, "derivative instruments and hedging activities" to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
we had outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and the term loans payable of $1,943 million and $1,786 million at december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. of these amounts, there were no current maturities at december 31, 2023 or 2022.
the scheduled maturities of long-term obligations outstanding at december 31, 2023 are as follows (in millions):

(1)long-term obligations maturing by december 31, 2024 include $16 million of short-term debt that may be extended beyond the current year ending december 31, 2024.
(2)the total debt amounts presented above reflect the gross values to be repaid (excluding debt issuance costs and unamortized bond discount of $30 million as of december 31, 2023).
as of december 31, 2023, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $299 million, of which $232 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. in general, it is our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. we believe that we have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to meet our financial obligations in the u.s. without repatriating our foreign earnings. we may, from time to time, choose to selectively repatriate foreign earnings if doing so supports our financing or liquidity objectives. distributions of dividends from our foreign subsidiaries, if any, would be generally exempt from further u.s. taxation, either as a result of the 100% participation exemption under the tax cuts and jobs act enacted in 2017, or due to the previous taxation of foreign earnings under the transition tax and the global intangible low-taxed income regime ("gilti").
the procurement of inventory is the largest operating use of our funds. we normally pay for aftermarket product purchases on standard payment terms or at the time of shipment, depending on the manufacturer and the negotiated payment terms. we normally pay for salvage vehicles acquired at salvage auctions and under direct procurement arrangements at the time that we take possession of the vehicles.
the following table sets forth a summary of our aftermarket and manufactured inventory procurement for the years ended december 31, 2023, and 2022 (in millions):

(1)inventory purchases across the wholesale - north america segment increased for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior year primarily due to a $393 million increase attributable to inventory purchases at uni-select from the date of acquisition through december 31, 2023, partially offset by higher purchasing levels in the prior year due to restocking efforts to rebuild inventory levels.
(2)the increase in inventory purchases in our europe segment included an increase of $70 million attributable to the increase in the value of the euro, and to a lesser extent, the pound sterling for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior year. on a constant currency basis, inventory purchases increased compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased sales and prices for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the prior year.
(3)the decrease in inventory purchases in the specialty segment compared to the prior year was primarily due to matching inventory levels with demand.

wholesale - north america salvage purchases in 2023 increased relative to the prior year due to improved availability of vehicles at auctions. self service salvage purchases in 2023 decreased relative to the prior year due to a focus on reducing car cost as car costs rose faster than commodity prices in late 2022 and early 2023.

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2023              $1,356
(1)    cash flows related to our primary working capital accounts can be volatile as the purchases, payments and collections can be timed differently from period to period.
•receivables was a $21 million incremental cash inflow in 2023 primarily at our wholesale - north america and europe segments as a result of collections and timing of sales.
•inventories represented $413 million in incremental cash inflows for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022, including $294 million in our europe segment primarily due to improved inventory management, $93 million in our wholesale - north america segment primarily due to higher purchasing levels in 2022 due to restocking efforts to rebuild inventory levels, and $26 million in our specialty segment inventory due to decreasing inventory purchasing levels to align with softening demand.
•accounts payable produced $274 million in incremental cash outflows for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022 on a consolidated basis. this was primarily attributable to incremental cash outflows in our wholesale - north america segment of $295 million (partly related to accelerated vendor payments in late 2021 to ensure priority access to inventory), partially offset by our specialty segment which contributed a $16 million lower cash outflow. europe was roughly flat primarily attributable to higher payments in 2023, resulting from increased inventory purchases in 2022 that were in accounts payable at the end of december 2022, offset by an increase in its accounts payable under its supply chain financing program, which has longer payment terms.
(2)    primarily reflects the aggregate effect of higher interest payments (primarily due to higher interest rates and additional borrowings for the uni-select acquisition), partially offset by lower cash paid for taxes during the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022.
for the year ended december 31, 2023, net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,442 million compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $172 million for the same period of 2022. we invested $2,225 million and $4 million of cash in business acquisitions during the years ended december 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. proceeds from the disposal of businesses were $110 million for the year ended december 31, 2023, primarily related to gsf car parts, compared to $399 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 primarily related to pgw. property, plant and equipment purchases were $358 million for the year ended december 31, 2023 compared to $222 million in the prior year. during the year ended december 31, 2023, we settled our foreign exchange forward contracts related to the uni-select purchase price with the counterparties and received $49 million due primarily to strengthening in the canadian exchange rate relative to the contract rates.

for the year ended december 31, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities totaled $1,102 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $1,394 million for the same period of 2022. the increase is primarily due to proceeds (net of unamortized bond discount) of $1,394 million from the issuance of the u.s. notes (2028/33) in 2023, decreases in repurchases of common stock of $1,002 million, and net borrowings of $111 million for the year ended december 31, 2023 (including proceeds from the cad note of $531 million) compared to net repayments on our debt of $48 million for the same period of 2022.
we intend to continue to evaluate markets for potential growth through the internal development of distribution centers, processing and sales facilities, and warehouses, through further integration of our facilities, and through selected business acquisitions. our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including the costs and timing of our internal development efforts and the success of those efforts.

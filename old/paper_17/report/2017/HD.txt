item 1a. risk factors.
the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. you should read these risk factors in conjunction with "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8. there also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material. those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations.
strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share.
our industry is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. as a result, we face competition for our products and services from a variety of retailers, suppliers, and service providers, ranging from traditional brick-and-mortar, to
7
multichannel, to exclusively online. in each of the markets we serve, there are a number of other home improvement retailers; electrical, plumbing and building materials supply houses; and lumber yards. with respect to some products and services, we also compete with specialty design stores, showrooms, discount stores, local, regional and national hardware stores, paint stores, mail order firms, warehouse clubs, independent building supply stores, mro companies, home décor retailers, and other retailers, as well as with providers of home improvement services and tool and equipment rental.
we compete, both in-store and online, primarily based on customer experience, price, quality, availability, assortment, and delivery options. with respect to our stores, we also compete based on store location and appearance as well as presentation of merchandise. our customers routinely use computers, tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices to shop online, read product reviews, and compare prices, products, and delivery options, regardless of whether they shop in-store or online. further, online and multichannel retailers are increasingly focusing on delivery services, with customers seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times and low-price or free shipping. our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors, including the success of our investments in one home depot supply chain, and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins.
we use our marketing, advertising and promotional programs to drive customer traffic and compete more effectively, and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive landscape. intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors, such as through aggressive promotional pricing or liquidation events, or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape, could affect our prices, our margins, or demand for our products and services. if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures, including through the delivery of a superior customer experience or maintenance of effective marketing, advertising or promotional programs, our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected.
we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.
the success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics; consumer preferences, expectations and needs; and unexpected weather conditions or natural disasters, while also managing appropriate inventory levels and maintaining an excellent customer experience. it is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customers will demand. in addition, each of our primary customer groups has different needs and expectations, many of which evolve as the demographics in a particular customer group change. we also need to offer more localized assortments of our merchandise to appeal to local cultural and demographic tastes within each customer group. if we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of - or within - a customer group, we may lose market share with respect to those customers.
customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are also becoming more demanding. as noted above, customers routinely use technology and mobile devices to rapidly compare products and prices, determine real-time product availability, and purchase products. once products are purchased, customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products, and they often expect quick, timely, and low-price or free delivery. we must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process. we have our boss, bopis, bodfs and direct fulfillment delivery options, but we cannot guarantee that these or future programs will be implemented successfully or that we will be able to meet customer expectations on delivery times, options and costs. customers are also using social media to provide feedback and information about our company and products and services in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated. to the extent a customer has a negative experience and shares it over social media, it may impact our brand and reputation.
further, we have an aging store base that requires maintenance, investment, and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire. our investments in our stores may not deliver the relevant shopping experience our customers expect. we must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates. failure to maintain our stores, utilize our store space effectively, and offer a safe shopping environment; to provide a compelling online presence; to timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and home improvement needs; to provide quick and low-price or free delivery alternatives; to differentiate the customer experience for our primary customer groups; and to effectively
8
implement an increasingly localized merchandising assortment could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.
our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified associates while also controlling our labor costs.
our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates. to meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, develop and retain a large number of highly qualified associates while at the same time controlling labor costs. our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs, as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, minimum wage, or healthcare benefits. an inability to provide wages and/or benefits that are competitive within the markets in which we operate could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract employees. conversely, changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our labor costs. in addition, we compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. these positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs, particularly in a competitive labor market. there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified associates in the future.
a failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business.
we rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed or provided by third-party service providers, to analyze, process, store, manage and protect transactions and data. in managing our business, we also rely heavily on the integrity of, security of and consistent access to this data for information such as sales, customer data, merchandise ordering, inventory replenishment and order fulfillment. for these information technology systems and processes to operate effectively, we or our service providers must periodically maintain and update them. our systems and the third-party systems on which we rely are subject to damage or interruption from a number of causes, including power outages; computer and telecommunications failures; computer viruses; security breaches; cyber-attacks, including the use of ransomware; catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, or hurricanes; acts of war or terrorism; and design or usage errors by our associates, contractors or third-party service providers. although we and our third-party service providers seek to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems, such efforts may not be successful. as a result, we or our service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure, which could significantly disrupt our operations and be costly, time consuming and resource-intensive to remedy.
disruptions in our customer-facing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences.
through our information technology developments, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping and interconnected retail experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers, tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices. we use our websites and our mobile app both as sales channels for our products and also as methods of providing inspiration, as well as product, project, and other relevant information to our customers to drive both in-store and online sales. we have multiple online communities and knowledge centers that allow us to inform, assist and interact with our customers. multichannel retailing is continually evolving and expanding, and we must effectively respond to changing customer preferences and new developments. we continually seek to enhance all of our online properties to provide an attractive, user-friendly interface for our customers, as evidenced by our recent re-platform of our homedepot.com website. disruptions, failures or other performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our online and in-store business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers.
the implementation of our store, interconnected retail, supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail.
we recently announced our intent to substantially increase our investments to create the one home depot experience, including significant investments over the next five years to build a one home depot supply chain. these initiatives are designed to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high-quality service to our customers, simplify customer interaction, provide our customers with a more interconnected retail experience, and create the fastest, most efficient delivery network for home improvement products. the cost
9
and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers, employing new web-based tools and services, and addressing impacts on inventory levels, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term, lead to product availability issues, and impact profitability. further, accomplishing these initiatives will require a substantial investment in additional information technology personnel and other specialized personnel. we may face significant competition in the market for these resources and may not be successful in our hiring efforts. failure to choose the right investments and implement them in the right manner and at the right pace could disrupt our operations. in addition, our store and interconnected retail initiatives, enhanced supply chain, and new or upgraded information technology systems might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business.
a disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs, or damage to our reputation. such disruptions may result from damage or destruction to our distribution centers; weather-related events; natural disasters; trade policy changes or restrictions; tariffs or import-related taxes; third-party strikes, lock-outs, work stoppages or slowdowns; shipping capacity constraints; third-party contract disputes; supply or shipping interruptions or costs; military conflicts; acts of terrorism; or other factors beyond our control. any such disruption could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition.
if our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of customer, associate, supplier and company information are not successful, we could incur substantial costs and reputational damage and could become subject to litigation and enforcement actions.
our business, like that of most retailers, involves the receipt, storage and transmission of customers' personal information, preferences, and payment card information, as well as other confidential information, such as personal information about our associates and our suppliers and confidential company information. we also work with third-party service providers and vendors that provide technology, systems and services that we use in connection with the receipt, storage and transmission of this information. our information systems, and those of our third-party service providers and vendors, are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving data protection and cybersecurity risks. unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to these systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates, third-party service providers or vendors. hardware, software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. the methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. we have implemented and regularly review and update systems, processes, and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of data and to prevent data loss. however, the ever-evolving threats mean we and our third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment, as well as those of any companies we acquire. there is no guarantee that these measures will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, system compromises or misuses of data. as we experienced in connection with the data breach we discovered in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 (the "data breach"), any significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, associate, supplier or company data, could result in significant costs, including costs to investigate and remediate, as well as lost sales, fines, lawsuits, and damage to our reputation. in addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in significant costs.
we are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability, and potentially disrupt our business.
we accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, paypal, our private label credit cards, an installment loan program, trade credit, and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time. acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards
10
and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. these requirements may change over time or be reinterpreted, making compliance more difficult or costly. for certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. if these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could potentially disrupt our business. the payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. if we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements for the payment methods we accept, or if payment-related data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments may be impaired. in addition, our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which may result in a shift to other payment types or potential changes to our payment systems that may result in higher costs. as a result, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.
uncertainty regarding the housing market, economic conditions, political climate and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business, and our financial performance.
our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing, residential construction and home improvement markets, as well as general economic conditions, including changes in gross domestic product. adverse conditions in or uncertainty about these markets, the economy or the political climate could adversely impact our customers' confidence or financial condition, causing them to determine not to purchase home improvement products and services, causing them to delay purchasing decisions, or impacting their ability to pay for products and services. other factors beyond our control - including unemployment and foreclosure rates; inventory loss due to theft; interest rate fluctuations; fuel and other energy costs; labor and healthcare costs; the availability of financing; the state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit; weather; natural disasters; acts of terrorism; and other conditions beyond our control - could further adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business, and our financial performance.
if we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if our suppliers experience financial difficulties or other challenges, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected.
we buy our products from suppliers located throughout the world. our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and responsible sourcing, as well as our need to access products in a timely and efficient manner, is a significant challenge. our ability to access products from our suppliers can be adversely affected by political instability, military conflict, acts of terrorism, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, any disruptions in our suppliers' logistics or supply chain networks or information technology systems, and other factors beyond our or our suppliers' control.
if we are unable to effectively manage and expand our alliances and relationships with selected suppliers of both brand name and proprietary products, we may be unable to effectively execute our strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors.
as part of our focus on product differentiation, we have formed strategic alliances and exclusive relationships with selected suppliers to market products under a variety of well-recognized brand names. we have also developed relationships with selected suppliers to allow us to market proprietary products that are comparable to national brands. our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers, generally carry higher margins than national brand products, and represent a growing portion of our business. if we are unable to manage and expand these alliances and relationships or identify alternative sources for comparable brand name and proprietary products, we may not be able to effectively execute product differentiation, which may impact our sales and gross margin results.
failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customers and negatively impact our sales and results of operations.
product and service quality issues could negatively impact customer confidence in our brands and our company. if our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations
11
regarding safety or quality, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal, financial and reputational risks, as well as governmental enforcement actions. actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to litigation, as well as government enforcement actions, and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. we seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our vendors. if we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available, such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. even with adequate insurance and indemnification, our reputation as a provider of high quality products and services, including both national brand names and our proprietary products, could suffer, damaging our reputation and impacting customer loyalty. in addition, we and our customers have expectations around responsible sourcing. all of our vendors and service providers must comply with our ser standards, which cover a variety of expectations across multiple areas of social compliance, including supply chain transparency, sources of supply, and child and forced labor. we have an ser audit process, but we are also dependent on our vendors and service providers to ensure that the products and services we provide comply with our standards.
our proprietary products subject us to certain increased risks.
as we expand our proprietary product offerings, we may become subject to increased risks due to our greater role in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of those products. the risks include greater responsibility to administer and comply with applicable regulatory requirements, increased potential product liability and product recall exposure, and increased potential reputational risks related to the responsible sourcing of those products. to effectively execute on our product differentiation strategy, we must also be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties. in addition, an increase in sales of our proprietary products may adversely affect sales of our vendors' products, which in turn could adversely affect our relationships with certain of our vendors. any failure to appropriately address some or all of these risks could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
if we are unable to manage effectively our installation services business, we could suffer lost sales and be subject to fines, lawsuits and reputational damage, or the loss of our general contractor licenses.
we act as a general contractor to provide installation services to our difm customers through professional third-party installers. as such, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of work performed by our third-party installers. we have established processes and procedures to manage these requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with the services provided by our third-party installers. however, if we fail to manage these processes effectively or to provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines, lawsuits, and governmental enforcement actions for violations of regulatory requirements, as well as for property damage or personal injury. in addition, we may suffer damage to our reputation or the loss of our general contractor licenses, which could adversely affect our business.
our strategic transactions involve risks, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions.
we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, investments, alliances, and other growth and market expansion strategies, with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in sales, cost savings, synergies and various other benefits. assessing the viability and realizing the benefits of these transactions is subject to significant uncertainty. in fiscal 2015, we acquired interline, which we believe has enhanced our ability to serve our pros. in fiscal 2017, we acquired compact power and the company store to expand our product and service offerings. with these and any other acquisitions, we need to successfully integrate each target company's products, services, associates and systems into our business operations. integration can be a complex and time-consuming process, and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition. furthermore, even if the target companies are successfully integrated, the acquisitions may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or services, and expose us to additional liabilities. any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets acquired in a strategic transaction may reduce our earnings.
12
our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations.
we are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business. in recent years, a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted, and there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies. these laws and regulations, and related interpretations and enforcement activity, may change as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements; other wage, labor or workplace regulations; healthcare; data protection and cybersecurity; the sale of some of our products; transportation; logistics; international trade; supply chain transparency; taxes; unclaimed property; energy costs; or environmental matters, including with respect to our installation services business, could increase our costs of doing business or impact our operations.
in fiscal 2017, congress enacted the tax act, which significantly changes how the u.s. taxes corporations. the tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required under u.s. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the tax act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. the u.s. treasury department, the irs, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretations. the ultimate impact of the tax act on us may differ from our current estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by us as well as the issuance of any further regulations or guidance that may alter the operation of the u.s. federal income tax code. as we complete our analysis of the tax act, we may make adjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made. further, uncertainties also exist in terms of how u.s. states and foreign countries within which we operate will react to these u.s. federal income tax changes, which could have additional impacts on our effective tax rate.
if we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in our international operations and our sales and profit margins may be negatively impacted.
our ability to successfully conduct retail operations in, and source products and materials from, international markets is affected by many of the same risks we face in our u.s. operations, as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations. our international operations, including any expansion in international markets, may be adversely affected by local laws and customs, u.s. laws applicable to foreign operations and other foreign legal and regulatory constraints, as well as political and economic conditions. risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, potential adverse tax consequences; potential tariffs and other import-related taxes and controls; greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights; risks associated with the foreign corrupt practices act and local anti-bribery law compliance; and challenges in our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers. in addition, our operations in international markets create risk due to foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates, which may adversely impact our sales and profit margins.
the inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins.
prices of certain commodity products, including lumber and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect the demand for our products, our sales and our profit margins.
we may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by our insurance.
we are predominantly self-insured for a number of different risk categories, such as general liability (including product liability), workers' compensation, employee group medical, automobile claims, and network security and privacy liability, with insurance coverage for certain catastrophic risks. the types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements. the occurrence of significant claims, a substantial rise in costs to maintain our insurance, or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
13
changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition.
generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, lease obligations, self-insurance, tax matters and litigation, are complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. changes in accounting standards or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition.
we are involved in a number of legal, regulatory and governmental enforcement proceedings, and while we cannot predict the outcomes of those proceedings and other contingencies with certainty, some of these outcomes may adversely affect our operations or increase our costs.
we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and regulatory matters, including government inquiries and investigations, and consumer, employment, tort and other litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking actions which could adversely affect our operations or could result in excessive adverse verdicts. additionally, involvement in these lawsuits, investigations and inquiries, and other proceedings may involve significant expense, divert management's attention and resources from other matters, and impact the reputation of the company.

we reported net sales of $100.9 billion in fiscal 2017. net earnings were $8.6 billion, or $7.29 per diluted share, and reflected the following:
•   in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, three hurricanes impacted our operations in the continental u.s., puerto rico, and the u.s. virgin islands. hurricane-related sales contributed approximately $662 million to net sales in the second half of fiscal 2017. the gross profit on these hurricane-related sales was considerably less than the company average. we also incurred approximately $170 million of hurricane-related expenses in the second half of fiscal 2017.
•   in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we paid a one-time cash bonus to our u.s. hourly associates, which negatively impacted net earnings by $72 million and reduced diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.06.
•   on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted the tax act, which included a reduction in the u.s. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and a transition to a modified territorial system. as a result of the enactment of the tax act, we recorded a net $127 million charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. this charge resulted in a $0.11 reduction to diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2017 (see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion).
•   results for fiscal 2017 also reflected a benefit of $106 million to our provision for income taxes for share-based payment awards resulting from the adoption of asu no. 2016-09, "compensation-stock compensation (topic 718): improvements to employee share-based payment accounting" in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. this benefit contributed $0.09 to diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2017.
we opened three new stores in the u.s. and three new stores in mexico during fiscal 2017, for a total store count of 2,284 at january 28, 2018. at the end of fiscal 2017, a total of 304 of our stores, or 13.3%, were located in canada and mexico. total sales per square foot were $417.02 in fiscal 2017, and our inventory turnover ratio was 5.1 times at the end of fiscal 2017.
in february 2017, our board of directors increased our targeted dividend payout ratio to 55% of prior-year diluted earnings per share. also in february 2017, our board of directors authorized a $15.0 billion share repurchase program that replaced the previous authorization. in december 2017, our board of directors authorized a new $15.0 billion share repurchase program that replaced the february 2017 authorization. during fiscal 2017, we repurchased a total of 49.5 million shares of our common stock for $8.0 billion through asr agreements and open market transactions. in february 2018, we announced a 15.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $1.03 per share.
we generated $12.0 billion of cash flow from operations during fiscal 2017. this cash flow, along with $3.0 billion of long-term debt and $850 million of net short-term borrowings in fiscal 2017, was used to repay $500 million of floating rate senior notes that matured in september 2017, fund cash payments of $8.0 billion for share repurchases, pay $4.2 billion of cash dividends, fund $1.9 billion in capital expenditures, and acquire compact power and the company store.
our roic was 34.2% for fiscal 2017. we define roic as nopat, a non-gaap financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by the average of beginning and ending long-term debt (including current
20
installments) and equity for the most recent twelve-month period. for a reconciliation of nopat to net earnings, the most comparable gaap financial measure, and our calculation of roic, see the "non-gaap financial measures" section below.
results of operations the tables and discussion below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. we believe the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in our consolidated statements of earnings, as well as the percentage change in the associated dollar amounts, are relevant to an evaluation of our business.

fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
sales. we assess our sales performance by evaluating both net sales and comparable sales.
net sales. net sales for fiscal 2017 increased $6.3 billion, or 6.7%, to $100.9 billion. the increase in net sales in fiscal 2017 primarily reflected the impact of positive comparable sales driven by increased customer transactions and average ticket growth. hurricane-related sales contributed approximately $662 million to net sales in the second half of fiscal 2017.
21
comparable sales. comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-period of equivalent length. comparable sales includes sales at all locations, physical and online, open greater than 52 weeks (including remodels and relocations) and excluding closed stores. retail stores become comparable on the monday following their 365th day of operation. acquisitions, digital or otherwise, are included after we own them for greater than 52 weeks (with the exception of interline which is excluded from comparable sales). comparable sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with gaap.
total comparable sales increased 6.8% in fiscal 2017. the increase in comparable sales reflected a number of factors, including the execution of our strategy and broad-based growth across our stores and online. online sales, which consist of sales generated online through our websites for products picked up in our stores or delivered to customer locations, represented 6.7% of net sales and grew 21.5% during fiscal 2017. all of our merchandising departments posted positive comparable sales except for one, which was flat in fiscal 2017. comparable sales for our lumber, electrical, tools, appliances, flooring, building materials, and indoor garden merchandising departments were above the company average during fiscal 2017. our comparable customer transactions increased 2.2% during fiscal 2017. further, our comparable average ticket increased 4.5% in fiscal 2017, due in part to strong sales in big ticket purchases in certain merchandising departments, such as appliances and flooring.
gross profit. gross profit increased $2.0 billion, or 6.3%, to $34.4 billion in fiscal 2017. gross profit as a percent of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 34.0% in fiscal 2017 compared to 34.2% in fiscal 2016. the modest decline in gross profit margin for fiscal 2017 reflected the impact of lower margin hurricane-related sales and higher shrink, partially offset by benefits from our supply chain.
operating expenses. our operating expenses are composed of sg&a and depreciation and amortization.
selling, general & administrative. sg&a increased $732 million, or 4.3%, to $17.9 billion in fiscal 2017 and included approximately $170 million of hurricane-related expenses. as a percent of net sales, sg&a was 17.7% for fiscal 2017 compared to 18.1% for fiscal 2016. the decrease in sg&a as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2017 reflected expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable sales environment and continued expense control.
depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization increased $57 million, or 3.2%, in fiscal 2017. the decrease in depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales to 1.8% in fiscal 2017 from 1.9% in fiscal 2016 reflected expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable sales environment.
interest and other, net. interest and other, net, was $983 million for fiscal 2017 compared to $936 million for fiscal 2016. interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 1.0% for both fiscal 2017 and 2016 and reflected additional interest expense in fiscal 2017 resulting from higher long-term debt balances in fiscal 2017, offset by higher interest income in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.
provision for income taxes. our combined effective income tax rate was 37.0% for fiscal 2017 compared to 36.3% for fiscal 2016. the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2017 reflected a net $127 million charge resulting from the enactment of the tax act. the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2017 also reflected a $106 million benefit to our provision for income taxes for share-based payment awards as a result of our adoption of asu no. 2016-09 (see note 1 and note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion).
diluted earnings per share. diluted earnings per share were $7.29 for fiscal 2017 compared to $6.45 for fiscal 2016. diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 included a benefit of $0.09 per share as a result of the adoption of asu no. 2016-09, as well as decreases of $0.11 per share due to the net tax charge recorded in connection with the enactment of the tax act and $0.06 per share due to the one-time bonus payment to hourly associates made as a result of the tax act.
fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
sales.
net sales. net sales for fiscal 2016 increased $6.1 billion, or 6.9%, to $94.6 billion. the increase in net sales for fiscal 2016 primarily reflected the impact of positive comparable sales driven by increased customer transactions and average ticket growth, as well as sales from interline, which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.
22
the increase in net sales was partially offset by pressure from a stronger u.s. dollar, which negatively impacted total sales growth by $549 million in fiscal 2016.
comparable sales. total comparable sales increased 5.6% for fiscal 2016, which reflected a number of factors, including the execution of our strategy, improved strength across our business, and an improved u.s. home improvement market. online sales represented 5.9% of net sales and grew 19.3% during fiscal 2016. all of our merchandising departments posted positive comparable sales for fiscal 2016. comparable sales for our appliances, tools, lumber, lighting, décor, building materials, and indoor garden merchandising departments were above the company average for fiscal 2016. further, our comparable customer transactions increased 2.8% for fiscal 2016 and comparable average ticket increased 2.7% for fiscal 2016, due in part to strong sales in big ticket purchases in merchandising departments such as appliances, flooring, and roofing, offset in part by a stronger u.s. dollar.
gross profit. gross profit for fiscal 2016 increased $2.0 billion, or 6.8%, to $32.3 billion. gross profit as a percent of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 34.2% for both fiscal 2016 and 2015. gross profit margin for fiscal 2016 reflected the impact of product mix changes, offset by benefits from our supply chain driven by increased productivity, and benefits from reaching higher levels of co-op allowances and rebates in certain category classes.
operating expenses.
selling, general & administrative. sg&a for fiscal 2016 increased $331 million, or 2.0%, to $17.1 billion. sg&a included data breach-related pretax expenses of $37 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $128 million of pretax net expenses in fiscal 2015. as a percent of net sales, sg&a was 18.1% for fiscal 2016 compared to 19.0% for fiscal 2015. the decrease in sg&a as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2016 reflected expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable sales environment and strong expense control.
depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2016 increased $64 million, or 3.8%, to $1.8 billion. depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 1.9% for both fiscal 2016 and 2015. depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2016 reflected minor expense leverage resulting from the positive comparable sales environment.
interest and other, net. in fiscal 2016, we recognized $936 million of interest and other, net, compared to $753 million for fiscal 2015. interest and other, net, for fiscal 2015 included a $144 million pretax gain related to the sale of our remaining equity ownership in hd supply. interest and other, net, as a percent of net sales was 1.0% for fiscal 2016 compared to 0.9% for fiscal 2015 due primarily to the hd supply pretax gain in fiscal 2015 noted above and higher long-term debt balances in fiscal 2016.
provision for income taxes. our combined effective income tax rate was 36.3% for fiscal 2016 and 36.4% for fiscal 2015.
diluted earnings per share. diluted earnings per share were $6.45 for fiscal 2016 compared to $5.46 for fiscal 2015. expenses related to the data breach resulted in decreases of $0.02 and $0.06 to diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. the gain on the sale of our remaining equity ownership in hd supply contributed a benefit of $0.07 to diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015.
non-gaap financial measures to provide clarity, internally and externally, about our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with certain non-gaap financial measures. however, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures. non-gaap financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies.
return on invested capital. we believe roic is meaningful for investors and management because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base. we define roic as nopat, a non-gaap financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by average debt and equity. we define average debt and equity as the average of beginning and ending long-term debt (including current installments) and equity for the most recent twelve-month period.
23
the calculation of roic, together with a reconciliation of nopat to net earnings (the most comparable gaap measure), follows.

additional information for information on accounting pronouncements that have impacted or are expected to materially impact our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.
liquidity and capital resources operating activities. cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, operations and occupancy costs.
net cash provided by operating activities increased $2.2 billion in fiscal 2017 and increased $410 million in fiscal 2016, and primarily reflected an increase in net earnings, excluding changes in working capital and non-cash items from operations. the increase in earnings resulted from higher comparable sales and expense leverage in both fiscal years.
24
cash provided by or used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
investing activities. cash used in investing activities primarily reflected:
•   $1.9 billion of capital expenditures for investments in our business and $374 million cash paid in connection with the acquisitions of compact power and the company store in fiscal 2017;
•   $1.6 billion of capital expenditures for investments in our business in fiscal 2016; and
•   $1.7 billion paid in connection with the acquisition of interline and $1.5 billion of capital expenditures for investments in our business in fiscal 2015.
financing activities. cash used in financing activities primarily reflected:
•   $8.0 billion of share repurchases and $4.2 billion of cash dividends paid, partially offset by $3.3 billion of net proceeds from short- and long-term borrowings in fiscal 2017;
•   $6.9 billion of share repurchases and $3.4 billion of cash dividends paid, partially offset by $2.3 billion of net proceeds from short- and long-term borrowings in fiscal 2016; and
•   $7.0 billion of share repurchases and $3.0 billion of cash dividends paid, partially offset by $4.0 billion of net proceeds from short- and long-term borrowings in fiscal 2015.
cash and cash equivalents at end of year. at january 28, 2018, we had $3.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which $3.2 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. we believe that our current cash position, access to the long-term debt capital markets, and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments, share repurchases, and any required long-term debt payments through the next several fiscal years. in addition, we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing.
debt and derivatives in december 2017, we increased the borrowing capacity of our commercial paper programs from $2.0 billion to $3.0 billion. all of our short-term borrowings in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 were under these commercial paper programs. in connection with these programs, we have back-up credit facilities with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $3.0 billion. in december 2017, we replaced our five-year $2.0 billion credit facility that was scheduled to expire in december 2019, with a new, substantially identical five-year $2.0 billion credit facility that expires in december 2022. in addition, we added a separate 364-day $1.0 billion credit facility that expires in december 2018. at january 28, 2018, we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the credit facilities, and none are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. at january 28, 2018 and january 29, 2017, there were $1.6 billion and $710 million, respectively, of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs. we also issue senior notes from time to time.
we use derivative financial instruments in the management of our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies and interest rates on certain long-term debt. see note 4 and note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt and derivative agreements.
leases we use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers, and store support centers. see note 3 and note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our capital and operating leases.
share repurchases in fiscal 2017, we repurchased 49.5 million shares of our common stock for $8.0 billion through asr agreements and open market transactions. in february 2017, our board of directors authorized a $15.0 billion share repurchase program that replaced the previous authorization. in december 2017, our board of directors authorized a new $15.0 billion share repurchase program that replaced the february 2017 authorization. see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our share repurchases.

off-balance sheet arrangements we have operating leases for a portion of our real estate and other assets that are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates.
merchandise inventories we value the substantial majority of our inventory under the retail inventory method, using the first-in, first-out method, with the remainder of our inventories valued under a cost method. under the retail inventory method, inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. the retail value of our inventory is adjusted as needed to reflect current market conditions. because these adjustments are based on current prevailing market conditions, the value of our inventory approximates the lower of cost or market.
as the valuation under the retail inventory method is based on estimates such as markups, markdowns, and inventory losses (or shrink), there exists an inherent uncertainty in the final determination of inventory cost and gross profit. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood for a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to value our inventory under the retail inventory method. we believe that the retail inventory method provides an inventory valuation which approximates cost and results in valuing our inventory at the lower of cost or market.
impairment of long-lived assets we evaluate our long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, our decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. the evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the
26
lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. the assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated for recoverability by comparing its undiscounted future cash flows with its carrying value. our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, market competition, and inflation.
if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future cash flows, we then measure the asset's fair value to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized. if the resulting fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized. we generally base our estimates of fair market value on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates of the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations. impairments and lease obligation costs on closings and relocations were not material to our consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2017.
self-insurance we have established liabilities for certain losses related to general liability (including product liability), workers' compensation, employee group medical, and automobile claims for which we are self-insured. our self-insured retention or deductible, as applicable, for each claim involving general liability, workers' compensation, and automobile liability is limited to $25 million, $1 million, and $1 million, respectively. we have no stop loss limits for self-insured employee group medical claims. our liabilities represent estimates of the ultimate cost for claims incurred at the balance sheet date. the estimated liabilities are not discounted and are established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. the liabilities are reviewed by management and third-party actuaries on a regular basis to ensure that they are appropriate. while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available, if actual trends, including the severity or frequency of claims, medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums, differ from our estimates, our results of operations could be impacted. actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015.
revenues we recognize revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or when a service is performed. we estimate the liability for sales returns, including the estimated gross profit impact, based on our historical return levels and believe that our estimate for sales returns is a reasonable reflection of future returns.
we defer revenue and the related gross profit for payments received from customers for which the customer has not yet taken possession of merchandise or we have not yet performed the service for the customer. this amount is recorded as deferred revenue. we estimate the gross profit related to deferred revenue using historical rates, which we believe to be a reasonable reflection of future rates. if these estimates significantly differ from actual amounts, our net sales and gross profit could be adversely impacted.
vendor allowances vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and co-op advertising allowances for the promotion of vendors' products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. these vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. we believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors.
volume rebates and certain co-op advertising allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in merchandise inventories and a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold. certain co-op advertising allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors' products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in sg&a.

in the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk that could impact our financial position and results of operations.
foreign currency exchange risk we conduct business outside the u.s. in several currencies including the british pound sterling, euro, indian rupee, japanese yen and philippine peso. the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses. over the next 12 months, our non-u.s. dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized are estimated to be approximately $90 million while our non-u.s. dollar denominated expenses are approximately $300
million, which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of approximately $210 million per year. to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future, our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase. to manage the exposures related to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, we utilize derivative instruments (foreign currency forward contracts). by their nature, all derivative instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of market and credit risk. the market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. we do not believe there is significant risk of loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparties associated with these instruments because these transactions are executed with a major financial institution. further, our policy is to deal with counterparties having a minimum investment grade or better credit rating. credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposures to such counterparties. our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings associated with changes in foreign currency.
as of august 31, 2017, factset maintained foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 75% of its indian rupee exposure through the third quarter of fiscal 2019. the gross notional value of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase indian rupees with u.s. dollars was rs. 3.8 billion.
there were no other outstanding foreign currency forward contracts as of august 31, 2017. a loss on derivatives of
$2.9 million was recorded into operating income in fiscal 2017, compared to a loss of $0.5 million a year ago. the gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts mitigate the variability in operating expenses associated with currency movements. these transactions are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. the changes in fair value for these foreign currency forward contracts are initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently reclassified into operating expenses when the hedged exposure affects earnings. the related cash flow impacts of all of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities.
a sensitivity analysis was performed based on the estimated fair value of all foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at august 31, 2017. if the u.s. dollar had been 10% weaker, the fair value of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts would have increased by $5.4 million, which would have had an immaterial impact on our consolidated balance sheet. such a change in fair value of our financial instruments would be substantially offset by changes in our expense base. had we not had any hedges in place as of august 31, 2017, a hypothetical 10% weaker u.s. dollar against all foreign currencies from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 31, 2017, would result in a decrease in operating income by $20.3 million over the next 12 months. a hypothetical 10% weaker u.s. dollar against all foreign currencies at august 31, 2017 would increase the fair value of total assets by
$69.5 million and equity by $61.9 million.
on june 23, 2016, the uk held a referendum in which british citizens approved an exit from the eu,commonly referred to as "brexit." as a result of the referendum, the global markets and currencies have been adversely impacted, including a sharp decline in the value of the british pound sterling as compared to the u.s. dollar. volatility in exchange rates is expected to continue in the short term as the uk negotiates its exit from the eu. in the longer term, any impact from brexit on us will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations. although it is unknown what the result of those negotiations will be, it is possible that new terms may adversely affect our operations and financial results.

interest rate risk cash and cash equivalents the fair market value of our cash and investments at august 31, 2017, was $227.2 million. our cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and money market funds with original maturities of three months or less and are reported at fair value. our investments consist of certificates of deposits with original maturities greater than three months, but less than one year and, as such, are classified as investments within our consolidated balance sheet. it is anticipated that the fair market value of our cash and investments will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates. preservation of principal is the primary goal of our cash and investment policy. pursuant to our established investment guidelines, we try to achieve high levels of credit quality, liquidity and diversification. our investment guidelines do not permit us to invest in puts, calls, strips, short sales, straddles, options, commodities, precious metals, futures or investments on margin. because we have a restrictive investment policy, our financial exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is expected to remain low. we do not believe that the value or liquidity of our cash and investments have been significantly impacted by current market events.
debt as of august 31, 2017, the fair value of our long-term debt was $575.0 million, which approximated its carrying amount given its floating interest rate basis and was determined based on quoted market prices for debt with a similar maturity. it is anticipated that the fair market value of our debt will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates and we do not believe that the value of our debt has been significantly impacted by current market events. the debt bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to the daily libor rate plus 1.00%. during fiscal 2017 we paid $8.4 million in interest on our outstanding loan amount compared to $3.1 million in the prior year. assuming all terms of our outstanding long-term debt remained the same, a hypothetical 25 basis point change (up or down) in the one-month libor rate would result in a $1.4 million change in our annual interest expense.

management's statement of responsibility for financial statements factset's consolidated financial statements are prepared by management, which is responsible for their fairness, integrity and objectivity. the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and include amounts based on management's estimates and judgments. all financial information in this annual report on form 10-k has been presented on a basis consistent with the information included in the accompanying financial statements.
factset's policies and practices reflect corporate governance initiatives that are compliant with the listing requirements of the new york stock exchange, the nasdaq stock market and the corporate governance requirements of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002. management, with oversight by the company's board of directors, has established and maintains a strong ethical climate so that its affairs are conducted to the highest standards of personal and corporate conduct.
factset maintains accounting systems, including internal accounting controls, designed to provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of financial records and the protection of assets. the concept of reasonable assurance is based on recognition that the cost of a system should not exceed the related benefits. the effectiveness of those systems depends primarily upon the careful selection of financial and other managers, clear delegation of authority and assignment of accountability, inculcation of high business ethics and conflict-of-interest standards, policies and procedures for coordinating the management of corporate resources, and the leadership and commitment of top management. in compliance with the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, factset assessed its internal control over financial reporting as of august 31, 2017, and issued a report (see below).
the audit committee of the board of directors, which consists solely of independent non-employee directors, is responsible for overseeing the functioning of the accounting system and related controls and the preparation of annual financial statements. the audit committee periodically meets with management and the independent accountants to review and evaluate their accounting, auditing and financial reporting activities and responsibilities, including management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting. the independent registered public accounting firm has full and free access to the audit committee and has met with the committee, with and without management present.
management's report on internal control over financial reporting management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for factset. internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
management (with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer) conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of factset's internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control-integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission except for the internal controls of bi-sam technologies, factset digital solutions and vermilion holdings limited which (in aggregate) constituted 4.8% of net assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets) as of august 31, 2017 and 4.5% of revenues for the year then ended. based on this evaluation, management concluded that factset's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of august 31, 2017. ernst & young llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of factset's internal control over financial reporting and has issued a report on factset's internal control over financial reporting, which is included in their report on page 46.

notes to the consolidated financial statements
1. organization and nature of business factset research systems inc. (the "company" or "factset") provides integrated financial information and analytical applications for the global investment community. the company delivers insight and information to financial investment professionals through its analytics, service, content, and technology. by integrating comprehensive datasets and analytics across asset classes with client data, factset supports the workflow of both buy-side and sell-side clients. these professionals include portfolio managers, wealth managers, research and performance analysts, risk managers, research professionals, investment bankers, and fixed income professionals. from streaming real-time data to historical information, including quotes, estimates, news and commentary, factset offers unique and third-party content through desktop, wireless and off-platform solutions. the company's wide application suite offers tools and resources including company and industry analyses, full screening tools, portfolio analysis, risk profiles, alpha-testing, portfolio optimization and research management solutions. the company's revenues are derived from subscriptions to products and services such as workstations, analytics, enterprise data, research management, and trade execution.
2. basis of presentation factset conducts business globally and is managed on a geographic basis. the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. all intercompany activity and balances have been eliminated from the consolidated financial statements.
the company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
significant estimates have been made in areas that include allocation of purchase price to acquired assets and liabilities, stock-based compensation, income taxes, accrued compensation, valuation of goodwill, and useful lives and valuation of fixed and intangible assets. the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. actual results could differ from those estimates.
the company has evaluated subsequent events through the date that the financial statements were issued.
3. summary of significant accounting policies the significant accounting policies of the company and its subsidiaries are summarized below.
revenue recognition the majority of the company's revenues are derived from subscriptions to services such as workstations (also referred to as users), content and applications. the majority of clients are invoiced monthly to reflect the actual services provided. the remaining clients are invoiced quarterly, annually or biannually in advance. subscription revenue is earned each month as the service is rendered to clients on a monthly basis. factset recognizes revenue when the client subscribes to factset services, the service has been rendered and earned during the month, the amount of the subscription is fixed or determinable based on established rates quoted on an annualized basis and collectability is reasonably assured. a provision for billing adjustments and cancellation of services is estimated and accounted for as a reduction to revenue, with a corresponding reduction to accounts receivable.
accounts receivable and deferred fees amounts that have been earned but not yet paid are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as accounts receivable, net of reserves. amounts invoiced in advance of client payments that are in excess of earned subscription revenues are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as deferred fees. as of august 31, 2017, the amount of accounts receivable that was unbilled totaled $5.3 million, which was billed in fiscal 2018.
the company calculates its receivable reserve through analyzing aged client receivables, reviewing the recent history of client receivable write-offs and understanding general market and economic conditions. in accordance with this policy, a receivable reserve of $2.7 million and $1.5 million was recorded as of august 31, 2017 and
2016, respectively, within the consolidated balance sheets as a reduction to accounts receivable.
53
cost of services cost of services is comprised of compensation for company employees within the content collection, consulting, product development, software and systems engineering groups in addition to data costs, computer maintenance and depreciation expenses, amortization of identifiable intangible assets, and client-related communication costs.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses include compensation for the sales and various other support and administrative departments in addition to travel and entertainment expenses, marketing costs, rent, amortization of leasehold improvements, depreciation of furniture and fixtures, office expenses, professional fees and other miscellaneous expenses.
research and product development costs factset does not have a separate research and product development department, but rather the product development and engineering departments work closely with the sales function to identify areas of improvement with the goal of providing increased value to clients. as such, research and product development costs relate to the salary and benefits for the company's product development, software engineering and technical support staff and, as such, these costs are expensed when incurred within cost of services as employee compensation. the company expects to allocate a similar percentage of its workforce in future years in order to continue to develop new products and enhancements, respond quickly to market changes and meet the needs of its clients efficiently. factset incurred
$215.0 million of research and product development costs during fiscal 2017, which was comparable to its spend on similar development during fiscal years 2016 and 2015 respectively.
earnings per share basic earnings per share ("eps") is computed by dividing net income by the number of weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. diluted eps is computed by dividing net income by the number of weighted average common shares outstanding during the period increased by the dilutive effect of potential common shares outstanding during the period. the number of potential common shares outstanding has been determined in accordance with the treasury stock method to the extent they are dilutive. common share equivalents consist of common shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding share-based compensation awards, including employee stock options and restricted stock. under the treasury stock method, the exercise price paid by the optionee, future stock-based compensation expense that the company has not yet recognized and the amount of tax benefits that would be recorded in additional paid-in capital ("apic") when the award becomes deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.
comprehensive income (loss)
the company discloses comprehensive income (loss) in accordance with applicable standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income (loss) in a set of financial statements. comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in net assets of a business enterprise during a period from transactions generated from non-owner sources. it includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners.
fair value measures fair value is definedas the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability
(i.e., the "exit price") in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. in determining fair value, the use of various valuation methodologies, including market, income and cost approaches is permissible. the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. the accounting guidance for fair value measurements establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. there are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value based on the reliability of inputs. a financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. the company's cash equivalents are classified as level 1 while the company's derivative instruments (foreign exchange forward contracts) and certificates of deposit are classified as level 2. there were no level 3 assets or liabilities held by factset as of august 31, 2017 or 2016.
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and corporate money market funds withoriginal maturities of three months or less and are reported at fair value. the company's corporate money market funds are traded in an active market and the net asset value of each fund on the last day of the quarter is used to determine its fair value.
54
investments investments consist of certificates of deposits with original maturities greater than three months, but less thanone year and, as such, are classified as investments (short-term) on the consolidated balance sheets. these certificates of deposit are held for investment and are not debt securities. investments also include mutual funds, which factset may withdraw from at any time, as such, they are presented as investments (short-term) on the consolidated balance sheets. the company's investments are associated with its purchase of certificates of deposits in india with maturities of less than twelve months from the date of purchase. interest income earned from these investments during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $1.6 million, $1.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively. the company's cash, cash equivalents and investments portfolio did not experience any realized or unrealized losses as a result of counterparty credit risk or ratings change during fiscal 2017 and 2016.
property, equipment and leasehold improvements property, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
computers and related equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of three years. furniture and fixtures are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of seven years. leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases or estimated useful lives of the improvements, whichever period is shorter. repairs and maintenance expenditures, which are not considered leasehold improvements and do not extend the useful life of the property and equipment, are expensed as incurred.
the company performs a test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an individual asset or asset group may not be recoverable. should projected undiscounted future cash flows be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment charge reducing the carrying amount to fair value is required. fair value is determined based on the most appropriate valuation technique, including discounted cash flows.
goodwill the company is required to test goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators occur. goodwill is tested for impairment based on the present value of discounted cash flows, and, if impaired, written down to fair value based on discounted cash flows. factset has three reporting units, which are consistent with the operating segments reported as there is no discrete financial information available for the subsidiaries within each operating segment. the reporting units evaluated for potential impairment were the u.s., europe and asia pacific, which reflect the level of internal reporting the company uses to manage its business and operations.
the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, consistent with the timing of previous years, and concluded that there was no impairment, with the fair value of each of the company's reporting units significantly exceeding carrying value.
intangible assets factset's identifiable intangible assets consist of acquired content databases, client relationships, software technology, non-compete agreements and trade names resulting from acquisitions, which have been fully integrated into the company's operations. depending on the nature of the intangible asset, the identifiable intangible assets are amortized on either a straight-line or an accelerated basis using estimated useful lives ranging between two and twenty years. the remaining useful lives of intangible assets subject to amortization are evaluated quarterly to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. if the estimate of the remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. these intangible assets have no assigned residual values. intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. measurement of any impairment loss for intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. no indicators of impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the fiscal years presented.
accrued liabilities accrued liabilities include estimates relating to employee compensation, operating expenses and tax liabilities.
approximately 15% of the company's employee incentive compensation programs are discretionary. at the end of each fiscal year, factset conducts a final review of both company and individual performance within each department to determine the amount of discretionary employee compensation. the company also reviews compensation throughout the year to determine how overall performance tracks against management's expectations. management takes these and other factors, including historical performance, into account in reviewing accrued compensation estimates quarterly and adjusting accrual rates as appropriate. the amount of the variable employee compensation recorded within accrued compensation as of august 31, 2017 and 2016, was $39.2million and $38.2 million, respectively.
55
derivative instruments factset conducts business outside the u.s. in several currencies including the indian rupee, philippine peso, british pound sterling, euro and japanese yen. as such, it is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the u.s. dollar. the company utilizes derivative instruments (foreign currency forward contracts)
to manage the exposures related to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency. the company does not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes. in designing a specific hedging approach, factset considers several factors, including offsetting exposures, significance of exposures, forecasting risk and potential effectiveness of the hedge. these transactions are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. the changes in fair value for these foreign currency forward contracts are initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss ("aocl") and subsequently reclassified into operating expenses when the hedged exposure affects earnings. the gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts mitigate the variability in operating expenses associated with currency movements. all derivatives are assessed for effectiveness at each reporting period.
foreign currency translation certain wholly owned subsidiaries within the european and asia pacific segments operate under a functional currency different from the u.s. dollar, such as the british pound sterling, euro, japanese yen, indian rupee and philippine peso. the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses.
translation gains and losses that arise from translating assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign operations are recorded in aocl as a component of stockholders' equity. the accumulated foreign currency translation loss totaled $38.5 million and $67.3 million at august 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
income and deferred taxes income tax expense is based on taxable income determined in accordance with currently enacted laws and tax rates.
deferred income taxes are recorded for the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. factset recognizes the financial effect of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the tax position will prevail upon tax examination, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position as of the reporting date. otherwise, no benefit or expense can be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. the tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. additionally, factset accrues interest on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws. interest is classified as income tax expense in the financial statements.
as of august 31, 2017, the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling $11.5 million, including $1.5
million of accrued interest, recorded as taxes payable(non-current) on the consolidated balance sheet.
stock-based compensation accounting guidance requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including stock options, restricted stock and common shares acquired under employee stock purchases based on estimated fair values of the share awards that are scheduled to vest during the period. factset uses the straight-line attribution method for all awards with graded vesting features and service conditions only. under this method, the amount of compensation expense that is recognized on any date is at least equal to the vested portion of the award on that date. for all stock-based awards with performance conditions, the graded vesting attribution method is used by the company to determine the monthly stock-based compensation expense over the applicable vesting periods.
as stock-based compensation expense recognized is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. forfeitures are estimated based primarily on historical experience. windfall tax benefits, defined as tax deductions that exceed recorded stock-based compensation, are classified as cash inflows from financing activities.
performance-based stock options require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving company performance targets on a quarterly basis. the number of performance-based options that vest will be predicated on the company achieving certain performance levels. a change in the financial performance levels the company achieves could result in changes to factset's current estimate of the vesting percentage and related stock-
based compensation.
56
treasury stock the company accounts for repurchased common stock under the cost method and includes such treasury stock as a component of its stockholders' equity. at the time treasury stock retirement is approved by factset's board of directors, the company's accounting policy is to deduct its par value from common stock, reduce apic by the amount recorded in apic when the stock was originally issued and any remaining excess of cost as a deduction from retained earnings.
operating leases the company conducts all of its operations in leased facilities which have minimum lease obligations under non-
cancelable operating leases. certain of these leases contain rent escalations based on specified percentages. most of the leases contain renewal options and require payments for taxes, insurance and maintenance. rent expense is charged to operations as incurred except for escalating rents, which are charged to operations on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. lease incentives, relating to allowances provided by landlords, are amortized over the term of the lease as a reduction of rent expense. costs associated with acquiring a subtenant, including broker commissions and tenant allowances, are amortized over the sublease term as a reduction of sublease income.
business combinations the company records acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. all of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies and contingent consideration are recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date. the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. acquisition-related expenses and restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.
concentrations of risk cash and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions. deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions with reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk. the company seeks to mitigate its credit risks by spreading such risks across multiple counterparties and monitoring the risk profiles of these counterparties.
new accounting standards or updates recently adopted as of the beginning of fiscal 2017, factset implemented all applicable new accounting standards and updates issued by the financial accounting standards board("fasb") that were in effect. there were no new standards or updates adopted during the last three fiscal years that had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition in may 2014 and july 2015, the fasb issued accounting standard updates which provide clarified principles for recognizing revenue arising from contracts with clients and supersede most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. the core principle of the revenue model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to clients in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. these accounting standard updates will be effective for factset beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, with early adoption in fiscal 2018
permitted and allow for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption. the company is currently evaluating the impact of these accounting standard updates on its consolidated financial statements including the method of adoption.
balance sheet classification of deferred taxes in november 2015, the fasb issued an accounting standard update to simplify the presentation of deferred taxes on the balance sheet. the accounting standard update will require an entity to present all deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as non-current on the balance sheet. under the current guidance, entities are required to separately present deferred taxes as current or non-current. netting deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities by tax jurisdiction will still be required under the new guidance. this guidance is effective for factset beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. the accounting standard update is a change in balance sheet presentation only and, as such, the company does not believe this new accounting standard update will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements
57
recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities in january 2016, the fasb issued an accounting standard update to amend its current guidance on the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments. the accounting standard update significantly revises an entity's accounting related to the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. this guidance also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. this guidance will be effective for factset beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. the company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its consolidated financial statements.
leases in february 2016, the fasb issued an accounting standard update related to accounting for leases. the guidance introduces a lessee model that requires most leases to be reported on the balance sheet. the accounting standard update aligns many of the underlying principles of the new lessor model with those in the fasb's new revenue recognition standard. the guidance also eliminates the requirement in current u.s. gaap for an entity to use bright-line tests in determining lease classification. this accounting standard update will be effective for factset beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, with early adoption in fiscal 2019 permitted. the company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its consolidated financial statements.
share-based payments in march 2016, the fasb issued an accounting standard update which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flow. this accounting standard update will be effective for factset beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. the company believes that the adoption of this accounting standard will increase the volatility within our provision for income taxes, as all excess tax benefits or deficiencies related to share-based payments that were previously reported within equity will now be recognized in the statement of income. in addition, excess tax benefits were historically reflected as a financing activity in the statements of cash flows, and after adoption, will be included within operating activities. share-
based payment expense will continue to reflect estimated forfeitures of share-based payment awards. the company is unable to quantify the impact on the adoption of this standard in fiscal 2018 due to the amount of variables that impact the calculation of the excess tax benefits, including the future stock price of factset and the volume of employee stock option exercises.
inmay 2017, the fasb issued an accounting standard update, which amends the scope of modification accounting for share-based payment arrangements. the guidance focuses on changes to the terms or conditions of share-based payment awards that would require the application of modification accounting and specifies that an entity would not apply modification accounting if the fair value, vesting conditions and classification of the awards are the same immediately before and after the modification. this accounting standard update will be effective for factset beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, with early adoption permitted. the company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its consolidated financial statements.
cash flow simplification in august 2016, the fasb issued anaccounting standard update which simplifies how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. this includes revised guidance on the cash flow classification of debt prepayments and debt extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination and distributions received from equity method investments. the guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice across all industries. this accounting standard update will be effective for factset beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. the company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its consolidated financial statements.
income taxes on intra-entity transfers of assets in october 2016, the fasb issued an accounting standard update which removes the prohibition against the immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. the guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice related to the tax consequences of certain types of intra-entity asset transfers, particularly those involving intellectual property. this accounting standard update will be effective for factset beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. the company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its consolidated financial statements.
goodwill impairment test in january 2017, the fasb issued an accounting standard update which removes the requirement for companies to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount as part of step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. a goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. this accounting standard update will be effective for factset beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, with early adoption permitted for any impairment tests performed after january 1, 2017 and is not expected to have a material impact on the company.
58
hedge accounting simplification in august 2017, the fasb issued an accounting standard update to reduce the complexity of and simplify the application of hedging accounting. the guidance refines and expands hedge accounting for both financial and nonfinancial risk components, eliminates the need to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness, and aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and the hedged item in the financial statements. this guidance will be effective for factset beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted. the company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its consolidated financial statements.
no other new accounting pronouncements issued or effective as of august 31, 2017, have had or are expected to have an impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.
4. fair value measures fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability
(i.e., the "exit price") in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. in determining fair value, the use of various valuation methodologies, including market, income and cost approaches is permissible. the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.
fair value hierarchy the accounting guidance for fair value measurements establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. there are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value based on the reliability of inputs. a financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. the company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.
factset has categorized its cash equivalents, investments and derivatives within the fair value hierarchy as follows:
level 1- applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. these level 1 assets and liabilities include factset's corporate money market funds that are classified as cash equivalents.
level 2- applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. the company's certificates of deposit and derivative instruments are classified as level 2.
level 3- applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. there were no level 3 assets or liabilities held by factset as of august 31, 2017 or 2016.
(a ) assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis the following tables shows by level within the fair value hierarchy the company's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at august 31, 2017 and 2016:

value the company's corporate money market funds are traded in an active market and the net asset value of each
(1)  fund on the last day of the quarter is used to determine its fair value. as such, the company's corporate money market funds are classified as level 1 and included in cash and cash equivalents within the consolidated balance sheets.
the company's mutual funds have a fair value based on the fair value of the underlying investments held by
(2)  the mutual funds allocated to each share of the mutual fund using a net asset value approach. the fair value of the underlying investments is based on observable inputs. as such, the company's mutual funds are classified as level 2 and are classified as investments (short-term) on the consolidated balance sheets.
the company's certificates of deposit held for investment are not debt securities and are classified as
(3)  level 2. these certificates of deposit have original maturities greater than three months, but less than one year and, as such, are classified as investments (short-term) within the consolidated balance sheets.
the company utilizes the income approach to measure fair value for its derivative instruments (foreign
(4)  exchange forward contracts). the income approach uses pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as spot, forward and interest rates, as well as credit default swap spreads and therefore are classified as level 2.
the company did not have any transfers between level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements during the periods presented.
(b ) assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis certain assets, including goodwill and intangible assets, and liabilities, are measured at fair value on a non-
recurring basis; that is, the assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances such as when they are deemed to be other-than-
temporarily impaired. the fair values of these non-financial assets and liabilities are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. an impairment charge is recorded when the cost exceeds its fair value, based upon the results of such valuations. during fiscal 2017 and 2016, no fair value adjustments or material fair value measurements were required for the company's non-financial assets or liabilities.
(c) assets and liabilities measured at fair value for discl osure purposes only as of august31, 2017 and 2016, the fair value of the company's long-term debt was $575.0 million and $300.0
million, respectively, which approximated its carrying amount given its floating interest rate basis. the fair value of the company's long-term debt was determined based on quoted market prices for debt with a similar maturity, and thus categorized as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
5. derivative instruments cash flow hedges factset conducts business outside the u.s. in several currencies including the british pound sterling, euro, indian rupee, japanese yen and philippine peso. as such, it is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the u.s. dollar. the company utilizes derivative instruments (foreign currency forward contracts) to manage the exposures related to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency. the company does not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes. in designing a specific hedging approach, factset considered several factors, including offsetting exposures, the significance of exposures, the forecasting of risk and the potential effectiveness of the hedge. the gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts offset the variability in operating expenses associated with currency movements. the changes in fair value for these foreign currency forward contracts are initially reported as a component of aocl and subsequently reclassified into operating expenses when the hedged exposure affects earnings. there was no discontinuance of cash flow hedges during fiscal 2017 or 2016, and as such, no corresponding gains or losses related to changes in the value of the company's contracts were reclassified into earnings prior to settlement.
as of august 31, 2017, factset maintained foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 75% of its indian rupee exposure through the third quarter of fiscal 2019.

counterparty credit risk as a result of the use of derivative instruments, the company is exposed to counterparty credit risk. factset has incorporated counterparty risk into the fair value of its derivative assets and its own credit risk into the value of the company's derivative liabilities. factset calculates credit risk from observable data related to credit default swaps ("cds") as quoted by publicly available information. counterparty risk is represented by cds spreads related to the senior secured debt of the respective bank with whom factset has executed these derivative transactions. because cds spread information is not available for factset, the company's credit risk is determined based on using a simple average of cds spreads for peer companies. to mitigate counterparty credit risk, factset enters into contracts with large financial institutions. the company regularly reviews its credit exposure balances as well as the creditworthiness of the counterparties. the company does not expect any losses as a result of default of its counterparties.

7. segment information operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that engage in business activities from which they may earn revenues and incur expenses, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the enterprise's chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. financial information at the operating segment level is reviewed jointly by the chief executive officer ("ceo") and senior management. senior management consists of executives who directly report to the ceo, comprising the chief financial officer, chief operating officer, global head of sales and client solutions, general counsel, and chief human resources officer. senior management, along with the ceo, constitute factset's chief operating decision making group ("codmg") and is responsible for making decisions about resources allocated among the operating segments based on actual results.
factset's operating segments are aligned with how the company, including its codmg, manages the business and the demographic markets in which factset serves. the company's internal financial reporting structure is based on three segments; the u.s., europe and asia pacific. factset believes this alignment helps it better manage the business and view the markets the company serves, which are centered on providing integrated global financial and economic information. sales, consulting, data collection, product development and software engineering are the primary functional groups within the u.s., europe and asia pacific segments that provide global financial and economic information to investment managers, investment banks and other financial services professionals. the u.s. segment services investment professionals including financial institutions throughout the americas. the european and asia pacific segments service investment professionals located throughout europe and the asia pacific region, respectively. the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the note 3, summary of significant accounting policies.
the european segment maintains office locations in bulgaria, dubai, england, france, germany, italy, latvia, the netherlands, spain, and switzerland. the asia pacific segment has office locations in australia, hong kong, india, japan, and singapore. segment revenues reflect direct sales to clients based in their respective geographic locations. there are no intersegment or intercompany sales of factset services. each segment records compensation expense, including stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of furniture and fixtures, amortization of leasehold improvements, communication costs, professional fees, rent expense, travel, marketing, office and other direct expenses.
62
expenditures associated with the company's data centers, third party data costs and corporate headquarters charges are recorded by the u.s. segment and are not allocated to the other segments. the content collection centers located in india and the philippines benefit all of the company's operating segments and thus the expenses incurred at these locations are allocated to each segment based on a percentage of revenues. of the total $707.6 million of goodwill reported by the company at august 31, 2017, 54% was recorded in the u.s. segment, 45% in the european segment and the remaining 1% in the asia pacific segment.
the following reflects the results of operations of the segments consistent with the company's management system.
these results are used, in part, by management, both in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the segments.

8. business combinations bisam on march 17, 2017, factset acquired bi-sam technologies ("bisam") for a total purchase price of $217.6 million.
bisam is a global provider of portfolio performance and attribution, multi-asset risk, gips composites management and reporting. bisam's product offerings include b-one, bisam's cross-asset solution, which will serve as a complement to both factset's portfolio analytics suite and client reporting solutions, and cognity, which enhances factset's risk analysis for derivatives and quantitative portfolio construction. these factors contributed to a purchase price in excess of fair value of bisam's net tangible and intangible assets, leading to the recognition of goodwill. at the time of acquisition, bisam employed over 160 employees based primarily in its new york, boston, paris, london and sofia offices. total transaction costs related to the acquisition were $3.2 million in fiscal
2017 and were recorded within selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expenses in the consolidated statements of income.
allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was finalized during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. there were no significant adjustments between the preliminary and final allocation. the total purchase price was allocated to bisam's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition.

goodwill is not amortized as it is estimated to have an indefinite life. at least annually, the company is required to test goodwill at the reporting unit level for potential impairment, and, if impaired, write down to fair value based on the present value of discounted cash flows. the company's reporting units evaluated for potential impairment were the u.s., europe and asia pacific, which reflect the level of internal reporting the company uses to manage its business and operations. the three reporting units are consistent with the operating segments reported as there is no discrete financial information available for the subsidiaries within each operating segment. the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, consistent with the timing of previous years, at which time it was determined that there was no impairment, with the fair value of each of the company's reporting units significantly exceeding carrying value. during fiscal 2017
the company acquired goodwill of $235.4 million representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets from acquisitions completed in fiscal 2017.
11. intangible assets factset's identifiable intangible assets consist of acquired content databases, client relationships, software technology, non-compete agreements and trade names resulting from previous acquisitions, which have been fully integrated into the company's operations. the weighted average useful life of the company's acquired intangible assets at august 31, 2017 was 11.5 years. the company amortizes intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which are evaluated quarterly to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. there were no changes to the estimate of the remaining useful lives during fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015. amortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment, if indicators are present, based on undiscounted cash flows, and, if impaired, written down to fair value based on discounted cash flows. no impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented. the intangible assets have no assigned residual values.

performance-based stock options performance-based stock options require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving company performance targets. the number of performance-based options that vest will be predicated on the company achieving performance levels during the measurement period subsequent to the date of grant. dependent on the financial performance levels attained by factset, a percentage of the performance-based stock options will vest to the grantees of those stock options. however, there is no current guarantee that such options will vest in whole or in part.
february 2015 performance-based option grant review in connection with the acquisition of code red, factset granted 137,522 performance-based stock options during the second quarter of fiscal 2015. of the total amount granted, 68,761 performance-based options were eligible to vest if certain code red asv and operating margin targets were achieved over a two-year measurement period ending february 28, 2017. at the conclusion of the measurement period, 70% of the options were deemed eligible to vest, with the remaining options being forfeited. the option holders must remain employed by factset through february 28,

june 2017 performance-based option grant review in connection with the acquisition of bisam, factset granted 206,417 performance-based stock options in june 2017.
these performance-based options will vest 40% on the second anniversary date of the grant and 20% on each subsequent anniversary date if certain bisam revenue and operating income targets are achieved by march 31, 2019.
the option holders must also remain employed by factset for the options to be eligible to vest. as of august 31,
2017, factset does not believe these growth targets are probable of being achieved, and as such, no stock-based compensation expense is expected to be recognized in connection with these performance-based options. a change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by bisam in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense:

price the risk-free interest rate assumption for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the u.s.
treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. expected volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of the company's stock and implied volatilities of publicly traded options to buy factset common stock with contractual terms closest to the expected life of options granted to employees. the approach to utilize a mix of historical and implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on the company's stock and the company's assessment that a combination of implied volatility and historical volatility is best representative of future stock price trends. the company uses historical data to estimate option exercises and employee termination within the valuation model. the dividend yield assumption is based on the company's history and expectation of dividend payouts. the expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and is a derived output of the binomial model. the binomial model estimates employees exercise behavior based on the option's remaining vested life and the extent to which the option is in-the-money. the binomial model estimates the probability of exercise as a function of these two variables based on the entire history of exercises and cancellations of all past option grants made by the company.
non-employee director stock option fair value determinations the 2008 non-employee directors' stock option plan (the "directors' plan") provides for the grant of share-based awards, including stock options, to non-employee directors of factset. a total of 250,000 shares of factset common stock have been reserved for issuance under the directors' plan. the expiration date of the directors' plan is december 1, 2018.
the company utilizes the black-scholes model to estimate the fair value of new non-employee director stock option grants. the company's determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant is affected by the company's stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of variables. these variables include, but are not limited to the company's expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, interest rates, option forfeitures and employee stock option exercise behaviors.

fiscal 2017
on january 13, 2017, factset granted 23,846 stock options to the company's non-employee directors, including one-
time new director grants of 2,104 for both malcolm frank and sheila b. jordan, who were elected to factset's board of directors on december 20, 2016. all of the options granted on january 13, 2017, have a weighted average estimated fair value of $35.65 per share, using the black-scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:
risk-free interest rate    1.95  %
expected life (years)       5.4
expected volatility        22.7  %
dividend yield             1.24  %

2015. all of the options granted on january 15, 2016, have a weighted average estimated fair value of $31.03 per share, using the black-scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:
risk-free interest rate    1.62  %
expected life (years)       5.4
expected volatility        23.0  %
dividend yield             1.05  %
fiscal 2015
on january 15, 2015, factset granted 13,842 stock options to the company's non-employee directors at a weighted average estimated fair value of $28.18 per share, using the black-scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:
risk-free interest rate    1.45  %
expected life (years)       5.4
expected volatility          23  %
dividend yield             1.30  %
restricted stock fair value determinations restricted stock granted to employees entitle the holder to shares of common stock as the award vests over time, but not to dividends declared on the underlying shares while the restricted stock is unvested. the grant date fair value of restricted stock awards are measured by reducing the grant date price of factset's share by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the underlying stock during the requisite service period, discounted at the appropriate risk-free interest rate. restricted stock awards are amortized to expense over the vesting period.

employee stock purchase plan fair value determinations during fiscal 2017, employees purchased 75,372 shares at a weighted average price of $136.34 compared to 73,072
shares at a weighted average price of $131.14 in fiscal 2016 and 63,265 shares at a weighted average price of
$122.76 in fiscal 2015. stock-based compensation expense recorded during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 relating to the employee stock purchase plan was $2.1 million, $1.9 million and $1.5 million, respectively.
the company uses the black-scholes model to calculate the estimated fair value for the employee stock purchase plan. the weighted average estimated fair value of employee stock purchase plan grants during fiscal years 2017,
2016 and 2015, were $28.16, $26.87 and $24.05 per share, respectively, with the following weighted average assumptions:
2017       2016       2015
risk-free interest rate    0.69  %    0.22  %    0.03  %

dividend yield             1.25  %    1.18  %    1.15  %
accuracy of fair value estimates the company is responsible for determining the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of its share-based payment awards. the company's determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by the company's stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. these variables include, but are not limited to the company's expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, interest rates, option forfeiture rates and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. option-pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable.

no u.s. income taxes have been provided on filing-basis undistributed foreign earnings and profits of $223.6
million as of august 31, 2017, as factset plans to permanently reinvest these amounts and use the earnings to fund non-u.s. operations and working capital needs as well as facilities overseas. these needs include, but are not limited to, capital expenditures and acquisitions intended to further factset's global growth strategy. at each reporting period, factset assesses its position with regard to undistributed foreign earnings of its subsidiaries.
to the extent that earnings can no longer be indefinitely reinvested, the company will accrue the tax impact, if any, attributable to those earnings, including the impact of foreign tax credits, at such time. if such earnings are repatriated, additional tax expense may result, although the flexibility inherent in the u.s. internal revenue code may permit the ultimate distribution to be tax-free depending on the nature of the distribution. therefore the company does not believe it is practicable to estimate, with reasonable accuracy, the hypothetical amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability on its undistributed foreign earnings given the many factors and assumptions necessary to estimate the amount of the federal income tax that may be payable in the future on the undistributed earnings.
unrecognized tax positions applicable accounting guidance prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, classification and disclosure of uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. a company can recognize the financial effect of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the tax position will prevail upon tax examination, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. otherwise, no benefit or expense can be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. the tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. additionally, companies are required to accrue interest on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws.
as of august 31, 2017, the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling $11.5 million, including $1.5
million of accrued interest, recorded as taxes payable (non-current) on the consolidated balance sheet. as of august 31, 2016, the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling $8.8 million, including $1.3 million of accrued interest, recorded as taxes payable (non-current) on the consolidated balance sheet. the company recognizes interest and penalty charges related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense, which is consistent with the recognition in prior reporting periods. the company recognized interest charges of less than $0.2 million in each of the fiscal years ended august 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
79
unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions taken on tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements. when applicable, the company adjusts the previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results when the position is ultimately settled. the company regularly engages in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. it is reasonably possible that certain federal, foreign, and state tax matters may be concluded in the next 12 months. however, factset has no reason to believe that such audits will result in the payment of additional taxes and/or penalties that would have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial position, beyond current estimates.
any changes in accounting estimates resulting from new developments with respect to uncertain tax positions will be recorded as appropriate. the company does not currently anticipate that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change within the next 12 months.

on march 17, 2017, the company entered into a credit agreement (the "2017 credit agreement") between factset, as the borrower, and pnc bank, national association ("pnc"), as the administrative agent and lender. the 2017 credit agreement provides for a $575.0 million revolving credit facility (the "2017 revolving credit facility"). factset may request borrowings under the 2017 revolving credit facility until its maturity date of march 17, 2020. the 2017
credit agreement also allows factset, subject to certain requirements, to arrange for additional borrowings with pnc for an aggregate amount of up to $225.0 million, provided that any such request for additional borrowings must be in a minimum amount of $25.0 million. borrowings under the loan bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to the daily libor rate plus 1.00%. interest on the loan outstanding is payable quarterly in arrears and on the maturity date. there are no prepayment penalties if the company elects to prepay the outstanding loan amounts prior to the scheduled maturity date. the principal balance is payable in full on the maturity date.
80
in conjunction with factset's entrance into the 2017 credit agreement, the company borrowed $575.0 million in the form of a libor rate loan under the 2017 revolving credit facility and retired the outstanding debt under its previous credit agreement between factset, as the borrower, and bank of america, n.a., as the lender. the total principal amount of the debt outstanding at the time of retirement was $365.0 million and there were no prepayment penalties. proceeds from the 2017 revolving credit facility were also used to fund factset's acquisition of bisam.
all outstanding loan amounts are reported as long-term debtwithin the consolidated balance sheet at august 31,
2017. during fiscal 2017 and 2016, we paid approximately $8.4 million and $3.1 million in interest on its outstanding debt amounts, respectively. the principal balance is payable in full on the maturity date.
as of august 31, 2017, no commitment fee was owed by factset since it borrowed the full amount under the 2017
credit agreement. in fiscal 2017, factset incurred approximately $0.4 million in legal costs to draft and review the 2017 credit agreement. these costs were capitalized as loan origination fees and are amortized into interest expense over the term of the loan using the effective interest method.
the 2017credit agreement contained covenants restricting certain factset activities, which are usual and customary for this type of loan.
in addition, the 2017 credit agreement required that factset maintain a consolidated leverage ratio, as measured by total funded debt/ebitda below a specified level as of the end of each fiscal quarter. the company was in compliance with all of the covenants of the 2017 credit agreement as of august 31, 2017.
19. commitments and contingencies commitments represent obligations, such as those for future purchases of goods or services that are not yet recorded on the balance sheet as liabilities. factset records liabilities for commitments when incurred (i.e., when the goods or services are received).
lease commitments at august 31, 2017, factset leased approximately 1,143,000 square feet of office space under various non-cancelable operating leases which expire on various dates through 2031. total minimum rental payments associated with the leases are recorded as rent expense (a component of selling, general & administrativeexpense) on a straight-line basis over the periods of the respective non-cancelable lease terms. future minimum commitments for the company's operating leases in place as of august 31, 2017 are as follows:

during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, rent expense (including operating costs) for all operating leases amounted to
$48.4 million, $43.2 million and $38.6 million, respectively. at august 31, 2017 and 2016, deferred rent reported within the consolidated balance sheets totaled $37.4 million and $34.4 million, of which $33.5 million and $31.2
million, respectively, was reported as a non-current liability within the line item deferred rent and other non-
current liabilities.
approximately $1.9 million of standby letters of credit have been issued during the ordinary course of business in connection with the company's current leased office space as of august 31, 2017. these standby letters of credit contain covenants that, among other things, require factset to maintain minimum levels of consolidated net worth and certain leverage and fixed charge ratios. as of august 31, 2017 and 2016, factset was in compliance with all covenants contained in the standby letters of credit.

purchase commitments with suppliers purchase obligations represent payments due in future periods in respect of commitments to the company's various data vendors as well as commitments to purchase goods and services such as telecommunication and computer maintenance services. these purchase commitments are agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on factset and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. as of august 31, 2017 and 2016, the company had total purchase commitments with suppliers of $81.0 million and $67.5 million, respectively.
contingencies legal matters factset accrues non income-tax liabilities for contingencies when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts canbe reasonably estimated, while contingent gains are recognized only when realized. the company is subject to legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, including intellectual property litigation. based on information available at august 31, 2017, factset's management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these unresolved matters against the company, individually or in the aggregate, is likely to have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated financial position, its results of operations or its cash flows.
income taxes uncertain income tax positions are accounted for in accordance with applicable accounting guidance (see note 17).
factset is currently under audit by tax authorities and has reserved for potential adjustments to its provision for income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated settlements with, these tax authorities. the company believes that the final outcome of these examinations or settlements will not have a material effect on its results of operations. if events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of tax benefits in the period factset determines the liabilities are no longer necessary. if the company's estimates of the federal, state, and foreign income tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.
indemnifications as permitted or required under delaware law and to themaximum extent allowable under that law, factset has certain obligations to indemnify its current and former officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at factset's request in such capacity. these indemnification obligations are valid as long as the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the company, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. the maximum potential amount of future payments factset could be required to make under these indemnification obligations is unlimited; however, factset has a director and officer insurance policy that it believes mitigates factset's exposure and may enable factset to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. the company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is immaterial.
20. risks and concentrations of credit risk financial risk management foreign currency exchange risk the company is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which could affect its operating results, financial position and cash flows. the company's primary foreign currency market exposures include the british pound sterling, euro, japanese yen, indian rupee and philippine peso. to the extent that factset's international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future, its exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase. factset manages its exposure to foreign currency exchange risk through its regular operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. these derivative financial instruments are utilized to hedge currency exposures as well as to reduce earnings volatility resulting from shifts in market rates. factset only enters into foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposures. the fair market values of all the company's derivative contracts change with fluctuations in currency rates and are designed so that any changes in their values are offset by changes in the values of the underlying exposures. see note 5, derivative instruments, for additional analysis of the company's foreign currency exchange rate risk.

interest rate risk cash and cash equivalents- the fair market value of factset's cash and investments at august 31, 2017 was $227.2
million. the company's cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and money market funds with original maturities of three months or less and are reported at fair value. the company's investments consist of certificates of deposits with original maturities greater than three months, but less than one year and, as such, are classified as investments within the consolidated balance sheet. it is anticipated that the fair market value of its cash and investments will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates.
preservation of principal is the primary goal of factset's cash and investment policy. pursuant to established investment guidelines, the company tries to achieve high levels of credit quality, liquidity and diversification.
its investment guidelines do not permit factset to invest in puts, calls, strips, short sales, straddles, options, commodities, precious metals, futures or investments on margin. because the company has a restrictive investment policy, its financial exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is expected to remain low. the company does not believe that the value or liquidity of its cash and investments have been significantly impacted by current market events.
debt- as of august 31, 2017, the fair value of factset's long-term debt was $575.0 million, which approximated its carrying amount and was determined based on quoted market prices for debt with a similar maturity. it is anticipated that the fair market value of factset's debt will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates and it does not believe that the value of its debt has been significantly impacted by current market events. the debt bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to the daily libor rate plus 1.00%. during the years ended august 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded interest expense of $8.4 million and $3.1
million in interest on our outstanding debt amounts, respectively. assuming all terms of the company's outstanding long-term debt remained the same, a hypothetical 25 basis point change (up or down) in the one-month libor rate would result in a $1.4 million change in its annual interest expense.
current market events have not required the company to modify materially or change its financial risk management strategies with respect to its exposures to foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk.
concentrations of credit risk cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents are primarily maintained with two financial institutions. deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions with reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk. the company seeks to mitigate its credit risks by spreading such risks across multiple counterparties and monitoring the risk profiles of these counterparties.
accounts receivable accounts receivable are unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from clients located around the globe.
factset performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients and does not require collateral from its clients. the company maintains reserves for potential write-offs and these losses have historically been within expectations. no single client represented 10% or more of factset's total revenues in any fiscal year presented. at august 31, 2017, the company's largest individual client accounted for 2% of total subscriptions and annual subscriptions from the ten largest clients did not surpass 15% of total subscriptions, consistent with august 31, 2016. at august 31, 2017
and 2016, the receivable reserve was $2.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively.
derivative instruments as a result of the use of derivative instruments, the company is exposed to counterparty credit risk. factset has incorporated counterparty risk into the fair value of its derivative assets and its own credit risk into the value of the company's derivative liabilities. factset calculates credit risk from observable data related to cds as quoted by publicly available information. counterparty risk is represented by cds spreads related to the senior secured debt of the respective bank with whom factset has executed these derivative transactions. because cds spread information is not available for factset, the company's credit risk is determined based on using a simple average of cds spreads for peer companies as determined by factset. to mitigate counterparty credit risk, factset enters into contracts with large financial institutions and regularly review credit exposure balances as well as the creditworthiness of the counterparties.
data content providers certain datasets that factset relies on have a limited number of suppliers, although the company makes every effort to assure that, where reasonable, alternative sources are available. however, factset is not dependent on any one third party data supplier in order to meet the needs of its clients. factset combines the data from these commercial databases into its own dedicated single online service, which the client accesses to perform their analysis. no single vendor or data supplier represented more than 10% of factset's total data expenses in any fiscal year presented.

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of the company's management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the company has evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as of the end of the annual period covered by this report. based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the company's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, (the "exchange act") are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
changes in internal control over financial reporting there have been no changes in the company's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the exchange act) during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the company's internal control over financial reporting.
in fiscal 2017, we acquired bi-sam technologies ("bisam"), factset digital solutions and vermilion holdings limited
("vermilion"). refer to note 8, business combinations, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the acquisitions. we are currently in the process of integrating the internal controls and procedures of vermilion and bisam into our internal controls over financial reporting. as provided under the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission, we will include the internal controls and procedures of vermilion and bisam in our annual assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for our 2018 fiscal year.
management assessed the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of august 31,
2017, except for the internal controls of bisam, factset digital solutions and vermilion which, in aggregate, constituted 4.8% of net assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets) and 4.5% of revenues as included in factset's consolidated financial statements for the year ended august 31, 2017. in making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission
(coso) in internal control-integrated framework. based on this assessment and those criteria, management believes that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of august 31, 2017.

●   foreign currency

●   off-balance sheet arrangements

●   share repurchase program

●   contractual obligations

●   dividends

●   significant accounting policies

●   critical accounting estimates

●   new accounting pronouncements

●   market trends

●   forward-looking factors

the md&a should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, of this annual report on form 10-k.
executive overview factset research systems inc. (the "company" or "factset") provides integrated financial information and analytical applications to the global investment community. we deliver insight and information to financial investment professionals through our analytics, service, content, and technology. by integrating comprehensive datasets and analytics across asset classes with client data, we support the workflow of both buy-side and sell-side clients. these professionals include portfolio managers, wealth managers, research and performance analysts, risk managers, research professionals, investment bankers and fixed income professionals. from streaming real-time data to historical information, including quotes, estimates, news and commentary, factset offers unique and third-party content through desktop, wireless, and off-platform solutions. our wide application suite offers tools and resources including company and industry analyses, full screening tools, portfolio analysis, risk profiles, alpha-testing, portfolio optimization and research management solutions. our revenues are derived from subscriptions to products and services such as workstations, analytics, enterprise data and content, research management and trade execution. investment management (buy-side) clients account for 84.1% of our annual subscription value and the remainder is derived from investment banking firms (sell-side) that perform mergers and acquisitions ("m&a") advisory work, capital markets services and equity research.
2017 year in review fiscal 2017 results continued our positive topline growth. organic revenue was up 6.9% while annual subscription value ("asv") increased 5.7% organically. this fiscal year marked our 39th year of operation, our 37th consecutive year of revenue growth and our 21st consecutive year of adjusted earnings growth as a public company. we have dedicated ourselves to helping our clients navigate an uncertain environment. as of august 31, 2017, asv totaled $1.32 billion, an increase of $166.8 million over the prior year. in addition, clients and users reached new highs of 4,744 and 88,846, respectively, in fiscal 2017. we returned $341.9 million to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.
22
in fiscal 2017, we continued to diversity our suite of products through strategic acquisitions and product investments, including vermilion holdings limited ("vermilion") in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, along with both bi-sam technologies ("bisam") and interactive data managed solutions, renamed factset digital solutions, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. these acquisitions increased factset's footprint in europe, added to the company's robust product offerings, and provided end-to-end solutions to clients.
as a testament to our broadening suite of premium products and the strength of our business and service model factset was awarded "best market data provider" and "best data analytics provider" by inside market data in fiscal 2017. we were also named the "best performance measurement system provider" by waters technology and other recognition included "best research and analytics tool" award for our wealth management tools at the annual systems in the city awards. portware also earned "best buy-side ems" for the fourth time and vermilion was recognized as "best client reporting solution" by ftf news technology innovation and "best client reporting solution" by wealthbriefing european awards.
client service / consultants a client-centric approach has always been a key foundation of our success at factset. we support our powerful information and analytical applications with a team of financial data and modeling experts. client satisfaction is a key metric by which we measure the success of our service. according to our fiscal 2017 global client satisfaction survey, 95% of respondents were satisfied or very satisfied with factset's support, consistent with the prior year. the depth of our knowledge, the data behind the models and the complex mathematics behind the answers each create an opportunity for us to forge close working relationships with our user community.
our industry-leading customer care is largely due to the talent of our employee population. as of august 31, 2017, employee headcount was 9,074, up 8.3% from a year ago. excluding workforces acquired in fiscal 2017, headcount increased 2.4% from a year ago. the increases were primarily in client-focused positions focused on client loyalty as evidenced by an annual client retention rate of greater than 95% of asv as of august 31, 2017. our consulting teams have been trained to listen to our clients' needs and transfer this knowledge directly to the product development teams, helping us transform suggestions into new or enhanced product offerings.
educating our clients is also an important component of our service. not only do we teach our users the nuances of our software and content offerings, but factset personnel are often thought-leaders in a particular area of financial modeling in our rapidly evolving industry. as a result, clients look to factset as a trusted partner to stay on the cutting edge of financial modeling and analysis. during fiscal 2017, over 2,500 clients attended live or online factset training sessions, with over 54,000 elearning courses taken.
in may 2017, john w. wiseman was named the company's new executive vice president, global head of sales and client solutions. in this role, mr. wiseman reports directly to factset's chief executive officer, phil snow, and is responsible for all global sales and client service activities for the company.
in order to optimize costs, we have invested in expanding our footprint and talent pool in india and the philippines, where we now have a combined workforce of over 5,000 people. of our total employees, 2,493 were located in the u.s., 1,322 in europe and 5,259 in asia pacific. approximately 70% of the company's employees were involved in company operations including content collection and software and systems engineering, 27% had a client focused role conducting sales and consulting services and the remaining 3% provided administrative support.

diluted eps                                                                $6.51                       $8.19         (20.5          )
free cash flow(1)                                                         $283.7                      $283.4           0.1          %
asv                                                                     $1,316.6                    $1,149.9          14.5   % (2)(3)

(1)   we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, which includes the cash cost for taxes and changes in working capital, less capital expenditures. the presentation of free cash flow is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap. we use free cash flow, a non-gaap measure, both in presenting our results to stockholders and the investment community, and in our internal evaluation and management of the business. management believes that this financial measure and the information we provide are useful to investors because they permit investors to view our performance using the same metric that we use to gauge progress in achieving our goals. free cash flow is also an indication of cash flow that may be available to fund further investments in future growth initiatives.

(2)   asv grew 5.7% organically year over year. organic asv excludes asv from acquisitions and dispositions completed within the last 12 months and the effects of foreign currency.

(3)   in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, factset changed its asv definition to exclude professional services as these fees are not subscription based.

(4)   in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, factset changed its client count definition to capture clients with asv greater than $10,000 versus the previous metric of clients with asv greater than $24,000. the prior year client count was restated to reflect this change for comparison purposes.

(5)   in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, factset changed its user count definition to account for users from workstations previously not captured due to certain product bundling and also users of the streetaccount web product. the prior year user count was restated to reflect this change for comparison purposes.

annual subscription value growth annual subscription value at any given point in time represents the forward-looking revenues for the next twelve months from all subscription services currently being supplied to clients. with proper notice to us, our clients are able to add to, delete portions of, or terminate service at any time, subject to certain contractual limitations. organic asv excludes asv from acquisitions and dispositions completed within the past 12 months and the effects of foreign currency. asv totaled $1.32 billion at august 31, 2017, up 5.7% organically over the prior year. the increase in asv was driven by growth across the majority of our key workflows including analytics, investment banking, and content and technology solutions ("cts"). additionally, we have leveraged relationships with existing clients to increase year over year sales through cross-selling and upselling of our diversified product suite.
buy-side clients accounted for 84.1% of asv while the remainder derived from sell-side firms that perform mergers and acquisitions advisory work, capital markets services and equity research. the buy-side asv experienced a growth rate of 5.9% compared to prior year, down 440 basis points from fiscal 2016. the sell-side asv had a 4.6% growth rate, down 310 basis points from the prior year.
asv from our u.s. operations was $825.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, up 4.9% organically from a year ago. international asv totaled $491.5 million, up 7.7% organically from a year ago. asv from our international operations represented 37.3% of our company-wide total, its highest level in factset history. our european organic asv achieved a growth rate of 6.1% over the last 12 months while asia pacific organic asv grew by 12.8%. this substantial shift in asv to international operations was due primarily to our recent acquisitions, which have significant sales and operations in europe.
client and user additions in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, factset changed its client count definition to capture clients with asv greater than $10,000 versus the previous metric of clients with asv greater than $24,000. the prior year client count was restated to reflect this change for comparison purposes. our total client count was 4,744 as of august 31, 2017 representing an increase of 539 net new clients or an equivalent 12.8% increase over fiscal 2016, as a result of cross-selling within factset's diverse product suite. we continue to focus on expanding our current client base as it is essential to our long-term growth strategy and encourages incremental sales growth of workstations, applications and content at our existing clients.
24
in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, factset changed its user count definition to account for users from workstations previously not captured due to certain product bundling and also users of the streetaccount web product. the prior year user count was restated to reflect this change for comparison purposes. using the new definition, as of august 31, 2017, there were 88,846 professionals using factset, an increase of 4,910 users or an equivalent 5.8% increase compared to fiscal 2016.
annual client retention as of august 31, 2017, was greater than 95% asv and 91% when expressed as a percentage of clients, down slightly from 92% in the prior year. our retention success, demonstrating that a majority of our clients maintain their subscriptions to factset year over year, highlights the strength of our business model. august 31, 2017, our largest individual client accounted for 2% of total subscriptions, and annual subscriptions from our ten largest clients did not surpass 15% of total client subscriptions, consistent with august 31, 2016.
returning value to stockholders we repurchased 1.6 million shares for $252.8 million during fiscal 2017 under the our existing share repurchase program. on march 27, 2017, the board of directors of factset approved a $300.0 million expansion of to the existing share repurchase program. including this expansion, $244.1 million is available for future share repurchases as of august 31, 2017.
on may 5, 2017, our board of directors approved a 12.0% increase in the regular quarterly dividend, beginning with the dividend payment on june 2017, with an increase to $0.56 per share, or $2.24 per share per annum. over the last 12 months, we have returned a total of $341.9 million to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, funded by cash generated from operations.
on july 1, 2016, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement ("asr agreement") to repurchase $120.0 million of our common stock. we received 595,607 shares of common stock on july 5, 2016, which was approximately 80% of the total number of shares of common stock expected to be repurchased under the asr agreement. the final settlement of the asr agreement occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with factset receiving an additional 102,916 shares of our common stock.
capital expenditures capital expenditures were $36.9 million during fiscal 2017, down from $47.7 million a year ago. approximately $21.4 million, or 58%, of our capital expenditures was primarily for purchases of more servers for our existing data centers, additional laptop computers and peripherals for new employees, upgrades to existing computer systems and improvements to our telecommunication equipment. the remainder of our capital expenditures was primarily for the build out of office space including $4.4 million at our chicago location, $4.4 million at our new york locations and $2.7 million at our india locations.

the fiscal 2016 provision for income taxes was $122.2 million, up 31.8% compared to fiscal 2015. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the company recognized tax expense of $30.8 million related to the gain on sale of our market metrics business. excluding tax expense from the gain, the provision for income taxes was $91.4 million in fiscal 2016, a decrease of 1.4% from fiscal 2015, primarily due to income tax benefits from the permanent reenactment of the u.s. federal r&d tax credit in december 2015, finalizing prior year tax returns and other discrete items. overall, we recognized income tax benefits of $10.5 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $6.5 million in the same period in fiscal 2015. offsetting the tax benefits and excluding the gain on sale was an increase in taxable income of $14.8 million.
net income and diluted earnings per share fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
net income decreased 23.8% to $258.3 million and diluted earnings per share decreased 20.5% to $6.51 during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. a large component of the decrease in net income and diluted earnings per share year over year related to the after-tax gain of $81.7 million from the sale of the market metrics business in fiscal 2016. this gain increased diluted earnings per share by $2.01. excluding the prior year after-tax gain on sale, net income increased 0.4% year over year, while diluted eps increased by 5.3%. during fiscal 2017, net income and earnings per share increased due to revenue growth of 8.3% year over year, couple with a reduction to the income tax provision of 29.6% primarily related to the gain from the sale of our market metrics business along with an organizational realignment. additionally, during fiscal 2017, foreign currency movements increased operating income by $7.1 million compared to a benefit of $11.6 million in the same period of fiscal 2016. these increases were partially offset by incremental employee compensation expense due to the hiring of 699 net new employees (including 498 employees from acquisitions completed in the last 12 months), an increase in professional fees, occupancy costs, computer related expenses, amortization of intangibles and acquisition-related costs. the increase in diluted earnings per share was also driven by a decrease in diluted shares outstanding as a result of continued share repurchases in fiscal 2017.
30
fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
net income increased 40.6% to $338.8 million and diluted earnings per share increased 43.4% to $8.19 during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. a large component of the increase in net income and diluted earnings per share during fiscal 2016 was an after-tax gain of $81.7 million related to the sale of the market metrics business. the gain increased diluted earnings per share by $2.01. excluding the after-tax gain on sale, net income increased 6.7% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, while diluted eps was $6.18. the increase year over year was primarily due to organic asv growth of 8.8% and tax benefits of $10.5 million related to the permanent reenactment of the u.s. federal r&d tax credit and finalizing the fiscal 2015 tax returns and other discrete items. these increases were partially offset by incremental employee compensation expense due to the hiring of 1,015 net new employees (including 166 employees from acquisitions completed in fiscal 2016). additionally, portware's operations reduced our operating margin by 120 basis points in fiscal 2016. in fiscal 2016 we also incurred non-recurring charges of approximately $3.3 million, after-tax, related primarily to legal matters. during fiscal 2016, foreign currency movements increased operating income by $11.6 million compared to a benefit of $11.2 million in the same period of fiscal 2015.

fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
cash and cash equivalents aggregated to $194.7 million, or 13.8% of our total assets at august 31, 2017, compared with $228.4 million, or 22.4% of our total assets at august 31, 2016. our cash and cash equivalents decreased $33.7 million during fiscal 2017 due primarily to $303.1 million in cash paid for acquisitions (net of cash acquired), $252.8 million in share repurchases under the existing share repurchase program, dividend payments of $80.9 million, capital expenditures of $36.9 million and $7.4 million from the purchase of investments (net of proceeds). these cash outflows were partially offset by cash provided by operations of $320.5 million, $275.0 million in net proceeds from long-term debt, $50.0 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, $10.3 million in tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements and $1.3 million from the effects of foreign currency fluctuation.
free cash flow for fiscal 2017 was $283.7 million compared to $283.4 million in the prior year comparable period. free cash flow generated during fiscal 2017 was attributable to $258.3 million of net income adjusted for $78.3 million of non-cash items partially offset by $36.9 million in capital expenditures and $16.0 million of negative working capital changes. free cash flow increased slightly from the comparable year ago period, due primarily to a reduction in capital expenditures partially offset by a decrease in net cash provided by operating activities. the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was the result of higher client receivables and the timing of taxes payments. our day's sales outstanding ("dso") was 41 days as of august 31, 2017, representing an increase from 31 days at august 31, 2016. the increase in dso was primarily related to our recent acquisitions as we work to align their collection policies with those of factset.
net cash used in investing activities was $347.3 million in fiscal 2017, representing a $188.9 million increase from fiscal 2016 due primarily to an increase in the cash used in acquisitions and the purchases of investments (net of proceeds), partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures. additionally, in fiscal 2016 we recognized proceeds from the sale of our market metrics business of $153.1 million. acquisitions during fiscal 2017, largely related to bisam and vermilion, resulted in a cash outflow of $303.1 million compared to a net cash outflow of $262.9 million for the portware acquisition during fiscal 2016. purchase of investments (net of proceeds) results in an increased cash outflow of $6.5 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. the decrease in capital expenditures of $10.9 million was due fiscal 2016 including the fit-out of new space in new york, chicago and at our corporate headquarters in norwalk. fiscal 2017 capital expenditures related primarily to computer equipment for our u.s. locations and additional expenses at our chicago, new york, and india locations.
31
during fiscal 2017, net cash used in financing activities was $8.2 million compared to $91.0 million in fiscal 2016. this decrease was due primarily to factset entering into an asr agreement to repurchase $120.0 million of our common stock in july 2016. we received 595,607 shares of common stock on july 5, 2016, which was approximately 80% of the total number of shares of common stock expected to be repurchased under the asr agreement. the final settlement of the asr agreement occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with us receiving an additional 102,916 shares of our common stock. excluding cash used in the asr agreement, cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2016 was $29.0 million, resulting in a fluctuation of $37.2 million in the current year. this fluctuation was due to an increase in cash used to repurchase common stock under our existing share repurchase program of $24.2 million, an increase in payments of regular quarterly dividends of $6.7 million, lower proceeds from employee stock plans of $6.8 million and lower tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements of $7.9 million. cash used in share repurchases increased year over year as we repurchased 1.6 million shares for $252.8 million under the existing share repurchase program compared to 1.5 million shares for $232.3 million in fiscal 2016. dividend payments increased as our board of directors approved a 12.0% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.56 per share, or $2.24 per share per annum, beginning with the dividend payment in june 2017. the year over year fluctuation was also due to additional borrowings under our 2017 credit agreement (defined in capital needs) of $575.0 million, used to fund our acquisition of bisam on march 17, 2017 and retire our existing debt of $365.0 million. in fiscal 2016 we borrowed $265.0 million under our previous credit agreement to fund our acquisition of portware on october 16, 2015. refer to the capital resources section of the md&a for a discussion of our long-term debt borrowings.
we expect that for at least the next 12 months, our operating expenses will continue to constitute a significant use of our cash. as of august 31, 2017, our total cash and cash equivalents worldwide was $194.7 million, with $575.0 million in outstanding borrowings. approximately $17.8 million of our total available cash and cash equivalents is held in bank accounts located within the u.s., $141.2 million in europe (predominantly within the uk, france, and germany) and the remaining $35.7 million is held in the asia pacific region. as of august 31, 2017, we believe our liquidity (including cash on hand, cash from operating activities and other cash flows that we expect to generate) within each geographic segment will be sufficient to meet our short-term and long-term operating requirements, as they occur, including working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend payments, stock repurchases, growth objectives and other financing activities. in addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
cash and cash equivalents aggregated to $228.4 million, or 22.4% of our total assets at august 31, 2016, compared with $158.9 million, or 21.6% of our total assets at august 31, 2015. our cash and cash equivalents increased $69.5 million during fiscal 2016 due to cash provided by operations of $331.1 million, $153.1 million in proceeds from the sale of our market metrics business, $56.9 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, $265.0 million in proceeds from long-term debt and $18.2 million in tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements. these cash inflows were partially offset by $262.9 million in cash paid to acquire portware, $356.8 million in share repurchases, dividend payments of $74.2 million, capital expenditures of $47.7 million and purchases of investments, net of proceeds, of $0.9 million.
free cash flow for fiscal 2016 was $283.4 million. free cash flow generated during fiscal 2016 was attributable to $338.8 million of net income, including an after-tax gain on sale of $81.7 million, $50.6 million of positive working capital changes and $58.3 million in non-cash expenses less $47.7 million in capital expenditures. free cash flow generated in fiscal 2016 was up $2.6 million from the comparable year ago period due to higher levels of net income and the timing of payables and accrued compensation, offset by incremental capital expenditures.
net cash used in investing activities was $158.4 million in fiscal 2016, representing a $93.5 million increase from fiscal 2015. this increase was primarily due to our acquisition of portware in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 which resulted in a net cash outflow of $262.9 million compared to a net cash outflow of $34.8 million for acquisitions occurring in fiscal 2015. additionally, cash used in investing activities increased year over year due to an increase in capital expenditures, primarily due to the fit-out of new space in new york, chicago and the expansion of our corporate headquarters in norwalk. these cash outflows were partially offset by net proceeds of $153.1 million from the sale of our market metrics business and an increase in proceeds from the sales of investments (net of purchases) of $3.5 million year over year.
during fiscal 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $91.0 million compared to $187.3 million in fiscal 2015. the year over year decrease in cash used was primarily due to proceeds from long-term debt of $265.0 million, offset by an increase in cash used in share repurchases of $100.6 million, lower proceeds and tax benefits from stock options exercised of $25.4 million, and an increase in payments of regular quarterly dividends of $7.7 million. the proceeds from long-term debt related to additional borrowings under our previous credit agreement used to fund our acquisition of portware on october 16, 2015. cash used in share repurchases increased year over year as we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $232.3 million under the existing share repurchase program and 0.6 million shares for $120.0 million related to the asr agreement entered into in july 2016. we repurchased 1.7 million shares for $252.8 million in fiscal 2015 under the existing share repurchase program. dividend payments increased as our board of directors approved a 13.6% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share, or $2.00 per share per annum, beginning with the dividend payment in june 2016.
32
capital resources capital expenditures capital expenditures were $36.9 million during fiscal 2017, down from $47.7 million a year ago. approximately $21.4 million, or 58%, of our capital expenditures was primarily for purchases of more servers for our existing data centers, additional laptop computers and peripherals for new employees, upgrades to existing computer systems and improvements to our telecommunication equipment. the remainder of our capital expenditures was primarily for the build out of office space including $4.4 million at our chicago location, $4.4 million at our new york locations and $2.7 million at our india locations.
capital expenditures were $47.7 million during fiscal 2016, up from $25.7 million in fiscal 2015. approximately $27.7 million, or 58%, of our capital expenditures related to the build out of office space including $15.1 million at our new york location, $3.9 million at our chicago location and $1.4 million at our corporate headquarters in norwalk. the remainder of our capital expenditures was primarily for purchases of more servers for our existing data centers, additional laptop computers and peripherals for new employees, upgrades to existing computer systems and improvements to our telecommunication equipment.
capital needs long-term debt on march 17, 2017, the company entered into a credit agreement (the "2017 credit agreement") between factset, as the borrower, and pnc bank, national association ("pnc"), as the administrative agent and lender. the 2017 credit agreement provides for a $575.0 million revolving credit facility (the "2017 revolving credit facility"). we may request borrowings under the 2017 revolving credit facility until its maturity date of march 17, 2020. the 2017 credit agreement also allows factset, subject to certain requirements, to arrange for additional borrowings with pnc for an aggregate amount of up to $225.0 million, provided that any such request for additional borrowings must be in a minimum amount of $25.0 million. at our option, a borrowing may be in the form of a base rate loan or a libor rate loan. borrowings under the loan bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to the daily libor rate plus 1.00%. interest on the loan outstanding is payable quarterly in arrears and on the maturity date. there are no prepayment penalties if we elect to prepay the outstanding loan amounts prior to the scheduled maturity date. the principal balance is payable in full on the maturity date.
in conjunction with factset's entrance into the 2017 credit agreement, the company borrowed $575.0 million in the form of a libor rate loan under the 2017 revolving credit facility and retired the outstanding debt under its previous credit agreement between factset, as the borrower, and bank of america, n.a., as the lender. the total principal amount of the debt outstanding at the time of retirement was $365.0 million and there were no prepayment penalties. proceeds from the 2017 revolving credit facility were also used to fund factset's acquisition of bisam.
all outstanding loan amounts are reported as long-term debt within the consolidated balance sheet at august 31, 2017. during fiscal 2017 and 2016, we paid approximately $8.4 million and $3.1 million, respectively, in interest on our outstanding loan amounts. the principal balance is payable in full on the maturity date.
as of august 31, 2017, no commitment fee was owed by factset since it borrowed the full amount under the 2017 credit agreement. in fiscal 2017, factset incurred approximately $0.4 million in legal costs to draft and review the 2017 credit agreement. these costs were capitalized as loan origination fees and are amortized into interest expense over the term of the loan using the effective interest method.
the 2017 credit agreement contained covenants restricting certain factset activities, which are usual and customary for this type of loan. in addition, the 2017 credit agreement required that factset maintain a consolidated leverage ratio, as measured by total funded debt/ebitda below a specified level as of the end of each fiscal quarter. the company was in compliance with all of the covenants of the 2017 credit agreement as of august 31, 2017.
as of august 31, 2017, the fair value of our long-term debt was $575.0 million, which we believe approximates carrying amount as the terms and interest rates approximate market rates given its floating interest rate basis.
letters of credit from time to time, we are required to obtain letters of credit in the ordinary course of business. approximately $1.9 million of standby letters of credit have been issued in connection with various current leased office spaces as of august 31, 2017. these standby letters of credit contain covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain minimum levels of consolidated net worth and certain leverage and fixed charge ratios. as of august 31, 2017 and 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the standby letters of credit.

foreign currency foreign currency exposure certain wholly owned subsidiaries within the european and asia pacific segments operate under a functional currency different from the u.s. dollar. the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into u.s. dollars using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses. translation gains and losses that arise from translating assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders' equity.
as of august 31, 2017, our non-u.s. dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized are estimated to be approximately $90 million while our non-u.s. dollar denominated expenses are approximately $300 million, which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of approximately $210 million per year. our foreign currency exchange exposure is related to our operating expense base in countries outside the u.s., where 73% of our employees were located as of august 31, 2017. during fiscal 2017, foreign currency movements decreased operating income by $7.1 million, compared to $11.6 million a year ago.
foreign currency hedges as of august 31, 2017, factset maintained foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 75% of its indian rupee exposure through the third quarter of fiscal 2019. the gross notional value of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase indian rupees with u.s. dollars was rs. 3.8 billion.
there were no other outstanding foreign currency forward contracts as of august 31, 2017. a loss on derivatives of $2.9 million was recorded into operating income during fiscal 2017, compared to a loss of $0.5 million in fiscal 2016.
off-balance sheet arrangements at august 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no off-balance sheet financing or other arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships (such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities) established for purposes of facilitating off-balance sheet financing or other debt arrangements or for other contractually limited purposes.
share repurchase program in fiscal 2017, we repurchased 1.6 million shares for $252.8 million compared to 1.5 million shares for $232.3 million in fiscal 2016 under the our existing share repurchase program. over the last 12 months, we have returned $341.9 million to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, funded by cash generated from operations. on march 27, 2017, the board of directors of factset approved a $300.0 million expansion of to the existing share repurchase program. including this expansion, $244.1 million is available for future share repurchases as of august 31, 2017.
on july 1, 2016, we entered into an asr agreement to repurchase $120.0 million of our common stock. we received 595,607 shares of common stock on july 5, 2016, which was approximately 80% of the total number of shares of common stock expected to be repurchased under the asr agreement. the final settlement of the asr agreement occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with us receiving an additional 102,916 shares of our common stock.
contractual obligations fluctuations in our operating results, the degree of success of our accounts receivable collection efforts, the timing of tax and other payments as well as necessary capital expenditures to support growth of our operations will impact our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. the effect of our contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be considered in conjunction with the factors mentioned here.

(1)   operating lease amounts include future minimum lease payments under all our non-cancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year. for more information on our operating leases, see note 19, commitments and contingencies, in the notes to the company's consolidated financial statements included in item 8.

(2)   purchase commitments represent payments due in future periods in respect of obligations to our various data vendors as well as commitments to purchase goods and services such as telecommunication and computer maintenance services.

(3)   represents the amount due under the company's 2017 credit agreement.

(4)   non-current income taxes payable of $11.5 million and non-current deferred tax liabilities of $24.9 million have been excluded in the table above due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future payments.

purchase orders do not necessarily reflect a binding commitment but are merely indicative of authorizations and intention to conclude purchases in the future. for the purpose of this tabular disclosure, purchase obligations for goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. it is expected that all the contractual obligations noted in the table will be funded from existing cash and cash flows from operations. expected timing pertaining to the contractual obligations included in the table above has been estimated based on information currently available. the amounts paid and the timing of those payments may differ based on when the goods and services provided by our vendors to whom we are contractually obligated are actually received as well as due to changes to agreed-upon amounts for any of our obligations.
at august 31, 2017, we leased approximately 1,143,000 square feet of office space, which we believe is adequate for our current needs and that additional space is available for lease to meet any future needs. including new lease agreements executed during fiscal 2017, our worldwide-leased office space increased by approximately 71,000 square feet, or 7%, from august 31, 2016. this increase was primarily due to leases related to acquisitions completed in fiscal 2017 as well as expanded office space in india, offset by the consolidation of certain other office spaces.
as disclosed earlier in the capital resources section of this md&a, factset entered into the 2017 credit agreement on march 17, 2017 and borrowed $575.0 million. in conjunction with the 2017 credit agreement, factset retired its outstanding loan amount of $365.0 million under the previous credit agreement.
with the exception of the new leases entered into in the ordinary course of business and the 2017 credit agreement, there were no other significant changes to our contractual obligations during fiscal 2017.
dividends on may 5, 2017, our board of directors approved a 12.0% increase in the regular quarterly dividend beginning with the dividend payment on june 2017 which was $0.56 per share, or $2.24 per share per annum. with our dividends and our share repurchases, in the aggregate, we have returned $341.9 million to shareholders over the past 12 months. future cash dividends will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors we considered relevant and is subject to final determination by our board of directors.

all of the above cash dividends were paid from existing cash resources. future cash dividends will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors we considered relevant and is subject to final determination by our board of directors.
significant accounting policies we describe our significant accounting policies in note 3, summary of significant accounting policies, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 below.
critical accounting estimates we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. in addition, there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements.
business combinations we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. all of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies and contingent consideration are recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date. the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. our estimates are based on historical experience, information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and when appropriate, includes assistance from independent third party appraisal firms. our significant assumptions and estimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. in addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates.
performance-based equity awards we have an employee stock-based compensation plan, which allows for the issuance of performance-based equity awards to employees. accounting guidance requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all performance-based equity awards made to employees based on the estimated fair values of the awards that are expected to vest. at the end of each reporting period, management must make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving our performance targets because the number of stock options that vest will be predicated on us achieving these levels. however, there is no current guarantee that such options will vest in whole or in part.
february 2015 performance-based option grant review in connection with the acquisition of code red, we granted 137,522 performance-based stock options during the second quarter of fiscal 2015. of the total amount granted, 68,761 performance-based options were eligible to vest if certain code red asv and operating margin targets were achieved over a two-year measurement period ending february 28, 2017. at the conclusion of the measurement period, 70% of the options were deemed eligible to vest, with the remaining options being forfeited. the option holders must remain employed by factset through february 28, 2019 in order for the options to vest. as of august 31, 2017, total unamortized stock-based compensation of $0.8 million will be recognized as expense over the remaining vesting period of 1.4 years.

the remaining 68,761 options granted in february 2015 are eligible to cliff vest based on a four-year measurement period ending february 28, 2019. as of august 31, 2017, total unamortized stock-based compensation of $0.4 million will be recognized as expense over the remaining vesting period of 1.4 years. a change, up or down, in the actual financial performance levels achieved by code red in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense:

* amounts represent the cumulative catch-up adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of august 31, 2017.
october 2015 and august 2016 performance-based option grant review in connection with the acquisition of portware during the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we granted 530,418 performance-based stock options. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we modified the vesting of these grants to allow 70% of the options to become eligible to vest, with the remaining options being forfeited. in conjunction with this modification, we recognized a cumulative catch-up adjustment of $1.8 million. the remaining options will vest 40% on the second anniversary date of the grant and 20% on each subsequent anniversary date provided the option holders remain employed by factset. as of august 31, 2017, total unamortized stock-based compensation of $2.9 million will be recognized as expense over the remaining vesting period of 3.1 years.
we granted 20,911 additional performance-based stock options to portware employees in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 with similar performance conditions. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, factset modified the vesting of these grants to allow 70% of the options to become eligible to vest, with the remaining options being forfeited. in conjunction with this modification, factset recognized a cumulative catch-up adjustment of $0.1 million. the remaining options will vest 40% on the second anniversary date of the grant and 20% on each subsequent anniversary date provided the option holders remain employed by factset. as of august 31, 2017, total unamortized stock-based compensation of $0.4 million will be recognized as expense over the remaining vesting period of 3.9 years.
january 2017 performance-based option grant review in connection with the acquisition of vermilion, factset granted 61,744 performance-based stock options in january 2017. these performance-based options will vest 40% on the second anniversary date of the grant and 20% on each subsequent anniversary date if certain vermilion revenue and operating income targets are achieved by november 30, 2018. the option holders must also remain employed by factset for the options to be eligible to vest. as of august 31, 2017, factset does not believe these growth targets are probable of being achieved, and as such, no stock-based compensation expense is expected to be recognized in connection with these performance-based options. a change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by vermilion in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense:
vesting percentage (in thousands)          cumulative          remaining expense catch-up adjustment*      to be recognized

june 2017 performance-based option grant review in connection with the acquisition of bisam, factset granted 206,417 performance-based stock options in june 2017. these performance-based options will vest 40% on the second anniversary date of the grant and 20% on each subsequent anniversary date if certain bisam revenue and operating income targets are achieved by march 31, 2019. the option holders must also remain employed by factset for the options to be eligible to vest. as of august 31, 2017, factset does not believe these growth targets are probable of being achieved, and as such, no stock-based compensation expense is expected to be recognized in connection with these performance-based options. a change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by bisam in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense:

* amounts represent the cumulative catch-up adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of august 31, 2017.
accrued compensation we make significant estimates in determining our accrued compensation. approximately 15% of our total employee compensation is variable and discretionary. we conduct a final review of company and departmental individual performance each year end to determine the amount of discretionary employee compensation. we also review compensation throughout the year to determine how overall performance tracks against management's expectations. management takes these and other factors, including historical performance, into account in reviewing accrued compensation estimates on a quarterly basis and adjusts accrual rates as appropriate. as of august 31, 2017 and 2016 the amount of the variable employee compensation recorded within accrued compensation was $39.2 million and $38.2 million, respectively.
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is not amortized as it is estimated to have an indefinite life. at least annually, we are required to test goodwill at the reporting unit level for potential impairment, and, if impaired, write down to fair value based on the present value of discounted cash flows. our reporting units evaluated for potential impairment were the u.s., europe and asia pacific, which is aligned with how the chief operating decision making group ("codmg"), composed of the ceo and senior management, manages the business and the demographic markets in which factset serves. the three reporting units are consistent with the operating segments reported as there is no discrete financial information available for the subsidiaries within each operating segment. the impairment test requires management to make judgments in connection with these reporting units, including assigning assets, liabilities, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit.
our impairment analysis contains uncertainties as it requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate industry and economic factors including market conditions, legal and technological factors and the profitability of our business strategies. it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategies taking into consideration present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations. we have not made any material changes in our impairment analysis methodology during the past three fiscal years. while we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for goodwill impairment losses, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions. future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment do exist and that goodwill associated with our previous acquisitions is impaired, which could result in an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income and a write-down of the related asset.
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, consistent with previous years, it was determined that there was no impairment, with the fair value of each of the company's reporting units significantly exceeding carrying value. the carrying value of goodwill as of august 31, 2017 and 2016, was $707.6 million and $452.9 million, respectively.
our identifiable intangible assets consist of acquired content databases, client relationships, software technology, non-compete agreements and trade names resulting from acquisitions, which have been fully integrated into our operations. depending on the nature of the intangible asset, it is amortized on either a straight-line or an accelerated basis using estimated useful lives ranging from two to twenty years. these useful lives are evaluated quarterly to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. if the estimate of the remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. there were no adjustments to the useful lives of intangible assets subject to amortization during any of the periods presented. these intangible assets have no assigned residual values as of august 31, 2017 and 2016.
38
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. measurement of any impairment loss for intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. no indicators of impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented. our ongoing consideration of the recoverability could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our results of operations. the carrying value of intangible assets as of august 31, 2017 and 2016, was $173.5 million and $93.2 million, respectively.
long-lived assets long-lived assets, comprised of property, equipment and leasehold improvements are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that may cause an impairment review include significant changes in technology that make current computer-related assets that we use in our operations obsolete or less useful and significant changes in the way we use these assets in our operations. when evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment if impairment indicators are present, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value, which may be based on estimated future cash flows (discounted and with interest charges). we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset's carrying value exceeds the asset's estimated fair value. if we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset. using the impairment evaluation methodology described here, there have been no long-lived asset impairment charges for each of the last three years. the carrying value of long-lived assets as of august 31, 2017 and 2016, was $100.5 million and $84.6 million, respectively.
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.
estimated tax provision and tax contingencies we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our tax provision is an estimate based on our understanding of laws in federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions. these laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business including ours. the tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes. our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes, foreign operations, r&d and other tax credits, tax audit settlements, incentive-stock options and domestic production activities deductions. our annual effective tax rate was 25.0%, 26.5% and 27.8% in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
we recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position as of the reporting date. otherwise, no benefit can be recognized. the tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. we will classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that we anticipate payment of cash within one year. additionally, we accrue interest on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws. interest is classified as income tax expense in the financial statements.
39
as of august 31, 2017, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling $11.5 million, including $1.5 million of accrued interest, recorded as taxes payable (non-current) within the consolidated balance sheet. unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions taken on tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements. when applicable, we adjust the previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results when the position is effectively settled. if recognized, the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest would be recorded as a benefit to tax expense on the consolidated statements of income. audits by multiple tax authorities are currently ongoing. significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. for this reason, we regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest.
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by numerous factors such as changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations of them. significant judgment is required to determine recognition and measurement. further, as a result of certain ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. our failure to meet these commitments could adversely affect our provision for income taxes. in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.
new accounting pronouncements see note 3, summary of significant accounting policies, in the notes to the company's consolidated financial statements included in item 8 for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption, which we include here by reference.
market trends in the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to financial risks involving the volatility of equity markets as well as foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
approximately 84.1% of our asv is derived from our investment management clients. the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management. an equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but could cause a significant increase in redemption requests. moreover, extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation, resulting in lower demand for services from investment management clients. our investment banking clients that perform m&a advisory work, provide capital markets services and equity research, account for approximately 15.9% of our asv. a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by the largest banks. credit continues to impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations. clients could encounter similar problems. a lack of confidence in the global banking system could cause declines in m&a funded by debt. additional uncertainty, consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect our financial results and future growth. regardless, the size of banks in general is shrinking as they deleverage their balance sheets and adjust their expense bases to future revenue opportunities. our revenues may decline if banks, including those involved in recent merger activity, significantly reduce headcount in the areas of corporate m&a, capital markets and equity research to compensate for the issues created by other departments.
due to the global nature of our operations, we conduct business outside the u.s. in several currencies including the british pound sterling, euro, indian rupee, japanese yen and philippine peso. to the extent that our international activities increase in the future, our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase. to manage this exposure, we utilize derivative instruments (foreign currency forward contracts). by their nature, all derivative instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of market and credit risk. the market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposure to the counterparties associated with these instruments. our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings associated with changes in foreign currency.
on june 23, 2016, the united kingdom ("uk") held a referendum in which british citizens approved an exit from the european union ("eu"), commonly referred to as "brexit." as a result of the referendum, the global markets and currencies had been adversely impacted, including a sharp decline in the value of the british pound sterling as compared to the u.s. dollar at that time. volatility in exchange rates is expected to continue in the short term as the uk negotiates its exit from the eu. the uk inflation rate has also experienced significant price level increase compared to the past four years. as the negotiation process continues and the timeframe from the initial vote increases, the uk economic performance has been stronger than originally expected. increased european confidence and uk consumer spending has contributed to the recovery of the economic outlook. in the longer term, as negotiations continue, any impact from brexit on us will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations. although it is unknown what the result of those negotiations will be, it is possible that new terms may adversely affect our operations and financial results. while we evaluate our own risks and uncertainty related to brexit, we will continue to partner with our clients to help them navigate the fluctuating international markets. our products, including our datasets such as georev, allow our clients to understand geographic exposure and assess the risks of operating on a global scale so they may make informed business decisions.

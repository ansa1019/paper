item 1a.   risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks. these risks are not exclusive, and additional risks to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, the factors mentioned under "forward-looking statements" above and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. many of these risks are interrelated and could occur under similar business and economic conditions, and the occurrence of certain of them may in turn cause the emergence or exacerbate the effect of others. such a combination could materially increase the severity of the impact of these risks on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
overview on an annual basis, the company reviews its risk identification framework which documents the definition, potential manifestation, and management of its risks. these risk factors describe the company's material risks and their potential manifestation, as reflected in the risk identification framework. the company's risk management framework is described under "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-risk management."
the company has categorized its risks into tactical and strategic risks. tactical risks may cause damage to the company, and the company seeks to manage and mitigate them through models, metrics and the overall risk framework. the company's tactical risks include investment, insurance, market, liquidity, and operational risk. strategic risks can cause the company's fundamental business model to change, either through a shift in the businesses in which it is engaged or a change in execution. the company's strategic risks include regulatory, technological changes and other external factors. these risks, as well as the sub-risks that may impact the company, are discussed below.
investment risk our investment portfolios are subject to the risk of loss due to default or deterioration in credit quality or value.
30
we are exposed to investment risk through our investments, which primarily consist of public and private fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans, equity securities and alternative assets including private equity, hedge funds and real estate. for a discussion of our general account investments, see "management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition-general account investments." we are also exposed to investment risk through a potential counterparty default.
investment risk may result from (1) economic conditions, (2) adverse capital market conditions, including disruptions in individual market sectors or a lack of buyers in the marketplace, (3) volatility, (4) credit spread changes, (5) benchmark interest rate changes, (6) changes in foreign currency exchange rates and (7) declines in value of underlying collateral. these factors may impact the credit quality, liquidity and value of our investments and derivatives, potentially resulting in higher capital charges and unrealized or realized losses. also, certain investments we hold, regardless of market conditions, are relatively illiquid and our ability to promptly sell these assets for their full value may be limited. additionally, our valuation of investments may include methodologies, inputs and assumptions which are subject to change and different interpretation and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially impact our results of operations or financial condition. for information about the valuation of our investments, see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
our investment portfolio is subject to credit risk, which is the risk that an obligor (or guarantor) is unable or unwilling to meet its contractual payment obligations on its fixed maturity security, loan or other obligations. credit risk may manifest in an idiosyncratic manner (i.e., specific to an individual borrower or industry) or through market-wide credit cycles. financial deterioration of the obligor increases the risk of default and may increase the capital charges required under such regimes as the naic rbc, the fsa smr or other constructs to hold the investment and in turn, potentially limit our overall capital flexibility. credit defaults (as well as credit impairments, realized losses on credit-related sales, and increases in credit related reserves) may result in losses which adversely impact earnings, capital and our ability to appropriately match our liabilities and meet future obligations.
our company is subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction could default or deteriorate in creditworthiness before or at the final settlement of a transaction. in the normal course of business, we enter into financial contracts to manage risks (such as derivatives to manage market risk and reinsurance treaties to manage insurance risk), improve the return on investments (such as securities lending and repurchase transactions) and provide sources of liquidity or financing (such as credit agreements, securities lending agreements and repurchase agreements). these transactions expose the company to counterparty risk. counterparties include commercial banks, investment banks, broker-dealers and insurance and reinsurance companies. in the event of a counterparty deterioration or default, the magnitude of the losses will depend on then current market conditions and the length of time required to enter into a replacement transaction with a new counterparty. losses are likely to be higher under stressed conditions.
our investment portfolio is subject to equity risk, which is the risk of loss due to deterioration in market value of public equity or alternative assets. we include public equity and alternative assets (including private equity, hedge funds and real estate) in our portfolio constructions, as these asset classes can provide cash flows over longer periods of time, aligning with the emergence of cash flows of our liabilities. public equity and alternative assets have varying degrees of price transparency. equities traded on stock exchanges (public equities) have significant price transparency, as transactions are often required to be disclosed publicly. assets for which price transparency is more opaque include private equity (joint ventures/limited partnerships) and direct real estate. as these investments typically do not trade on public markets and indications of realizable market value may not be readily available, valuations can be infrequent and/or more volatile. a sustained decline in public equity and alternative markets may reduce the returns earned by our investment portfolio through lower than expected dividend income, property operating income, and capital gains, thereby adversely impacting earnings, capital, and product pricing assumptions. these assets may also produce volatility in earnings as a result of uneven distributions on the underlying investments.
insurance risk
31
we have significant liabilities for policyholders benefits which are subject to insurance risk. insurance risk is the risk that actual experience deviates adversely from our best estimate insurance assumptions, including mortality, morbidity, and policyholder behavior assumptions. we provide a variety of insurance products, on both an individual and group basis, that are designed to help customers protect against a variety of financial uncertainties. our insurance products protect customers against their potential risk of loss by transferring those risks to the company, where those risks can be managed more efficiently through pooling and diversification over a larger number of independent exposures. during this transfer process, we assume the risk that actual losses experienced in our insurance products deviates significantly from what we expect. more specifically, insurance risk is concerned with the deviations that impact our future liabilities. our profitability may decline if mortality experience, morbidity experience or policyholder behavior experience differ significantly from our expectations when we price our products. in addition, if we experience higher than expected claims our liquidity position may be adversely impacted, and we may incur losses on investments if we are required to sell assets in order to pay claims. if it is necessary to sell assets at a loss, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. for a discussion of the impact of changes in insurance assumptions on our financial condition, see "management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition-accounting policies and pronouncements-application of critical accounting estimates-policyholder liabilities."
certain of our insurance products are subject to mortality risk, which is the risk that actual deaths experienced deviate adversely from our expectations. mortality risk is a biometric risk that can manifest in the following ways:
â€¢   mortality calamity is the risk that mortality rates in a single year deviate adversely from what is expected as the result of pandemics, natural or man-made disasters, military actions or terrorism. a mortality calamity event will reduce our earnings and capital and we may be forced to liquidate assets before maturity in order to pay the excess claims. mortality calamity risk is more pronounced in respect of geographic areas (including major metropolitan centers, where we have concentrations of customers, including under group and individual life insurance), concentrations of employees or significant operations, and in respect of countries and regions in which we operate that are subject to a greater potential threat of military action or conflict. ultimate losses would depend on several factors, including the rates of mortality and morbidity among various segments of the insured population, the collectability of reinsurance, the possible macroeconomic effects on our investment portfolio, the effect on lapses and surrenders of existing policies, as well as sales of new policies and other variables.
â€¢   mortality trend is the risk that mortality improvements in the future deviate adversely from what is expected. mortality trend is a long-term risk in that can emerge gradually over time. longevity products, such as annuities and pension risk transfer, experience adverse impacts due to higher-than-expected mortality improvement. mortality products, such as life insurance, experience adverse impacts due to lower-than-expected improvement. if this risk were to emerge, the company would update assumptions used to calculate reserves for inforce business, which may result in additional assets needed to meet the higher expected annuity claims or earlier expected life claims. an increase in reserves due to revised assumptions has an immediate impact on our results of operations and financial condition; however, economically the impact is generally long term as the excess outflow is paid over time.
â€¢   mortality base is the risk that actual base mortality deviates adversely from what is expected in pricing and valuing our products. base mortality risk can arise from a lack of credible data on which to base the assumptions.
certain of our insurance products are subject to morbidity risk, which is the risk that either incidence or continuation experience deviates adversely from what is expected. morbidity risk is a biometric risk that can manifest in the following ways:
â€¢   morbidity incidence is the risk that the rate at which policyholders become unhealthy (and qualify for benefits under insurance policies) deviates adversely from what is expected. we are primarily exposed to morbidity incidence risk through short-term disability products, long-term disability products, long-term care products, and the accident and health products we sell in japan.
â€¢   morbidity continuation is the risk that the length of time for which policyholders remain unhealthy deviates adversely from what is expected. this risk is primarily in our disability and long-term care products.
in each case, an increase in claims, or an increase in reserves due to revised morbidity assumptions can have an immediate impact on our results of operations and financial condition; however, economically the impact of morbidity risk for products that pay out for ongoing illness or disability generally emerges over the longer term as the morbidity claims are paid.
certain of our insurance products are subject to policyholder behavior risk, which is the risk that actual policyholder behavior deviates adversely from what is expected. policyholder behavior risk includes the following components:
32
â€¢   lapse calamity is the risk that lapse rates over the short-term deviate adversely from what is expected. only certain products are exposed to this risk. products that offer a cash surrender value that resides in the general account, such as general account stable value products, could pose a potential short-term lapse calamity risk. surrender of these products can impact liquidity, and it may be necessary in certain market conditions to sell assets to meet surrender demands. lapse calamity can also impact our earnings through its impact on estimated future profits.
â€¢   policyholder behavior efficiency is the risk that the behavior of our customers or policyholders deviates adversely from what is expected. policyholder behavior efficiency risk arises through product features which provide some degree of choice or flexibility for the policyholder, which can impact the amount and/or timing of claims. such choices include lapse, partial withdrawal, policy loan, utilization, and premium payment rates for contracts with flexible premiums. while some behavior is driven by macro factors such as market movements, policyholder behavior at a fundamental level is driven primarily by policyholders' individual needs, which may differ significantly from product to product depending on many factors including the features offered, the approach taken to market each product, and competitor pricing. for example, persistency (the probability that a policy or contract will remain in force) within our annuities business may be significantly impacted by the value of guaranteed minimum benefits contained in many of our variable annuity products being higher than current account values in light of poor market performance as well as other factors. many of our products also provide our customers with wide flexibility with respect to the amount and timing of premium deposits and the amount and timing of withdrawals from the policy's value. results may vary based on differences between actual and expected premium deposits and withdrawals for these products, especially if these product features are relatively new to the marketplace. the pricing of certain of our variable annuity products that contain certain living benefit guarantees is also based on assumptions about utilization rates, or the percentage of contracts that will utilize the benefit during the contract duration, including the timing of the first lifetime income withdrawal. results may vary based on differences between actual and expected benefit utilization. finally, surrenders of certain insurance products may increase following a downgrade of our financial strength ratings or adverse publicity. policyholder behavior efficiency is generally a long-term risk that emerges over time. an increase in reserves due to revised assumptions has an immediate impact on our results of operations and financial condition; however, from an economic or cash flow perspective, the impact is generally long term as the excess outflow is paid over time.
our ability to reprice products is limited, and may not compensate for deviations from our expected insurance assumptions.
although some of our products permit us to increase premiums or adjust other charges and credits during the life of the policy or contract, the adjustments permitted under the terms of the policies or contracts may not be sufficient to maintain profitability or may cause the policies or contracts to lapse. for example, for our long-term care insurance products, our assumptions for reserves for future policy benefits have factored in an estimate of the timing and amount of anticipated and yet-to-be-filed premium increases which will require state approval. our actual experience obtaining pricing increases could be materially different than what we have assumed, resulting in further policy liability increases which could be material. many of our products do not permit us to increase premiums or adjust other charges and credits or limit those adjustments during the life of the policy or contract. even if permitted under the policy or contract, we may not be able or willing to raise premiums or adjust other charges sufficiently, or at all. accordingly, significant deviations in actual experience from our pricing assumptions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our products. finally, the development of a secondary market for life insurance, including life settlements or "viaticals" and investor owned life insurance, and third-party investor strategies in the annuities business, could adversely affect the profitability of existing business and our pricing assumptions for new business.
market risk the profitability of many of our insurance and annuity products, as well as the fees we earn in our investment management business, are subject to market risk. market risk is the risk of loss from changes in interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates.
the profitability of many of our insurance and annuity products depends in part on the value of the separate accounts supporting these products, which can fluctuate substantially depending on market conditions. market conditions resulting in reductions in the value of assets we manage has an adverse effect on the revenues and profitability of our investment management business, which depends on fees related primarily to the value of assets under management, and could decrease the value of our strategic investments.
33
derivative instruments we use to hedge and manage foreign exchange, interest rate and equity market risks associated with our products and businesses, and other risks might not perform as intended or expected, resulting in higher than expected realized losses and stresses on liquidity. market conditions can limit availability of hedging instruments, require us to post additional collateral, and further increase the cost of executing product related hedges and such costs may not be recovered in the pricing of the underlying products being hedged.
market risk may limit opportunities for investment of available funds at appropriate returns, including due to the current low interest rate environment, or other factors, with possible negative impacts on our overall results. limited opportunities for attractive investments may lead to holding cash for long periods of time and increased use of derivatives for duration management and other portfolio management purposes. the increased use of derivatives may increase the volatility of our u.s. gaap results and our statutory capital.
our investments, results of operations and financial condition may also be adversely affected by developments in the global economy, in the u.s. economy (including as a result of actions by the federal reserve with respect to monetary policy, and adverse political developments), and in the japanese economy (including due to the effects of inflation or deflation, interest rate volatility, changes in the japan sovereign credit rating, and material changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the u.s. dollar). global, u.s. or japanese economic activity and financial markets may in turn be negatively affected by adverse developments or conditions in specific geographical regions.
for a discussion of the impact of changes in market conditions on our financial condition see "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."
our insurance and annuity products and certain of our investment products, and our investment returns, are subject to interest rate risk, which is the risk of loss arising from asset/liability duration mismatches within our general account investments as well as invested assets of other entities and operations. the risk of mismatch in asset/liability duration is mainly driven by the specific dynamics of product liabilities. some product liabilities are expected to have only modest risk related to interest rates because cash flows can be matched by available assets in the investable space. the interest rate risk emerges primarily from their tail cash flows (30 years or more), which cannot be matched by assets for sale in the marketplace, exposing the company to future reinvestment risk. market-sensitive cash flows exist with other product liabilities including products whose cash flows can be linked to market performance through secondary guarantees, minimum crediting rates, and/or changes in insurance assumptions.
our exposure to interest rates can manifest itself over years as in the case of earnings compression or in the short term by creating volatility in both earnings and capital. for example, some of our products expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce the spread between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts and the rate of return we are able to earn on our general account investments supporting the contracts. when interest rates decline or remain low, as they have in recent years, we must invest in lower-yielding instruments, potentially reducing net investment income and constraining our ability to offer certain products. this risk is increased as more policyholders may retain their policies in a low rate environment. since many of our policies and contracts have guaranteed minimum crediting rates or limit the resetting of crediting rates, the spreads could decrease or go negative.
alternatively, when interest rates rise, we may not be able to replace the assets in our general account as quickly with the higher-yielding assets needed to fund the higher crediting rates necessary to keep these products and contracts competitive. it is possible that fewer policyholders may retain their policies and annuity contracts as they pursue higher crediting rates, which could expose the company to losses and liquidity stress. in addition, rising interest rates could cause a decline in the market value of fixed income assets the company manages which in turn could result in lower asset management fees earned.
our mitigation efforts with respect to interest rate risk are primarily focused on maintaining an investment portfolio with diversified maturities that has a key rate duration profile that is approximately equal to the key rate duration profile of our estimated liability cash flow profile; however, this estimate of the liability cash flow profile is complex and could turn out to be inaccurate, especially when markets are volatile. in addition, there are practical and capital market limitations on our ability to accomplish this matching. due to these and other factors we may need to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a loss in order to satisfy liabilities or be forced to reinvest funds in a lower rate environment.
34
our significant business operations outside the u.s. subject us to foreign exchange risk, which is the risk of loss arising from assets that are invested in a different currency than the related liability, as well as the unhedged portion of the company's earnings from, and capital supporting, operations in a foreign currency. as a u.s.-based company with significant business operations outside of the u.s., particularly in japan, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to these operations, as well as in our investment portfolio. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our profitability, financial condition and cash flows, as well as increase the volatility of our results of operations under u.s. gaap. in the short-term, solvency margins in our japan businesses can also be impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates.
for our international insurance operations, changes in foreign currency exchange rates create risk that we may experience volatility in the u.s. dollar-equivalent earnings and equity of these operations. we seek to manage this risk through various hedging strategies, including the use of foreign currency hedges and through holding u.s. dollar-denominated securities in the investment portfolios of certain of these operations. additionally, our japanese insurance operations offer a variety of non-japanese yen denominated products. we seek to mitigate this risk by holding investments in corresponding currencies. for certain of our international insurance operations outside of japan, we elect to not hedge the risk of changes in our subsidiary equity investments due to foreign exchange rate movements.
for our domestic investment portfolios supporting our u.s. insurance operations and other proprietary investment portfolios, our foreign currency exchange rate risk arises primarily from investments that are denominated in foreign currencies. we manage this risk by hedging substantially all domestic foreign currency-denominated fixed-income investments into u.s. dollars. we generally do not hedge all of the foreign currency risk of our investments in equity securities of unaffiliated foreign entities. the value and liquidity of our foreign currency investments could be adversely affected by local market, economic and financial conditions. for example, our investments denominated in euro could be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions in europe, including due to potential changes in the euro or to the structure or membership of the european union, and in 2016 we experienced volatility in u.k. and other european union related investments as a result of the u.k.'s referendum to exit the european union.
there can be no assurance that our hedging and other strategies will effectively mitigate foreign exchange risk. for a discussion of our hedging program and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our business, see "management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition-impact of foreign currency exchange rates."
guarantees within certain of our products, in particular our variable annuities, are market sensitive and may decrease our earnings or increase the volatility of our results of operations or financial position under u.s. gaap. certain of our products, particularly our variable annuity products, include guarantees of minimum surrender values or income streams for stated periods or for life, which may be in excess of account values. downturns in equity markets, increased equity volatility, increased credit spreads, or (as discussed above) reduced interest rates could result in an increase in the valuation of liabilities associated with such guarantees, resulting in increases in reserves and reductions in net income. we use a variety of hedging and risk management strategies, including product features, to mitigate these risks in part and we may periodically change our strategies over time. these strategies may, however, not be fully effective. in addition, we may be unable or may choose not to fully hedge these risks. hedging instruments may not effectively offset the costs of guarantees or may otherwise be insufficient in relation to our obligations. hedging instruments also may not change in value correspondingly with associated liabilities due to equity market or interest rate conditions, non-performance risk or other reasons. we may choose to hedge these risks on a basis that does not correspond to their anticipated or actual impact upon our results of operations or financial position under u.s. gaap. changes from period to period in the valuation of these policy benefits, and in the amount of our obligations effectively hedged, will result in volatility in our results of operations and financial position under u.s. gaap and the statutory capital levels of our insurance subsidiaries. estimates and assumptions we make in connection with hedging activities may fail to reflect or correspond to our actual long-term exposure from our guarantees. further, the risk of increases in the costs of our guarantees not covered by our hedging and other capital and risk management strategies may become more significant due to changes in policyholder behavior driven by market conditions or other factors. the above factors, individually or collectively, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
our valuation of the liabilities for the minimum benefits contained in many of our variable annuity products requires us to consider the market perception of our risk of non-performance, and a decrease in our own credit spreads resulting from ratings upgrades or other events or market conditions could cause the recorded value of these liabilities to increase, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
liquidity risk as a financial services company, we are exposed to liquidity risk, which is the risk that the company is unable to meet near-term obligations as they come due.
35
liquidity risk is a manifestation of events that are driven by other risk types (market, insurance, investment, operational). a liquidity shortfall may arise in the event of insufficient funding sources or an immediate and significant need for cash or collateral. in addition, it is possible that expected liquidity sources, such as our credit facilities, may be unavailable or inadequate to satisfy the liquidity demands described below.
the company has four primary sources of liquidity exposure and associated drivers that trigger material liquidity demand. those sources are:
â€¢   derivative collateral market exposure: abrupt changes to interest rate, equity, and/or currency markets may increase collateral requirements to counterparties and create liquidity risk for the company.
â€¢   asset liability mismatch: there are liquidity risks associated with liabilities coming due prior to the matching asset cash flows. structural maturities mismatch can occur in activities such as securities lending, where the liabilities are effectively overnight open transactions used to fund longer term assets.
â€¢   wholesale funding. the company depends upon the financial markets for funding (such as through the issuance of commercial paper, securities lending and repurchase arrangements and other forms of borrowings in the capital markets). these sources might not be available during times of stress, or may only be available on unfavorable terms, which can result in a decrease in our profitability and a significant reduction in our financial flexibility.
â€¢   insurance cash flows. the company faces potential liquidity risks from unexpected cash demands due to severe mortality calamity or lapse events. if such events were to occur, the company may face unexpectedly high levels of claim payments to policyholders.
for a discussion of the company's liquidity and sources and uses of liquidity, including information about legal and regulatory limits on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, see "management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition-liquidity and capital resources-liquidity."
operational risk our operations are exposed to the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human error or misconduct, and as a result of external events. an operational risk failure may result in one or more actual or potential impacts to the company.
operational risk types
â€¢   processes - processing failure; failure to safeguard or retain documents/records; errors in valuation/pricing models and processes; project management or execution failures; improper sales practices.
â€¢   systems - failures during the development and implementation of new systems; systems failures.
â€¢   people - internal fraud, breaches of employment law, unauthorized activities; loss or lack of key personnel, inadequate training; inadequate supervision.
â€¢   external events - external crime; outsourcing risk; vendor risk; natural and other disasters; changes in laws/regulations.
â€¢   legal - legal and regulatory compliance failures.
potential impacts
â€¢   financial losses - the company experiences a financial loss. this loss may originate from various causes including, but not limited to, transaction processing errors and fraud.
â€¢   customer impacts - the company may not be able to service customers. this may result if the company is unable to continue operations during a business continuation event or if systems are compromised due to malware or virus.
â€¢   regulatory fines or sanctions - when the company fails to comply with applicable laws or regulations, regulatory fines or sanctions may be imposed. in addition, possible restrictions on business activities may result.
â€¢   legal actions - failure to comply with laws and regulations also exposes the company to litigation risk. this may also result in financial losses.
liabilities we may incur as a result of operational failures are described further under "contingent liabilities" in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements. in addition, certain pending regulatory and litigation matters affecting us, and certain risks to our businesses presented by such matters, are discussed under "contingent liabilities" and "commitments and guarantees, contingent liabilities and litigation and regulatory matters" in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements. we may become subject to additional regulatory and legal actions in the future.
36
key enterprise operational risks - key enterprise operational risks include the following:
we are subject to business continuation risk, which is the risk that our systems and data may be disrupted. we depend heavily on our telecommunication, information technology and other operational systems and on the integrity and timeliness of data we use to run our businesses and service our customers. these systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events or circumstances wholly or partly beyond our control. further, we face the risk of operational and technology failures by others, including clearing agents, exchanges and other financial intermediaries and of vendors and parties to which we outsource the provision of services or business operations. we may experience a business continuation event as a result of:
â€¢   severe pandemic, either naturally occurring or intentionally manipulated pathogens.
â€¢   geo-political risks, including armed conflict and civil unrest.
â€¢   terrorist events.
â€¢   a significant natural or accidental disaster.
we are subject to the risk that we may not adequately maintain information security. there continues to be significant and organized cyber-attack activity against western organizations, including but not limited to the financial services sector. risks related to cyber-attack arise in the following areas:
â€¢   protecting both "structured" and "unstructured" sensitive information is a constant need. however, some risks associated with trusted insiders (i.e., employees, consultants, or vendors who are authorized to access the company's systems) remain and cannot be effectively mitigated using technology alone.
â€¢   unsuspecting employees represent a primary avenue for external parties to gain access to our network and systems. many attacks, even from sophisticated actors, include rudimentary techniques such as coaxing an internal user to click on a malicious attachment or link to introduce malware or steal their username and password.
â€¢   in the past, hackers went after credit and debit card data, which is easy to monetize. as credit card security improves, the hackers will look to other sources of monetization, specifically personally identifiable information or using cyber-attacks or the threat of cyber-attacks to extort money from companies.
â€¢   nation-state sponsored organizations are engaged in cyber-attacks but not necessarily for monetization purposes. nation states appear to be motivated by the desire to gain information about foreign citizens and governments or to influence or cause disruptions in commerce or political affairs. as evidenced by the ability of criminal organizations and nation-states to successfully breach large financial institutions and the u.s. government, no organization is fully immune to cyber-attacks.
â€¢   we have also seen an increase in non-technical attempts to commit fraud or solicit information via call centers and interactive voice response systems, and we anticipate the attempts will become more common.
â€¢   we rely on third parties to provide services as described further below. while we have certain standards for all vendors that provide us services, our vendors, and in turn, their own service providers, may become subject to a security breach, including as a result of their failure to perform in accordance with contractual arrangements.
we may not adequately ensure the privacy of sensitive data. in the course of our ordinary business we collect, store and share with various third-parties (e.g., service providers, reinsurers, etc.) substantial amounts of private and confidential policyholder information, including in some instances sensitive health-related information. we are subject to the risk that the privacy of this information may be compromised, including as a result of an information security breach described above.
third parties (outsourcing providers, vendors and suppliers) present added operational risk to our enterprise. the company's business model relies heavily on the use of third parties to deliver contracted services in a broad range of areas. this presents the risk that the company is unable to meet legal, regulatory, financial or customer obligations because third parties fail to deliver contracted services, or that the company is exposed to reputational damage because third parties operate in a poorly controlled manner. we use affiliates and third-party vendors located outside the u.s. to provide certain services and functions, which also exposes us to business disruptions and political risks as a result of risks inherent in conducting business outside of the u.s.
37
although we distribute our products through a wide variety of distribution channels, we do maintain relationships with certain key distributors. for example, a significant amount of our sales in japan through banks is derived through a single major japanese bank and a significant portion of our sales in japan through life consultants is derived through a single association relationship. we periodically negotiate the terms of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. an interruption in certain key relationships could materially affect our ability to market our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. distributors may elect to reduce or terminate their distribution relationships with us, including for such reasons as adverse developments in our business, adverse rating agency actions or concerns about market-related risks. we are also at risk that key distribution partners may merge, change their business models in ways that affect how our products are sold, or terminate their distribution contracts with us, or that new distribution channels could emerge and adversely impact the effectiveness of our distribution efforts. an increase in bank and broker-dealer consolidation activity could increase competition for access to distributors, result in greater distribution expenses and impair our ability to market products through these channels. consolidation of distributors and/or other industry changes may also increase the likelihood that distributors will try to renegotiate the terms of any existing selling agreements to terms less favorable to us.
in addition, when our products are distributed through unaffiliated firms, we may not be able to monitor or control the manner of their distribution despite our training and compliance programs. if our products are distributed in an inappropriate manner, or to customers for whom they are unsuitable, or distributors of our products otherwise engage in misconduct, we may suffer reputational and other harm to our business. we also have a large captive distribution channel and we are subject to the risk that our monitoring and controls will not detect inappropriate sales practices or misconduct by our own agents.
as a financial services company, we are exposed to model risk, which is the risk of financial loss or reputational damage or adverse regulatory impacts caused by model errors or limitations, incorrect implementation of models, or misuse of or overreliance upon models. models are utilized by our businesses and corporate areas primarily to project future cash flows associated with pricing products, calculating reserves and valuing assets, as well as in evaluating risk and determining capital requirements, among other uses. these models may not operate properly and may rely on assumptions and projections that are inherently uncertain. as our businesses continue to grow and evolve, the number and complexity of models we utilize expands, increasing our exposure to error in the design, implementation or use of models, including the associated input data and assumptions.
strategic risk we are subject to the risk of events that can cause our fundamental business model to change, either through a shift in the businesses in which we are engaged or a change in our execution. in addition, tactical risks may become strategic risks. for example, interest rates remaining low for a long time may, at some point, cause us to change our sales goals, exit a certain business, and/or change our business model.
changes in the regulatory landscape may be unsettling to our business model. new laws and regulations are being considered in the u.s. and our other countries of operation at an increasing pace, as there has been greater scrutiny on financial regulation over the past several years. proposed or unforeseen changes in law or regulation may adversely impact our business. see "business-regulation" for a discussion of certain recently enacted and pending proposals by international, federal and state regulatory authorities and their potential impact on our business, including in the following areas:
â€¢   our regulation as a designated financial company and the associated enhanced prudential standards, many of which are subject to ongoing rule-making.
â€¢   financial sector regulatory reform that may arise out of reports issued by the u.s. treasury.
â€¢   changes in tax law (including u.s. federal, state, and non-u.s.).
â€¢   the dol fiduciary rules.
â€¢   our regulation under u.s. state insurance laws and developments regarding group-wide supervision and capital standards, rbc factors for invested assets and reserves for life insurance, variable annuities and other products.
â€¢   insurer capital standards in japan, korea and other non-u.s. jurisdictions.
â€¢   privacy and cybersecurity regulation.
changes in accounting rules applicable to our business may also have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition. for a discussion of accounting pronouncements and their potential impact on our business, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
technological changes may be unsettling to our business model. we believe there are three aspects of technological change that would significantly impact our business model as described below. there may be other unforeseen changes in technology which may have a significant impact on our business model.

â€¢   interaction with customers. technology is moving rapidly and as it does, it puts pressure on existing business models. some of the changes we can anticipate are increased choices about how customers want to interact with the company or how they want the company to interact with them. evolving customer preferences may drive a need to redesign products. our distribution channels may change to become more automated, at the place and time of the customer's choosing. such changes clearly have the potential to disrupt our business model over the next 10 years.
â€¢   investment portfolio. technology may have a significant impact on the companies in which the company invests. for example, environmental concerns spur scientific inquiry which may re-position the relative attractiveness of wind or sun power over oil and gas. the transportation industry may favor alternative modes of conveyance of goods which may shift trucking or air transport out of favor. consumers may change their purchasing behavior to favor online activity which would change the role of malls and retail properties.
â€¢   medical advances. the company is exposed to the impact of medical advances in two major ways. genetic testing and the availability of that information unequally to consumers and insurers can bring anti-selection risks. specifically, data from genetic testing can give our prospective customers a clearer view into their future, allowing them to select products protecting them against likelihoods of mortality or longevity with more precision. also, technologies that extend lives will challenge our actuarial assumptions especially in the annuity-based businesses.
other factors may be unsettling to our business model. the following items are examples of those which, among others, could have a meaningful impact on our business.
â€¢   changes to either the policies and procedures the company uses to locate guaranteed group annuity customers, or its reserving policies for its guaranteed group annuities, may result in increased operational expenses and complexity, and increases in reserves, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. the company's retirement business provides guaranteed group annuity benefits under group annuity and structured settlement contracts. under our policies and procedures, we use internal and external tools and resources to locate customers covered by our guaranteed group annuity benefits. we also have policies on the development of our reserve estimates, and we believe that we are complying with our policies and procedures and meeting our obligations to customers. the company regularly reviews, tests and enhances the processes and tools used to locate customers, and over time, such processes and tools are expected to continue to evolve. however, in the normal course of business, at any given time there are a small number of customers covered by our guaranteed group annuity benefits that we cannot locate. in light of recent industry focus on missing retirement customers, the company is reviewing this issue closely. ultimately, we could see greater standardization of what may currently be divergent practices across the industry. changes to either the policies and procedures the company uses to locate customers, or its reserving policies, may result in increased operational expenses and complexity, and increases in reserves, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.
â€¢   a downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could potentially, among other things, adversely impact our business prospects, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. for a discussion of our ratings and the potential impact of a ratings downgrade on our business, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-liquidity and capital resources-ratings." we cannot predict what additional actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies, which could adversely affect our business. our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without notice by any rating agency. in addition, a sovereign downgrade could result in a downgrade of our subsidiaries operating in that jurisdiction, and ultimately of prudential financial and our other subsidiaries. for example, in september 2015, s&amp;p downgraded japan's sovereign rating to a+ with a 'stable' outlook citing uncertainties around the strength of economic growth and weak fiscal positions. as a result, s&amp;p subsequently lowered the ratings of a number of institutions in japan, including our japanese insurance subsidiaries. it is possible that japan's sovereign rating could be subject to further downgrades, which would result in further downgrades of our insurance subsidiaries in japan. given the importance of our operations in japan to our overall results, such downgrades could lead to a downgrade of prudential financial and our domestic insurance companies.

â€¢   london inter-bank offered rate (libor) reform may adversely affect the interest rates on and value of certain derivatives and floating rate securities we hold and floating rate securities we have issued, the value and profitability of certain real estate lending and related activities conducted in our investment management business, and any other assets or liabilities whose value may be tied to libor. actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies, as well as ice benchmark administration (the current administrator of libor) may result in changes to the way libor is determined or the establishment of alternative reference rates. for example, on july 27, 2017, the u.k. financial conduct authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021. the u.s. federal reserve, based on the recommendations of the new york federal reserve's alternative reference rate committee (constituted of major derivative market participants and their regulators), has announced its plans to begin publishing, in mid-2018, a secured overnight funding rate ("sofr") which is intended to replace u.s. dollar libor. plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies have also been announced. at this time, it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to these new rates, and the effect of any changes or reforms to libor or discontinuation of libor on new or existing financial instruments to which we have exposure. if libor ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating libor change from current methods for any reason, interest rates on certain derivatives and floating rate securities we hold, securities we have issued, real estate lending and related activities we conduct in our investment management business, and any other assets or liabilities whose value is tied to libor, may be adversely affected. further, any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of libor as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the value of such instruments.
â€¢   the changing competitive landscape may adversely affect the company. in each of our businesses we face intense competition from insurance companies, asset managers and diversified financial institutions, both for the ultimate customers for our products and, in many businesses, for distribution through non-affiliated distribution channels. technological advances, changing customer expectations, including related to digital offerings, or other changes in the marketplace may present opportunities for new or smaller competitors without established products or distribution channels to meet consumers' increased expectations more efficiently than us. fintech and insurtech companies have the potential to disrupt industries globally, and many participants have been partially funded by industry players. for example, in investment management, we expect to see continued pressure on fees given the focus on passive investment and the growth of the robo-advice channel.
â€¢   climate change may increase the severity and frequency of calamities, or adversely affect our investment portfolio. climate change may increase the frequency and severity of weather related disasters and pandemics. in addition, climate change regulation may affect the prospects of companies and other entities whose securities we hold, or our willingness to continue to hold their securities. it may also impact other counterparties, including reinsurers, and affect the value of investments, including real estate investments we hold or manage for others. we cannot predict the long-term impacts on us from climate change or related regulation.
â€¢   market conditions and other factors may adversely impact product sales or increase expenses. examples include:
â—¦   a change in market conditions, such as high inflation and high interest rates, could cause a change in consumer sentiment and behavior adversely affecting sales and persistency of our savings and protection products. conversely, low inflation and low interest rates could cause persistency of these products to vary from that anticipated and adversely affect profitability. similarly, changing economic conditions and unfavorable public perception of financial institutions can influence customer behavior, including increasing claims or surrenders in certain products.
â—¦   sales of our investment-based and asset management products and services may decline, and lapses and surrenders of certain insurance products and withdrawals of assets from investment products may increase if a market downturn, increased market volatility or other market conditions result in customers becoming dissatisfied with their investments or products.
â—¦   changes in our discount rate, expected rate of return, life expectancy, health care cost and assumptions regarding compensation increases for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans may result in increased expenses and reduce our profitability.
â€¢   our reputation may be adversely impacted if any of the risks described in this section are realized. reputational risk could manifest from any of the risks as identified in the company's risk identification process. failure to effectively manage risks across a broad range of risk issues exposes the company to reputational harm. if the company were to suffer a significant loss in reputation, both policyholders and counterparties could seek to exit existing relationships. additionally, large changes in credit worthiness, especially credit ratings, could impact access to funding markets while creating additional collateral requirements for existing relationships. the mismanagement of any such risks may potentially damage our reputational asset. our business is anchored in the strength of our brand, our alignment to our values, and our proven commitment to keep our promises to our customers. any negative public perception, founded or otherwise, can be widely and rapidly shared over social media or other means, and could cause damage to our reputation.

certain of the statements included in this section constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the u.s. private securities litigation reform act of 1995. forward-looking statements are made based on management's current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects upon prudential financial, inc. and its subsidiaries. prudential financial, inc.'s actual results may differ, possibly materially, from expectations or estimates reflected in such forward-looking statements. certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ, possibly materially, from expectations or estimates reflected in such forward-looking statements can be found in the "risk factors" and "forward-looking statements" sections herein. information in this section regarding the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act on prudential financial, inc.'s results of operations and financial condition consists of estimates. these estimates are forward-looking statements based on current interpretations and expectations and may change, possibly materially, as described herein.
overview during the fourth quarter of 2017, we introduced a new organizational structure for our u.s. businesses that reflects our focus on leveraging our mix of businesses and our digital and customer engagement capabilities to expand our value proposition for the benefit of customers and stakeholders. this new organizational structure retains our existing segments but realigns them under new divisions. under the new structure, our principal operations are comprised of five divisions, which together encompass seven segments, and our corporate and other operations. the u.s. individual solutions division consists of our individual annuities and individual life segments. the u.s. workplace solutions division consists of our retirement and group insurance segments. the investment management division is comprised of our investment management segment (formerly named the asset management segment). the international insurance division continues to consist of our international insurance segment, and the closed block division continues to consist of our closed block segment. our corporate and other operations continue to include corporate items and initiatives that are not allocated to business segments and businesses that have been or will be divested. there are no changes to our reporting segments nor to our measure of segment profitability as a result of the new organizational structure.
revenues and expenses we earn our revenues principally from insurance premiums; mortality, expense, asset management and administrative fees from insurance and investment products; and investment of general account and other funds. we earn premiums primarily from the sale of certain individual life insurance, group life and disability insurance, retirement and annuity contracts. we earn mortality, expense, and asset management fees primarily from the sale and servicing of separate account products including variable life insurance and variable annuities, and from the sale and servicing of other products including universal life insurance. we also earn asset management and administrative fees from the distribution, servicing and management of mutual funds, retirement products and other asset management products and services. our operating expenses principally consist of insurance benefits provided and reserves established for anticipated future insurance benefits, general business expenses, dividends to policyholders, commissions and other costs of selling and servicing our products and interest credited on general account liabilities.
profitability our profitability depends principally on our ability to price our insurance and annuity products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the costs associated with providing benefits and administering those products. profitability also depends on, among other items, our actuarial and policyholder behavior experience on insurance and annuity products, and our ability to attract and retain customer assets, generate and maintain favorable investment results, effectively deploy capital and utilize our tax capacity, and manage expenses.
historically, the participating products included in the closed block have yielded lower returns on capital invested than many of our other businesses. as we have ceased offering domestic participating products, we expect that the proportion of the traditional participating products in our in force business will gradually diminish as these older policies age, and we grow other businesses. however, the relatively lower returns to us on this existing block of business will continue to affect our consolidated results of operations for many years.
executive summary industry trends our u.s. and international businesses are impacted by financial markets, economic conditions, regulatory oversight, and a variety of trends that affect the industries where we compete.
46
u.s. businesses financial and economic environment. as discussed further under "impact of a low interest rate environment" below, interest rates in the u.s. remain lower than historical levels, which continue to negatively impact our portfolio income yields and our net investment spread results.
regulatory environment. see "business-regulation" for a discussion of regulatory developments that may impact the company and associated risks, including changes in u.s. tax legislation, the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act, the u.s. department of labor's fiduciary rules and fiduciary rules being developed by other regulators.
demographics. customer demographics continue to evolve and new opportunities present themselves in different consumer segments such as the millennial and multicultural markets. consumer expectations and preferences are changing. we believe existing customers and potential customers are increasingly looking for cost-effective solutions that they can easily understand and access through technology-enabled devices. at the same time, income protection, wealth accumulation and the needs of retiring baby boomers are continuing to shape the insurance industry. a persistent retirement security gap exists in terms of both savings and protection. despite the ongoing phenomenon of the risk and responsibility of retirement savings shifting from employers to employees, employers are becoming increasingly focused on the financial wellness of the individuals they employ.
competitive environment. see "business-" for a discussion of the competitive environment and the basis on which we compete in each of our segments.
international businesses financial and economic environment. our international insurance operations, especially in japan, continue to operate in a low interest rate environment. although the local market in japan has adapted to low interest rates, as discussed under "impact of a low interest rate environment" below, the current reinvestment yields for certain blocks of business in our international insurance operations are now generally lower than the current portfolio yield supporting these blocks of business, which may negatively impact our net investment spread results. the continued low interest rate environment in the u.s. may also impact the relative attractiveness of u.s. dollar-denominated products to yen-denominated products in japan. in addition, we are subject to financial impacts associated with movements in foreign currency rates, particularly the japanese yen. fluctuations in the value of the yen will continue to impact the relative attractiveness of both yen-denominated and non-yen denominated products.
regulatory environment. see "business-regulation" for a discussion of regulatory developments that may impact the company and associated risks, including developing capital standards.
demographics. japan has an aging population as well as a large pool of household assets invested in low-yielding deposit and savings vehicles. the aging of japan's population, along with strains on government pension programs, have led to a growing demand for insurance products with a significant savings element to meet savings and retirement needs as the population prepares for retirement. we are seeing a similar shift to retirement-oriented products across other asian markets, including korea and taiwan, each of which also has an aging population.
competitive environment. see "business-" for a discussion of the competitive environment and the basis on which we compete in each of our segments.
impact of a low interest rate environment as a global financial services company, market interest rates are a key driver of our results of operations and financial condition. changes in interest rates can affect our results of operations and/or our financial condition in several ways, including favorable or adverse impacts to:
â€¢   investment-related activity, including: investment income returns, net interest margins, net investment spread results, new money rates, mortgage loan prepayments and bond redemptions;
â€¢   insurance reserve levels, market experience true-ups, and amortization of both deferred policy acquisition costs ("dac") and value of business acquired ("voba");
â€¢   customer account values, including their impact on fee income;
â€¢   fair value of, and possible impairments on, intangible assets such as goodwill;
â€¢   product offerings, design features, crediting rates and sales mix; and
â€¢   policyholder behavior, including surrender or withdrawal activity.
47
see below for discussions related to: the current interest rate environments in our two largest markets, the united states and japan; the composition of our insurance liabilities and policyholder account balances; and the hypothetical impacts to our results if these interest rate environments are sustained.
u.s. operations excluding the closed block division interest rates in the u.s. continue to remain lower than historical levels, despite the federal reserve board's actions throughout 2017 to raise short-term interest rates by a total of 75 basis points ("bps"). market conditions and events make uncertain the timing, amount and impact of any further monetary policy decisions by the federal reserve. given this continued low rate environment, our current reinvestment yields remain lower than the overall portfolio yield, primarily for our investments in fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans and, as a result, our overall portfolio yields are expected to continue to decline.
for the general account supporting our u.s. individual solutions division, u.s. workplace solutions division, investment management division and our corporate and other operations, we expect annual scheduled payments and prepayments to be approximately 6.8% of the fixed maturity security and commercial mortgage loan portfolios through 2019. the general account for these operations has approximately $195 billion of such assets (based on net carrying value) as of december 31, 2017. as these assets mature, the average portfolio yield for fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loans of approximately 4.2%, as of december 31, 2017, is expected to decline due to reinvesting in a lower interest rate environment.
included in the $195 billion of fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans are approximately $108 billion that are subject to call or redemption features at the issuer's option and have a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4%. of this $108 billion, approximately 65% contain provisions for prepayment premiums. the reinvestment of scheduled payments or prepayments (not subject to a prepayment fee) at rates below the current portfolio yield, including in some cases at rates below those guaranteed under our insurance contracts, will impact future operating results to the extent we do not, or are unable to, reduce crediting rates on in force blocks of business, or effectively utilize other asset/liability management strategies described below, in order to maintain current net interest margins.
the following table sets forth the insurance liabilities and policyholder account balances of our u.s. operations excluding the closed block division, by type, for the date indicated:

the $115 billion above relates to long-duration products such as group annuities, structured settlements and other insurance products that have fixed and guaranteed terms, for which underlying assets may have to be reinvested at interest rates that are lower than portfolio rates. we seek to mitigate the impact of a prolonged low interest rate environment on these contracts through asset/liability management, as discussed further below.
the $56 billion above relates to contracts with crediting rates that may be adjusted over the life of the contract, subject to guaranteed minimums. although we may have the ability to lower crediting rates for those contracts above guaranteed minimums, our willingness to do so may be limited by competitive pressures. the following table sets forth the related account values by range of guaranteed minimum crediting rates and the related range of the difference, in bps, between rates being credited to contractholders as of december 31, 2017, and the respective guaranteed minimums.

(1)   includes approximately $0.9 billion related to contracts that impose a market value adjustment if the invested amount is not held to maturity.
the remaining $15 billion of insurance liabilities and policyholder account balances in these operations relates to participating contracts for which the investment income risk is expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. the crediting rates for these contracts are periodically adjusted based on the return earned on the related assets.
assuming a hypothetical scenario where the average 10-year u.s. treasury rate is 2.70% for the period from january 1, 2018 through december 31, 2019, and credit spreads remain unchanged from levels as of december 31, 2017, we estimate that the unfavorable impact to pre-tax adjusted operating income of reinvesting in such an environment, compared to reinvesting at current average portfolio yields, would be approximately $14 million in 2018 and $43 million in 2019. this impact is most significant in the retirement and individual annuities segments. this hypothetical scenario only reflects the impact related to the approximately $56 billion of contracts shown in the table above, and does not reflect: any benefit from potential changes to the crediting rates on the corresponding contractholder liabilities where the company has the contractual ability to do so, or other potential mitigants such as changes in investment mix that we may implement as funds are reinvested; any impact related to assets that do not directly support our liabilities; any impact from other factors, including but not limited to, new business, contractholder behavior, product modifications, changes in product offerings, changes in competitive conditions or changes in capital markets; or any impact from other factors described below. see "-segment measures" for a discussion of adjusted operating income and its use as a measure of segment operating performance.
in order to mitigate the unfavorable impact that the current interest rate environment has on our net interest margins, we employ a proactive asset/liability management program, which includes strategic asset allocation and hedging strategies within a disciplined risk management framework. these strategies seek to match the characteristics of our products, and to closely approximate the interest rate sensitivity of the assets with the estimated interest rate sensitivity of the product liabilities. our asset/liability management program also helps manage duration gaps, currency and other risks between assets and liabilities through the use of derivatives. we adjust this dynamic process as products change, as customer behavior changes and as changes in the market environment occur. as a result, our asset/liability management process has permitted us to manage the interest rate risk associated with our products through several market cycles. our interest rate exposure is also mitigated by our business mix, which includes lines of business for which fee-based and insurance underwriting earnings play a more prominent role in product profitability.
closed block division substantially all of the $61 billion of general account assets in the closed block division support obligations and liabilities relating to the closed block policies only. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the closed block.

while our international insurance operations have experienced a low interest rate environment for many years, the current reinvestment yields for certain blocks of business in our international insurance operations are generally lower than the current portfolio yield supporting these blocks of business. in recent years, the bank of japan's monetary policy has resulted in even lower and, at times, negative yields for certain tenors of government bonds. our international insurance operations employ a proactive asset/liability management program in order to mitigate, to the extent possible, the unfavorable impact that the current interest rate environment has on our net interest margins. in conjunction with this program, we have not purchased negative yielding assets to support the portfolio and we continue to purchase long-term bonds with tenors of 30 years or greater. additionally, our diverse product portfolio in terms of currency mix and premium payment structure allows us to further mitigate the negative impact from this low interest rate environment. we regularly examine our product offerings and their profitability. as a result, we have repriced certain products, adjusted commissions for certain products and have discontinued sales of other products that do not meet our profit expectations. the impact of these actions, coupled with the strengthening of the yen against the u.s. dollar and introduction of certain new products, has resulted in an increase in sales of u.s. dollar-denominated products relative to products denominated in other currencies. for additional information on sales within our international insurance operations, see "-international insurance division-international insurance-sales results," below.
the following table sets forth the insurance liabilities and policyholder account balances of our japanese operations, by type, for the date indicated:
as ofdecember 31, 2017
($ in billions)
long-duration insurance products with fixed and guaranteed terms                                   $125
contracts with a market value adjustment if invested amount is not held to maturity                  24
contracts with adjustable crediting rates subject to guaranteed minimums                             10
total                                                                                              $159
the $125 billion above is predominantly comprised of long-duration insurance products that have fixed and guaranteed terms, for which underlying assets may have to be reinvested at interest rates that are lower than current portfolio yields. the remaining insurance liabilities and policyholder account balances include $24 billion related to contracts that impose a market value adjustment if the invested amount is not held to maturity and $10 billion related to contracts with crediting rates that may be adjusted over the life of the contract, subject to guaranteed minimums. most of the current crediting rates on these contracts, however, are at or near contractual minimums. although we have the ability in some cases to lower crediting rates for those contracts that are above guaranteed minimum crediting rates, the majority of this business has interest crediting rates that are determined by formula.
assuming a hypothetical scenario within our japanese and korean operations where 2018 new money yields would be 25 basis points lower than projected, and applying these lower new money yields to annualized investment of renewal premiums, proceeds from investment disposition and reinvestment of investment income, we estimate that the unfavorable impact would reduce adjusted operating income in 2018 by approximately $10 to $15 million. this hypothetical scenario excludes first-year premium, single pay premium, multi-currency fixed annuity cash flows, any potential benefit from repricing products, and any impact from other factors, including but not limited to new business, contractholder behavior, changes in competitive conditions, changes in capital markets, and the effect of derivative instruments.
outlook management expects that results in 2018 will continue to benefit from our complementary mix of high-quality protection, retirement and investment management businesses. this business mix provides a diversity in earnings sources, which helps offset variability in business results or fluctuations in market conditions, while offering growth opportunities. while challenges exist in the form of a low interest rate environment (see "impact of a low interest rate environment"), fee compression in certain of our businesses and an evolving regulatory environment (see "business-regulation"), we expect that our choice of businesses coupled with strong execution will produce attractive returns. outlook considerations for each of our divisions include the following:
50
â€¢   u.s. individual solutions. our individual annuities business remains focused on helping its customers meet their investment and retirement needs. we expect continued strong results with near-term returns on assets above our long-term target. in addition, we expect our free cash flow to be high given the stability in our block and the challenged industry-wide sales environment. we have been enhancing our risk management strategy to optimize the mix of derivatives and cash instruments which will cause some downward pressure on returns over time, but is expected to produce less volatile net income and cash flows, particularly in adverse scenarios. in addition, we expect a natural fee rate reduction due to the maturation of the existing block and due to sales of newer products which generally have lower rate structures. furthermore, we expect our recent favorable hedging outcomes to normalize. we expect the combination of these factors to cause our returns on assets to migrate to the long-term target over time. we continue to execute on our product diversification strategy and remain focused on a broad range of outcome-oriented solutions for customers. over the near-term, we expect the challenged industry sales environment to persist, and given a more muted equity growth assumption than in prior years, we expect a slight decline in account values. our individual life business is continuing to execute on its product diversification strategy in order to maintain a diversified product mix and an attractive risk profile. we continue to deepen relationships with distribution partners while developing a more customer-oriented experience. product actions over the last several months could result in a slightly higher portion of sales in term and variable life over the next several quarters, but we remain committed to achieving a diversified product offering.
â€¢   u.s. workplace solutions. in our retirement business we continue to provide products that respond to the needs of plan sponsors to manage risk and control their benefit costs, while ensuring we maintain appropriate pricing and return expectations under changing market conditions. our differentiated capabilities and demonstrated execution in the pension risk transfer business is expected to continue to generate attractive growth opportunities. we expect, however, that growth will not be linear given the episodic nature of larger cases, which is the segment of the market where we are most competitive and where the returns are the most compelling. in addition, while we foresee continuation of the spread and fee compression that we have been experiencing in our full-service business, we believe these are manageable headwinds. in our group insurance business, we are focused on expanding our premier market segment, while maintaining a leadership position in the national segment and deepening our customer relationships through our financial wellness platform. we are seeing benefits from our multi-year underwriting efforts, especially in our disability business where improved claims management and our continued pricing discipline have resulted in improvements to our benefits ratio.
â€¢   investment management. pgim, our investment management business, is making targeted investments to further diversify its product offerings, continue to build a broader international presence, deepen its solutions capability, and further strengthen external recognition as a leading global asset manager. these capabilities will enable pgim to continue to meet our clients' evolving needs and, in turn, to generate flows across multiple asset classes, client segments and geographies. underpinning our growth strategy is our ability to continue to deliver robust investment performance, and to attract and retain high-caliber investment talent. while we are experiencing fee pressure in line with the industry, our average fee yield has remained relatively flat due to new flows coming into higher fee yielding strategies within fixed income, equities and real estate, and because of our diverse business profile.
â€¢   international markets. we continue to concentrate on deepening our presence in japan and other markets in which we currently operate and expanding our distribution capabilities in emerging markets. the returns on our death protection products are largely driven by mortality margins which helps mitigate the exposure of results to interest rates. we have seen a shift in sales mix with a greater emphasis on u.s. dollar-denominated products in japan. we expect this trend to continue. we are also focused on achieving scale in select growth markets outsides of japan. with regard to distribution, we are seeking modest growth in our life planner count in japan but we do expect a decline in gibraltar life consultants as we continue to focus on increasing quality and productivity standards.
in order to capitalize on the growth opportunities in our domestic and international markets highlighted above, we continue to make investments in and across our businesses. we are investing in expanding our distribution capabilities through a focus on customer experience and technology enabled advice and distribution, cross-business collaboration, further development of work site relationships with individuals and expanding our ability to offer relevant products and services to customers through whichever channels they choose. we are also investing in product innovation, through the use of data and digital initiatives to better understand and serve the needs of a customer base with changing demographics, to achieve a goal of offering a broader array of cost effective and easily comprehensible products. in addition, we are making investments in our information technology infrastructure in order to streamline processes and enhance the effectiveness of our administrative systems.
51
while we expect these strategic investments to ultimately generate business growth, they will result in elevated expenses. in addition, we expect the time periods required for these investments to generate returns to vary. these investments are being funded through a combination of operating cost efficiencies and the returns generated by our businesses, and we expect to be able to continue to absorb some of these investment costs through efficiency gains.

2017 to 2016 annual comparison. the $3,495 million increase in "net income (loss) attributable to prudential financial, inc." reflected the following notable items:
â€¢   $2,773 million favorable impact reflecting a tax benefit in the current year compared to a tax expense in the prior year primarily as a result of tax reform (see "-income taxes");
â€¢   $1,927 million net favorable variance, on a pre-tax basis, primarily from higher operating results from our business segments and income in the current period from our divested businesses compared to a loss in the prior year;
â€¢   $1,500 million favorable variance, on a pre-tax basis, reflecting changes to the way we manage interest rate risks for certain products. this variance is primarily attributed to changes in our individual annuities risk management strategy implemented in 2016, whereby we terminated the existing intercompany derivative transactions between our corporate and other operations and individual annuities related to managing interest rate risk and we now manage this risk within the individual annuities business segment (see "-results of operations by segment-corporate and other-capital protection framework" for additional information); and
â€¢   $478 million favorable variance, on a pre-tax basis, from adjustments to dac and other costs as well as reserves, reflecting updates to the estimated profitability of our businesses, including the impact of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. this excludes the impact associated with the variable annuity hedging program discussed below (see "-results of operations by segment-u.s. individual solutions division-individual annuities" for additional information).
partially offsetting these increases in "net income (loss) attributable to prudential financial, inc." were the following items:
â€¢   $2,373 million unfavorable variance, on a pre-tax basis, reflecting the net impact from changes in the value of our embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with certain variable annuities (see "-results of operations by segment-u.s. individual solutions division-individual annuities-variable annuity risks and risk mitigants" for additional information); and

â€¢   $810 million lower net pre-tax realized gains for pfi excluding the closed block division, and excluding the impact of the hedging program associated with certain variable annuities discussed above (see "-realized investment gains and losses" for additional information).
2016 to 2015 annual comparison. the $1,274 million decrease in "net income (loss) attributable to prudential financial, inc." reflected the following notable items:
â€¢   $980 million unfavorable variance, on a pre-tax basis, from adjustments to dac and other costs as well as reserves, reflecting updates to the estimated profitability of our businesses, including the impact of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. this excludes the impact associated with the variable annuity hedging program discussed below (see "-results of operations by segment-u.s. individual solutions division-individual annuities" for additional information);
â€¢   $972 million unfavorable variance, on a pre-tax basis, reflecting our decision to manage a portion of our interest rate risk through our capital protection framework (see "-results of operations by segment-corporate and other-capital protection framework" for additional information); and
â€¢   $479 million lower net pre-tax realized gains for pfi excluding the closed block division, and excluding the impact of the hedging program associated with certain variable annuities, which is discussed below (see "-realized investment gains and losses" for additional information).
partially offsetting these decreases in "net income (loss) attributable to prudential financial, inc." were the following items:
â€¢   $737 million favorable impact of lower tax expense reflecting lower pre-tax income in 2016 compared to 2015; and
â€¢   $660 million favorable variance, on a pre-tax basis, reflecting the net impact from changes in the value of our embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with certain variable annuities and other products (see "-results of operations by segment-u.s. individual solutions division-individual annuities-variable annuity risks and risk mitigants" for additional information).

segment results for 2017 presented above reflect the following:
individual annuities. segment results for 2017 increased in comparison to 2016, primarily reflecting higher asset-based fee income, lower amortization costs and higher net investment spread results. both periods also experienced favorable comparative net impacts from changes in the estimated profitability of the business, including those resulting from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements.
54
individual life. segment results for 2017 decreased in comparison to 2016, primarily reflecting unfavorable comparative net impacts from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, higher general and administrative expenses and an unfavorable impact from mortality experience, net of reinsurance, partially offset by a higher contribution from net investment spread results.
retirement. segment results for 2017 increased in comparison to 2016, reflecting higher net investment spread results and a higher contribution from reserve experience.
group insurance. segment results for 2017 increased in comparison to 2016, reflecting favorable comparative net impacts from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, net favorable underwriting results and higher net investment spread results, partially offset by higher expenses.
investment management. segment results for 2017 increased in comparison to 2016, primarily reflecting higher asset management fees, net of related expenses, and higher other related revenues, net of associated expenses, partially offset by higher expenses.
international insurance. segment results for 2017 increased in comparison to 2016, inclusive of unfavorable net impacts from foreign currency exchange rates and comparatively favorable net impacts from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. excluding these items, segment results increased from the prior year, primarily reflecting the growth of business in force and improved policyholder experience, partially offset by higher expenses, including legal costs and expenses supporting business growth.
corporate and other operations. the results for 2017 reflected a decreased loss in comparison to 2016, driven by higher investment income, net of interest expense, higher income from our qualified pension plan, and lower levels of other corporate expenses.
closed block division. results for 2017 increased in comparison to 2016, primarily driven by an increase in net realized investment gains and related activity, net insurance activity and higher net investment income, partially offset by an increase in the policyholder dividend obligation.
segment measures adjusted operating income. in managing our business, we analyze our segments' operating performance using "adjusted operating income." adjusted operating income does not equate to "income (loss) before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures" or "net income (loss)" as determined in accordance with u.s. gaap, but is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources, and consistent with authoritative guidance, is our measure of segment performance. the adjustments to derive adjusted operating income are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with u.s. gaap, and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies. however, we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our businesses. see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the presentation of segment results and our definition of adjusted operating income.
annualized new business premiums. in managing our individual life, group insurance and international insurance businesses, we analyze annualized new business premiums, which do not correspond to revenues under u.s. gaap. annualized new business premiums measure the current sales performance of the business, while revenues primarily reflect the renewal persistency of policies written in prior years and net investment income, in addition to current sales. annualized new business premiums include 10% of first year premiums or deposits from single pay products. no other adjustments are made for limited pay contracts.
the amount of annualized new business premiums for any given period can be significantly impacted by several factors, including but not limited to: addition of new products, discontinuation of existing products, changes in credited interest rates for certain products and other product modifications, changes in premium rates, changes in tax laws, changes in regulations or changes in the competitive environment. sales volume may increase or decrease prior to certain of these changes becoming effective, and then fluctuate in the other direction following such changes.
55
assets under management. in managing our investment management business, we analyze assets under management (which do not correspond directly to u.s. gaap assets) because the principal source of revenues is fees based on assets under management. assets under management represents the fair market value or account value of assets which we manage directly for institutional clients, retail clients, and for our general account, as well as assets invested in our products that are managed by third-party managers.
account values. in managing our individual annuities and retirement businesses, we analyze account values, which do not correspond to u.s. gaap assets. net sales (redemptions) in our individual annuities business and net additions (withdrawals) in our retirement business do not correspond to revenues under u.s. gaap, but are used as a relevant measure of business activity.
impact of foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exchange rate movements and related hedging strategies as a u.s.-based company with significant business operations outside the u.s., particularly in japan, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate movements that could impact our u.s. dollar-equivalent earnings and shareholder return on equity. we seek to mitigate this impact through various hedging strategies, including the use of derivative contracts and by holding u.s. dollar-denominated assets in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.
the operations of certain of our businesses are subject to currency fluctuations that could materially affect our u.s. dollar-equivalent earnings from period to period, even if earnings on a local currency basis are relatively constant. we enter into forward currency derivative contracts as part of our strategy to effectively fix the currency exchange rates for a portion of our prospective non-u.s. dollar-denominated earnings streams, thereby reducing earnings volatility from foreign currency exchange rate movements. the forward currency hedging program is primarily associated with our insurance operations in japan and korea.
for further information on the hedging strategies used to mitigate the risks of foreign currency exchange rate movements on earnings as well as the u.s. gaap earnings impact from products denominated in non-local currencies, see "-impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on earnings," below.
we utilize a yen hedging strategy that calibrates the hedge level to preserve the relative contribution of our yen-based business to the company's overall return on equity on a leverage neutral basis. we implement this hedging strategy utilizing a variety of instruments, including foreign currency derivative contracts, as discussed above, as well as u.s. dollar-denominated assets and, to a lesser extent, "dual currency" and "synthetic dual currency" assets held locally in our japanese insurance subsidiaries. we may also hedge using instruments held in our u.s. domiciled entities, such as u.s. dollar-denominated debt that has been swapped to yen. the total hedge level may vary based on our periodic assessment of the relative contribution of our yen-based business to the company's overall return on equity.
the table below presents the aggregate amount of instruments that serve to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange movements on our u.s. dollar-equivalent shareholder return on equity from our japanese insurance subsidiaries as of the dates indicated.

(3)   dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments are held by our yen-based entities in the form of fixed maturities and loans with a yen-denominated principal component and u.s. dollar-denominated interest income. the amounts shown represent the present value of future u.s. dollar-denominated cash flows.
the u.s. dollar-denominated investments that hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on u.s. dollar-equivalent earnings and shareholder return on equity from our japanese insurance operations are reported within yen-based entities and, as a result, foreign currency exchange rate movements will impact their value reported within our yen-based japanese insurance entities. we seek to mitigate the risk that future unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements will decrease the value of these u.s. dollar-denominated investments reported within our yen-based japanese insurance entities, and therefore negatively impact their equity and regulatory solvency margins, by having our japanese insurance operations enter into currency hedging transactions. those hedges are with a subsidiary of prudential financial. these hedging strategies have the economic effect of moving the change in value of these u.s. dollar-denominated investments due to foreign currency exchange rate movements from our japanese yen-based entities to our u.s. dollar-based entities.
these u.s. dollar-denominated investments also pay a coupon which is generally higher than what a similar yen-denominated investment would pay. the incremental impact of this higher yield on our u.s. dollar-denominated investments, as well as our dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments, will vary over time, and is dependent on the duration of the underlying investments as well as interest rate environments in both the u.s. and japan at the time of the investments. see "-general account investments-investment results" for a discussion of the investment yields generated by our japanese insurance operations.
impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on earnings the financial results of our international insurance, retirement and investment management segments reflect the impact of intercompany arrangements with our corporate and other operations pursuant to which certain of these segments' non-u.s. dollar-denominated earnings are translated at fixed currency exchange rates. results of our corporate and other operations include any differences between the translation adjustments recorded by the segments at the fixed currency exchange rate versus the actual average rate during the period. in addition, specific to our international insurance segment where we hedge certain currencies, as further discussed below, the results of our corporate and other operations also include the impact of any gains or losses recorded from the forward currency contracts that settled during the period, which include the impact of any over or under hedging of actual earnings that differ from projected earnings.
for international insurance, the fixed currency exchange rates are generally determined in connection with a foreign currency income hedging program designed to mitigate the impact of exchange rate changes on the segment's u.s. dollar-equivalent earnings. pursuant to this program, our corporate and other operations execute forward currency contracts with third parties to sell the net exposure of projected earnings for certain currencies in exchange for u.s. dollars at specified exchange rates. the maturities of these contracts correspond with the future periods (typically on a three-year rolling basis) in which the identified non-u.s. dollar-denominated earnings are expected to be generated. in establishing the level of non-u.s. dollar-denominated earnings that will be hedged through this program, we exclude the anticipated level of u.s. dollar-denominated earnings that will be generated by u.s. dollar-denominated products and investments. for the twelve months ended december 31, 2017, approximately 24% of the segment's earnings were yen-based and, as of december 31, 2017, we have hedged 100%, 73% and 28% of expected yen-based earnings for 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. to the extent currently unhedged, our international insurance segment's future expected u.s. dollar-equivalent of yen-based earnings will be impacted by yen exchange rate movements.
as a result of these arrangements, our international insurance segment's results for 2017, 2016 and 2015 reflect the impact of translating yen-denominated earnings at fixed currency exchange rates of 112, 106 and 91 yen per u.s. dollar, respectively, and korean won-denominated earnings at fixed currency exchange rates of 1130, 1100 and 1120 korean won per u.s. dollar, respectively. we expect our 2018 results to reflect the impact of translating yen-denominated earnings at a fixed currency exchange rate of 111 yen per u.s. dollar and korean won-denominated earnings at a fixed currency exchange rate of 1150 won per u.s. dollar. since determination of the fixed currency exchange rates for a given year is impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates over time, the segment's future earnings will ultimately be impacted by these changes in exchange rates.
for retirement, investment management and certain currencies within international insurance, the fixed currency exchange rates for the current year are predetermined during the third quarter of the prior year using forward currency exchange rates.
the table below presents, for the periods indicated, the increase (decrease) to revenues and adjusted operating income for the international insurance, retirement and investment management segments and for corporate and other operations, reflecting the impact of these intercompany arrangements.

__________
(1)   represents the difference between non-u.s. dollar-denominated earnings translated on the basis of weighted average monthly currency exchange rates versus fixed currency exchange rates determined in connection with the foreign currency income hedging program.
(2)   as of december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the notional amounts of these forward currency contracts within our corporate and other operations were $2.8 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, of which $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, were related to our japanese insurance operations.
impact of products denominated in non-local currencies on u.s. gaap earnings while our international insurance operations offer products denominated in local currency, several also offer products denominated in non-local currencies, most notably our japanese operations, which offer u.s. and australian dollar-denominated products. the non-local currency-denominated insurance liabilities related to these products are supported by investments denominated in corresponding currencies, including a significant portion designated as available-for-sale. while the impact from foreign currency exchange rate movements on these non-local currency-denominated assets and liabilities is economically matched, differences in the accounting for changes in the value of these assets and liabilities due to changes in foreign currency exchange rate movements have historically resulted in volatility in u.s. gaap earnings.
in the first quarter of 2015 we implemented a structure in gibraltar life's operations that disaggregated the u.s. and australian dollar-denominated businesses into separate divisions, each with its own functional currency that aligns with the underlying products and investments. the result of this alignment was to reduce differences in the accounting for changes in the value of these assets and liabilities that arise due to changes in foreign currency exchange rate movements. for the u.s. and australian dollar-denominated assets that were transferred under this structure, the net cumulative unrealized investment gains associated with foreign exchange remeasurement that were recorded in "accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" ("aoci") totaled $6.0 billion and will be recognized in earnings within "realized investment gains (losses), net" over time as these assets mature or are sold. as of december 31, 2017, the remaining net cumulative unrealized investment gains balance related to these assets was $3.9 billion. absent the sale of any of these assets prior to their stated maturity, approximately 8% of the $3.9 billion balance will be recognized in 2018, approximately 9% will be recognized in 2019, and a majority of the remaining balance will be recognized from 2020 through 2024.
accounting policies & pronouncements application of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. management, on an ongoing basis, reviews estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements. if management determines that modifications in assumptions and estimates are appropriate given current facts and circumstances, the company's results of operations and financial position as reported in the consolidated financial statements could change significantly.
the following sections discuss the accounting policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions and require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.
insurance assets deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements
58
we capitalize costs that are directly related to the acquisition or renewal of insurance and annuity contracts. these costs primarily include commissions, as well as costs of policy issuance and underwriting and certain other expenses that are directly related to successfully negotiated contracts. we have also deferred costs associated with sales inducements related to our variable and fixed annuity contracts primarily within our individual annuities segment. sales inducements are amounts that are credited to the policyholders' account balances mainly as an inducement to purchase the contract. for additional information about sales inducements, see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. we generally amortize dac and deferred sales inducements ("dsi") over the expected lives of the contracts, based on our estimates of the level and timing of gross premiums, gross profits, or gross margins, depending on the type of contract. as described in more detail below, in calculating dac and dsi amortization, we are required to make assumptions about investment returns, mortality, persistency, and other items that impact our estimates of the level and timing of gross margins, gross profits, or gross premiums. we also periodically evaluate the recoverability of our dac and dsi. for certain contracts, this evaluation is performed as part of our premium deficiency testing, as discussed further below in "-insurance liabilities-future policy benefits." as of december 31, 2017, dac and dsi for pfi excluding the closed block division were $18.7 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, and dac in our closed block division was $299 million.
amortization methodologies gross premiums. dac associated with the non-participating whole life and term life policies of our individual life segment and the whole life, term life, endowment and health policies of our international insurance segment is primarily amortized in proportion to gross premiums. gross premiums are defined as the premiums charged to a policyholder for an insurance contract.
gross profits. dac and dsi associated with the variable and universal life policies of our individual life and international insurance segments and the variable and fixed annuity contracts of our individual annuities and international insurance segments are generally amortized over the expected lives of these policies in proportion to total gross profits. total gross profits include both actual gross profits and estimates of gross profits for future periods. gross profits are defined as i) amounts assessed for mortality, contract administration, surrender charges, and other assessments plus amounts earned from investment of policyholder balances less ii) benefit claims in excess of policyholder balances, costs incurred for contract administration, interest credited to policyholder balances and other credits. if significant negative gross profits are expected in any period, the amount of insurance in force is generally substituted as the base for computing amortization. for variable annuities in our individual annuities segment, u.s. gaap gross profits and amortization rates also include the impacts of the embedded derivatives associated with certain of the optional living benefit features of our variable annuity contracts and related hedging activities. for additional information on the significant inputs to the valuation models for these embedded derivatives including capital market assumptions and actuarially determined assumptions, see below "-insurance liabilities-future policy benefits." in calculating amortization expense, we estimate the amounts of gross profits that will be included in our u.s. gaap results and in adjusted operating income, and utilize these estimates to calculate distinct amortization rates and expense amounts. we also regularly evaluate and adjust the related dac and dsi balances with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the impact of actual gross profits and changes in our projections of estimated future gross profits on our dac and dsi amortization rates. adjustments to the dac and dsi balances include the impact to our estimate of total gross profits of the annual review of assumptions, our quarterly adjustments for current period experience, and our quarterly adjustments for market performance. each of these adjustments is further discussed below in "-annual assumptions review and quarterly adjustments."
gross margins. dac associated with the traditional participating products of our closed block is amortized over the expected lives of those contracts in proportion to estimated gross margins. gross margins are defined as: i) amounts received from premiums, earned from investment of policyholder balances and other assessments, less ii) benefits claims paid, costs for contract administration, changes in the net level premium reserve for death and endowment benefits, annual policyholder dividends and other credits. we evaluate our estimates of future gross margins and adjust the related dac balance with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the effects of actual gross margins and changes in our expected future gross margins. dac adjustments for these participating products generally have not created significant volatility in our results of operations since many of the factors that affect gross margins are also included in the determination of our dividends to these policyholders and, during most years, the closed block has recognized a cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense in "policyholders' dividends," for the excess of actual cumulative earnings over expected cumulative earnings as determined at the time of demutualization. however, if actual cumulative earnings fall below expected cumulative earnings in future periods, thereby eliminating the cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense, changes in gross margins and dac amortization would result in a net impact to the closed block results of operations. as of december 31, 2017, the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was $1,790 million.
the amortization methodologies for products not discussed above primarily relate to less significant dac and dsi balances associated with products in our group insurance and retirement segments, which comprised approximately 2% of the company's total dac and dsi balances as of december 31, 2017.
annual assumptions review and quarterly adjustments
59
annually, we perform a comprehensive review of the assumptions used in estimating gross profits for future periods. over the last several years, the company's most significant assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future gross profits and the amortization of dac and dsi have been related to lapse experience and other contractholder behavior assumptions, mortality, and revisions to expected future rates of returns on investments. these assumptions may also cause potential significant variability in amortization expense in the future. the impact on our results of operations of changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time.
the quarterly adjustments for current period experience referred to above reflect the impact of differences between actual gross profits for a given period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for that period. to the extent each period's actual experience differs from the previous estimate for that period, the assumed level of total gross profits may change. in these cases, we recognize a cumulative adjustment to all previous periods' amortization, also referred to as an experience true-up adjustment.
the quarterly adjustments for market performance referred to above reflect the impact of changes to our estimate of total gross profits to reflect actual fund performance and market conditions. a significant portion of gross profits for our variable annuity contracts and, to a lesser degree, our variable life policies are dependent upon the total rate of return on assets held in separate account investment options. this rate of return influences the fees we earn, costs we incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefit features related to our variable annuity contracts, as well as other sources of profit. returns that are higher than our expectations for a given period produce higher than expected account balances, which increase the future fees we expect to earn and decrease the future costs we expect to incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefit features related to our variable annuity contracts. the opposite occurs when returns are lower than our expectations. the changes in future expected gross profits are used to recognize a cumulative adjustment to all prior periods' amortization.
the near-term future equity rate of return assumption used in evaluating dac and other costs for our domestic variable annuity and variable life insurance products is derived using a reversion to the mean approach, a common industry practice. under this approach, we consider historical equity returns and adjust projected equity returns over an initial future period of five years (the "near-term") so that equity returns converge to the long-term expected rate of return. if the near-term projected future rate of return is greater than our near-term maximum future rate of return of 15%, we use our maximum future rate of return. as of december 31, 2017, our variable annuities and variable life insurance businesses assume an 8.0% long-term equity expected rate of return and a 3.3% near-term mean reversion equity expected rate of return.
the weighted average rate of return assumptions consider many factors specific to each business, including asset durations, asset allocations and other factors. we generally update the near-term equity rates of return and our estimate of total gross profits each quarter to reflect the result of the reversion to the mean approach. we generally update the future interest rates used to project fixed income returns annually and in any quarter when interest rates vary significantly from these assumptions. as a result of our 2017 annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, we reduced our long-term expectation of the 10-year u.s. treasury rate by 25 basis points and now grade to 3.75% over ten years and we reduced the long-term expected return by 40 basis points on japanese government bonds and now grade to 1.5% over ten years.
these market performance related adjustments to our estimate of total gross profits result in cumulative adjustments to prior amortization, reflecting the application of the new required rate of amortization to all prior periods' gross profits.
value of business acquired in addition to dac and dsi, we also recognize an asset for voba. voba is an intangible asset which represents an adjustment to the stated value of acquired inforce insurance contract liabilities to present them at fair value, determined as of the acquisition date. voba is amortized over the expected life of the acquired contracts using the same methodology and assumptions used to amortize dac and dsi (see "-deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements" above for additional information). voba is also subject to recoverability testing. as of december 31, 2017, voba was $1.6 billion, and included $1.2 billion related to the acquisition from american international group ("aig") of aig star life insurance co., ltd, aig edison life insurance company, aig financial assurance japan k.k. and aig edison service co., ltd. (collectively, the "star and edison businesses") in 2011, and $0.1 billion related to the acquisition of the hartford financial services group's individual life insurance business ("the hartford life business") in 2013. the remaining $0.3 billion primarily relates to previously-acquired traditional life, deferred annuity, defined contribution and defined benefit businesses. the voba associated with the inforce contracts of the star and edison businesses is less sensitive to assumption changes, as the majority is amortized in proportion to gross premiums which are more predictably stable compared to gross profits.
insurance liabilities

future policy benefits future policy benefit reserves, including unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses we establish reserves for future policy benefits to, or on behalf of, policyholders using methodologies prescribed by u.s. gaap. the reserving methodologies used include the following:
â€¢   for most long-duration contracts, we utilize a net premium valuation methodology in measuring the liability for future policy benefits. under this methodology, a liability for future policy benefits is accrued when premium revenue is recognized. the liability, which represents the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums (portion of the gross premium required to provide for all benefits and expenses), is estimated using methods that include assumptions applicable at the time the insurance contracts are made with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation, as appropriate. original assumptions continue to be used in subsequent accounting periods to determine changes in the liability for future policy benefits (often referred to as the "lock-in concept") unless a premium deficiency exists. the result of the net premium valuation methodology is that the liability at any point in time represents an accumulation of the portion of premiums received to date expected to be needed to fund future benefits (i.e., net premiums received to date), less any benefits and expenses already paid. the liability does not necessarily reflect the full policyholder obligation the company expects to pay at the conclusion of the contract since a portion of that obligation would be funded by net premiums received in the future and would be recognized in the liability at that time. we perform premium deficiency tests using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date without provisions for adverse deviation. if the liabilities determined based on these best estimate assumptions are greater than the net reserves (i.e., gaap reserves net of any dac, dsi or voba asset), the existing net reserves are adjusted by first reducing these assets by the amount of the deficiency or to zero through a charge to current period earnings. if the deficiency is more than these asset balances for insurance contracts, we then increase the net reserves by the excess, again through a charge to current period earnings. if a premium deficiency is recognized, the assumptions as of the premium deficiency test date are locked in and used in subsequent valuations and the net reserves continue to be subject to premium deficiency testing. in addition, for limited-payment contracts, future policy benefit reserves also include a deferred profit liability representing gross premiums received in excess of net premiums. the deferred profits are recognized in revenue in a constant relationship with insurance in force or with the amount of expected future benefit payments.
â€¢   for certain contract features, such as those related to guaranteed minimum death benefits ("gmdb"), guaranteed minimum income benefits ("gmib") and no-lapse guarantees, a liability is established when associated assessments (which include all policy charges including charges for administration, mortality, expense, surrender, and other. regardless of how characterized) are recognized. this liability is established utilizing current best estimate assumptions and is based on the ratio of the present value of total expected excess payments over the life of the contract divided by the present value of total expected assessments (i.e., benefit ratio). the liability equals the current benefit ratio multiplied by cumulative assessments recognized to date, plus interest, less cumulative excess payments to date. similar to as described above for dac, the reserves are subject to adjustments based on annual reviews of assumptions and quarterly adjustments for experience, including market performance. these adjustments reflect the impact on the benefit ratio of using actual historical experience from the issuance date to the balance sheet date plus updated estimates of future experience. the updated benefit ratio is then applied to all prior periods' assessments to derive an adjustment to the reserve recognized through a benefit or charge to current period earnings.
â€¢   for certain product guarantees, primarily certain optional living benefit features of the variable annuity products in our individual annuities segment including guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits ("gmab"), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits ("gmwb") and guaranteed minimum income and withdrawal benefits ("gmiwb"), the benefits are accounted for as embedded derivatives using a fair value accounting framework. the fair value of these contracts is calculated as the present value of expected future benefit payments to contractholders less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature. under u.s. gaap, the fair values of these benefit features are based on assumptions a market participant would use in valuing these embedded derivatives. changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives are recorded quarterly through a benefit or charge to current period earnings.
the assumptions used in establishing reserves are generally based on the company's experience, industry experience and/or other factors, as applicable. we typically update our actuarial assumptions, such as mortality, morbidity, retirement and policyholder behavior assumptions, annually, unless a material change is observed in an interim period that we feel is indicative of a long-term trend. generally, we do not expect trends to change significantly in the short-term and, to the extent these trends may change, we expect such changes to be gradual over the long-term. in a sustained low interest rate environment, there is an increased likelihood that the reserves determined based on best estimate assumptions may be greater than the net liabilities.
the following paragraphs provide additional details about the reserves established by each of our segments:
61
international insurance. the reserves for future policy benefits of our international insurance segment, which as of december 31, 2017, represented 45% of our total future policy benefit reserves, primarily relate to non-participating whole life and term life products and endowment contracts, and are generally calculated using the net premium valuation methodology, as described above. the primary assumptions used in determining expected future benefits and expenses include mortality, lapse, morbidity, investment yield and maintenance expense assumptions. in addition, future policy benefit reserves for certain contracts also include amounts related to our deferred profit liability, as described above.
retirement. the reserves for future policy benefits of our retirement segment, which as of december 31, 2017, represented 23% of our total future policy benefit reserves, primarily relate to our non-participating life contingent group annuity and structured settlement products and are generally calculated using the net premium valuation methodology, as described above. the primary assumptions used in establishing these reserves include mortality, retirement, maintenance expense, and investment yield assumptions. in addition, future policy benefit reserves for certain contracts also include amounts related to our deferred profit liability, as described above.
individual annuities. the reserves for future policy benefits of our individual annuities segment, which as of december 31, 2017, represented 4% of our total future policy benefit reserves, primarily relate to reserves for the gmdb and gmib features of our variable annuities, and for the optional living benefit features that are accounted for as embedded derivatives. as discussed above, in establishing reserves for gmdbs and gmibs, we utilize current best estimate assumptions. the primary assumptions used in establishing these reserves generally include annuitization, lapse, withdrawal and mortality assumptions, as well as interest rate and equity market return assumptions. lapse rates are adjusted at the contract level based on the in-the-moneyness of the living benefit and reflect other factors, such as the applicability of any surrender charges. lapse rates are reduced when contracts are more in-the-money. lapse rates are also generally assumed to be lower for the period where surrender charges apply.
the reserves for certain optional living benefit features, including gmab, gmwb and gmiwb are accounted for as embedded derivatives at fair value, as described above. this methodology could result in either a liability or contra-liability balance, given changing capital market conditions and various actuarial assumptions. since there is no observable active market for the transfer of these obligations, the valuations are calculated using internally-developed models with option pricing techniques. the models are based on a risk neutral valuation framework and incorporate premiums for risks inherent in valuation techniques, inputs, and the general uncertainty around the timing and amount of future cash flows. the significant inputs to the valuation models for these embedded derivatives include capital market assumptions, such as interest rate levels and volatility assumptions, the company's market-perceived risk of its own non-performance risk ("npr"), as well as actuarially determined assumptions, including mortality rates and contractholder behavior, such as lapse rates, benefit utilization rates and withdrawal rates. capital market inputs and actual contractholders' account values are updated each quarter based on capital market conditions as of the end of the quarter, including interest rates, equity markets and volatility. in the risk neutral valuation, the initial swap curve drives the total returns used to grow the contractholders' account values. the company's discount rate assumption is based on the libor swap curve adjusted for an additional spread, which includes an estimate of npr. actuarial assumptions, including contractholder behavior and mortality, are reviewed at least annually, and updated based upon emerging experience, future expectations and other data, including any observable market data, such as available industry studies or market transactions such as acquisitions and reinsurance transactions. for additional information regarding the valuation of these optional living benefit features, see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
individual life. the reserves for future policy benefits of our individual life segment, which as of december 31, 2017, represented 5% of our total future policy benefit reserves, primarily relate to term life, universal life and variable life products. for term life contracts, the future policy benefit reserves are generally calculated using the net premium valuation methodology, as described above. the primary assumptions used in determining expected future benefits and expenses include mortality, lapse, and maintenance expense assumptions. for variable and universal life products, which include universal life contracts that contain no-lapse guarantees, reserves for future policy benefits are primarily established using the reserving methodology for gmdb and gmib contracts. as discussed above, in establishing reserves for gmdbs and gmibs, we utilize current best estimate assumptions. the primary assumptions used in establishing these reserves generally include mortality, lapse, and premium pattern, as well as interest rate and equity market return assumptions.
group insurance. the reserves for future policy benefits of our group insurance segment, which as of december 31, 2017, represented 2% of our total future policy benefit reserves, primarily relate to reserves for group life and disability benefits. for short-duration contracts, a liability is established when the claim occurs. the reserves for group life and disability benefits include our liability of $2.6 billion for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses for our group insurance segment as of december 31, 2017, which relates primarily to the group long-term disability product. this liability represents our estimate of future disability claim payments and expenses as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred, but have not yet been reported, as of the balance sheet date. the liability is determined as the present value of expected future claim payments and expenses. the primary assumptions used in determining expected future claim payments are claim termination factors, an assumed interest rate and
62
expected social security offsets. long-term disability claims and claim termination experience may be affected by the economic environment and internal factors such as our claims management process. the remaining reserves for future policy benefits for group life and disability benefits relate primarily to our group life business, and include reserves for waiver of premium, claims in course of settlement and claims incurred but not reported. the waiver of premium reserve is calculated as the present value of future benefits, and utilizes assumptions such as expected mortality and recovery rates. the claims in course of settlement reserve is based on the inventory of claims that have been reported but not yet paid. the claims incurred but not reported reserve is estimated using expected patterns of claims reporting.
corporate and other operations. the reserves for future policy benefits of our corporate & other operations, which as of december 31, 2017, represented 2% of our total future policy benefit reserves, primarily relate to our long-term care products and are generally calculated using the net premium valuation methodology, as described above. most contracts have recorded a premium deficiency reserve, for which we use assumptions as of the most recent premium deficiency reserve establishment. the primary assumptions used in establishing these reserves include interest rate, morbidity, mortality, lapse, premium rate increase and maintenance expense assumptions. in addition, certain less significant reserves for our long-term care products, such as our disabled life reserves, are established using current best estimate actuarial assumptions.
closed block division. the future policy benefit reserves for the traditional participating life insurance products of the closed block division, which as of december 31, 2017, represented 19% of our total future policy benefit reserves are determined using the net premium valuation methodology, as described above. under this method, the future policy benefit reserves are accrued as a level proportion of the premium paid by the policyholder. in applying this method, we use mortality assumptions to determine our expected future benefits and expected future premiums, and apply an interest rate to determine the present value of both the expected future benefit payments and the expected future premiums. the mortality assumptions are based on standard industry mortality tables that were used to determine the cash surrender value of the policies, and the interest rates used are the interest rates used to calculate the cash surrender value of the policies.
profits followed by losses in certain instances, the policyholder liability for a particular line of business may not be deficient in the aggregate to trigger loss recognition, but the pattern of earnings may be such that profits are expected to be recognized in earlier years followed by losses in later years. in these situations, accounting standards require that an additional pfl liability be recognized by an amount necessary to sufficiently offset the losses that would be recognized in later years. the pfl liability is based on our current estimate of the present value of the amount necessary to offset losses anticipated in future periods. because the liability is measured on a discounted basis, there will also be accretion into future earnings through an interest charge, and the liability will ultimately be released into earnings as an offset to future losses. this pfl liability is predominantly associated with certain universal life contracts that measure net gaap reserves using current best estimate assumptions and accordingly, will be updated each quarter using current inforce and market data and as part of the annual assumption update.
policyholders' account balances unearned revenue reserve our unearned revenue reserve ("urr"), reported as a component of "policyholders' account balances," was $2.4 billion as of december 31, 2017. this reserve primarily relates to variable and universal life products within our individual life and international insurance segments and represents policy charges for services to be provided in future periods. the charges are deferred as unearned revenue and are generally amortized over the expected life of the contract in proportion to the product's estimated gross profits, similar to dac and dsi as discussed above.
sensitivities for insurance assets and liabilities the following table summarizes the impact that could result on each of the listed financial statement balances for the specified segments relative to changes in certain assumptions that may be considered reasonably likely to occur. the information below is for illustrative purposes only and considers only the hypothetical direct impact on december 31, 2017 balances of changes in a single assumption and not changes in any combinations of assumptions. the figures below are presented for segments that are expected to experience a significant impact as a result of the corresponding assumption change. changes in excess of those illustrated may occur in any period. a description of the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of each of these financial statement balances is provided further above. for traditional long duration contracts and limited payment contracts, u.s. gaap requires the original assumptions used when the contracts are issued to be locked-in and that those assumptions be used in all future liability calculations as long as the resulting liabilities are adequate to provide for the future benefits and expenses (i.e., there is no premium deficiency). therefore, these products are not reflected in the sensitivity table below unless the hypothetical change in assumption would cause a premium deficiency.
63
the impacts presented within this table do not reflect the related impacts of our asset liability management strategy which seeks to offset the changes in the balances presented within this table and is primarily comprised of investments and derivatives. see further below for a discussion of the estimates and assumptions involved with the application of u.s. gaap accounting policies for these instruments and "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" for hypothetical impacts on related balances as a result of changes in certain significant assumptions.

in the international insurance life planner business and the gibraltar life and other operations as well as the investment management segment, we did not elect to utilize the option for qualitative analysis and therefore completed a quantitative impairment analysis using an earnings multiple approach. the earnings multiple approach indicates the value of a business based on comparison to publicly-traded comparable companies in similar lines of business. each comparable company is analyzed based on various factors, including, but not limited to, financial risk, size, geographic diversification, profitability, adequate financial data, and an actively traded stock price. a multiple of price to earnings is developed for the comparable companies using independent analysts' consensus estimates for each company's 2018 forecasted earnings. the multiples are then aggregated and a mean and median multiple is calculated for the group. the lower of the mean or median multiple is then applied to the 2018 forecasted earnings of the reporting unit to develop a value. a control premium is then added to determine a total estimated fair value for the reporting unit.
in the retirement full service business, we also did not elect to utilize the option for qualitative analysis and therefore completed a quantitative impairment analysis using a discounted cash flow approach. the discounted cash flow approach calculates the value of a business by applying a discount rate reflecting the market expected rate of return of the reporting unit to its projected future cash flows. these projected future cash flows were based on our internal forecasts, an expected growth rate and a terminal value. the reporting unit expected rate of return represents the required rate of return on its total capitalization. the process of deriving reporting unit specific required rates of return begins with the calculation of an overall company weighted average cost of capital, which includes the calculation of the required return on equity using a capital asset pricing model ("capm"). the capm is a generally accepted method for estimating an equity investor's return requirement, and hence a company's cost of equity capital. the calculation using the capm begins with the long-term risk-free rate of return, then applies a market risk premium for large company common stock, as well as company specific adjustments to address volatility versus the market. the company then determines reporting unit specific required rates of return based on their relative volatilities, benchmarks results against reporting unit comparable companies, and ensures that the sum of the reporting unit required returns (after considering the impact of unallocated corporate costs and capital) add up to the overall company required return. this process results in reporting unit specific discount rates which are then applied to the expected future cash flows of the retirement full service business to estimate fair value.
after completion of the first step of the quantitative tests, the fair values exceeded the carrying amounts for each of the four reporting units and we concluded there was no impairment as of december 31, 2017. the investment management, international insurance life planner, gibraltar life and other operations, and retirement full service businesses had estimated fair values that exceeded their carrying amounts, each by at least 55%. completion of the second step of the quantitative analysis is therefore not necessary.
estimating the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process that involves the use of significant estimates by management. for all reporting units tested, market declines or other events impacting the fair value of these businesses, including discount rates, interest rates and growth rate assumptions or increases in the level of equity required to support these businesses, could result in goodwill impairments, resulting in a charge to income.
valuation of investments, including derivatives, and the recognition of other-than-temporary impairments our investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans, equity securities, other invested assets, and derivative financial instruments. derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices or the values of securities or commodities. derivative financial instruments we generally use include swaps, futures, forwards and options and may be exchange-traded or contracted in the over-the-counter ("otc") market. we are also party to financial instruments that contain derivative instruments that are "embedded" in the financial instruments. management believes the following accounting policies related to investments, including derivatives, are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. each of these policies is discussed further within other relevant disclosures related to the investments and derivatives, as referenced below:
â€¢   valuation of investments, including derivatives;
â€¢   recognition of other-than-temporary impairments ("otti"); and
â€¢   determination of the valuation allowance for losses on commercial mortgage and other loans.
65
we present at fair value in the statements of financial position our investments classified as available-for-sale (including fixed maturity and equity securities), investments classified as trading such as our trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities, derivatives and embedded derivatives. for additional information regarding the key estimates and assumptions surrounding the determination of fair value of fixed maturity and equity securities, as well as derivative instruments, embedded derivatives and other investments, see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements and "-valuation of assets and liabilities-fair value of assets and liabilities."
for our investments classified as available-for-sale, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in aoci, a separate component of equity. for our investments classified as trading, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded within "other income." in addition, investments classified as available-for-sale, as well as those classified as held-to-maturity, are subject to impairment reviews to identify when a decline in value is other-than-temporary. for a discussion of our policies regarding other-than-temporary declines in investment value and the related methodology for recording otti of fixed maturity and equity securities, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
commercial mortgage and other loans are carried primarily at unpaid principal balances, net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and expenses and unamortized premiums or discounts and a valuation allowance for losses. for a discussion of our policies regarding the valuation allowance for commercial mortgage and other loans, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering employees who meet specific eligibility requirements. our net periodic costs for these plans consider an assumed discount (interest) rate, an expected rate of return on plan assets, expected increases in compensation levels, mortality and trends in health care costs. of these assumptions, our expected rate of return assumptions and our discount rate assumptions have historically had the most significant effect on our net period costs associated with these plans.
we determine our expected rate of return on plan assets based upon a building block approach that considers inflation, real return, term premium, credit spreads, equity risk premium and capital appreciation as well as expenses, the effect of active management and the effect of rebalancing for the equity, debt and real estate asset mix applied on a weighted average basis to our pension asset portfolio. see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for our actual asset allocations by asset category and the asset allocation ranges prescribed by our investment policy guidelines for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. our assumed long-term rate of return for 2017 was 6.25% for our domestic pension plans and 7.00% for our other postretirement benefit plans. given the amount of plan assets as of december 31, 2016, the beginning of the measurement year, if we had assumed an expected rate of return for both our domestic pension and other domestic postretirement benefit plans that was 100 bps higher or 100 bps lower than the rates we assumed, the change in our net periodic costs would have been as shown in the table below. the information provided in the table below considers only changes in our assumed long-term rate of return given the level and mix of invested assets at the beginning of the measurement year, without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed long-term rate of return.

foreign pension plans represent 5% of plan assets at the beginning of 2017. an increase in expected rate of return by 100 bps would result in a decrease in net periodic pension costs of $6 million; conversely, a decrease in expected rate of return by 100 bps would result in an increase in net periodic pension costs of $5 million.

we determine our discount rate, used to value the pension and postretirement benefit obligations, based upon rates commensurate with current yields on high quality corporate bonds. see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the december 31, 2016 methodology we employed to determine our discount rate for 2017. our assumed discount rate for 2017 was 4.15% for our domestic pension plans and 4.05% for our other domestic postretirement benefit plans. given the amount of pension and postretirement obligations as of december 31, 2016, the beginning of the measurement year, if we had assumed a discount rate for both our domestic pension and other postretirement benefit plans that was 100 bps higher or 100 bps lower than the rates we assumed, the change in our net periodic costs would have been as shown in the table below. the information provided in the table below considers only changes in our assumed discount rate without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed discount rate.

foreign pension plans represent 14% of plan obligations at the beginning of 2017. an increase in discount rate by 100 bps would result in a decrease in net periodic pension costs of $26 million; conversely, a decrease in discount rate by 100 bps would result in an increase in net periodic pension costs of $9 million.
given the application of the authoritative guidance for accounting for pensions, and the deferral and amortization of actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in our assumed discount rate, the change in net periodic pension cost arising from an increase in the assumed discount rate by 100 bps would not always be expected to equal the change in net periodic pension cost arising from a decrease in the assumed discount rate by 100 bps.
for a discussion of our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate for our qualified pension plan in 2017, see "-results of operations by segment-corporate and other."
for purposes of calculating pension income from our own qualified pension plan for the year ended december 31, 2018, we will decrease the discount rate to 3.65% from 4.15% in 2017. the expected rate of return on plan assets will remain unchanged at 6.25%, and the assumed rate of increase in compensation will remain unchanged at 4.5%.
in addition to the effect of changes in our assumptions, the net periodic cost or benefit from our pension and other postretirement benefit plans may change due to factors such as actual experience being different from our assumptions, special benefits to terminated employees, or changes in benefits provided under the plans.
at december 31, 2017, the sensitivity of our domestic and foreign pension and postretirement obligations to a 100 basis point change in discount rate was as follows:

taxes on income our effective tax rate is based on income, non-taxable and non-deductible items, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. the drd is a major reason for the difference between the company's effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate. the drd is an estimate that incorporates the prior and current year information, as well as the current year's equity market performance. both the current estimate of the drd and the drd in future periods can vary based on factors such as, but not limited to, changes in the amount of dividends received
67
that are eligible for the drd, changes in the amount of distributions received from underlying fund investments, changes in the account balances of variable life and annuity contracts, and the company's taxable income before the drd.
in december 2017, sec staff issued "sab 118, income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act" ("sab 118"), which allows the registrants to record provisional amounts during a 'measurement period' not to extend beyond one year. under the relief provided by sab 118, a company can recognize provisional amounts when it does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the change in tax law. see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of provisional amounts related to the tax act of 2017 included in "total income tax expense (benefit) before equity in earnings of operating joint ventures" in 2017.
the tax act of 2017 includes a provision causing post-1986 unremitted foreign earnings of at least 10% owned non-u.s. affiliates to be included in the company's u.s. income tax base, with an election to pay the associated tax on an eight-year installment basis. unremitted foreign earnings from certain operations in foreign jurisdictions that impose a withholding tax on dividends are considered to be permanently reinvested for purposes of determining the applicable withholding tax expense. see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of unremitted earnings for which the company provides u.s. income taxes.
an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by one percentage point would have resulted in a decrease or increase in our 2017 "total income tax expense (benefit)" of $65 million.
contingencies a contingency is an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved upon the occurrence of future events. under u.s. gaap, accruals for contingencies are required to be established when the future event is probable and its impact can be reasonably estimated, such as in connection with an unresolved legal matter. the initial reserve reflects management's best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and, ultimately, when the matter is brought to closure.
other accounting policies accounting for certain reinsurance contracts in our individual life business during the second quarter of 2017, we recognized a charge of $237 million in our individual life segment, reflecting a change in our estimate of reinsurance cash flows associated with universal life products as well as a change in our method of reflecting these cash flows in the financial statements. under our previous method of accounting, with the exception of recoveries pertaining to no lapse guarantees, we generally recognized reinsurance cash flows (e.g., premiums and recoveries) as they occurred. under our new method, the expected reinsurance cash flows are recognized more ratably over the life of the underlying reinsured policies. in conjunction with this change, we revised how reinsurance is reflected in estimated gross profits used for the amortization of urr, dac and voba. the change represents a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle and is included within our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. the change in accounting estimate reflected insights gained from revised cashflow modeling enabled by a systems conversion, which prompted the change to a preferable accounting method. we view this new methodology as preferable as we believe it better reflects the economics of our reinsurance transactions by aligning the results of our reinsurance activity more closely to the underlying direct insurance activity and by better reflecting the profit pattern of this business for purposes of the amortization of the balances noted above.
adoption of new accounting pronouncements there are no new critical accounting estimates resulting from new accounting pronouncements adopted during 2017. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of newly adopted accounting pronouncements and accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted.

the individual annuities segment includes both variable and fixed annuities that may include optional guaranteed living benefits riders (e.g., guaranteed minimum income benefits ("gmib"), guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits ("gmab"), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits ("gmwb"), and guaranteed minimum income and withdrawal benefits ("gmiwb")), and/or guaranteed minimum death benefits ("gmdb"). we also offer fixed annuities that provide a guarantee of principal and interest credited at rates we determine, subject to certain contractual minimums. we derive our revenue mainly from fee income generated on variable annuity account values, as the investment return on these contractholder funds is generally attributed directly to the contractholder. we also earn investment income on general account assets supporting annuity account values and certain other management fees. our expenses primarily consist of interest credited and other benefits to contractholders, amortization of dac and other costs, non-deferred expenses related to the selling and servicing of the various products we offer, costs of managing certain risks associated with these products, changes in the reserves for benefit guarantees and other general business expenses. these drivers of our business results are generally included in adjusted operating income, with exceptions related to certain guarantees, as discussed below.
the u.s. gaap accounting and our adjusted operating income treatment for our guarantees differ depending upon the specific contractual features. under u.s. gaap, the reserves for gmdb and gmib are calculated based on best estimates applying our actuarial and capital markets return assumptions in accordance with an insurance fulfillment accounting framework. under this framework, a liability is established over time representing the portion of fees collected that is expected to be used to satisfy the obligation to pay benefits in future periods. the risks associated with these benefit features are retained and results are included in adjusted operating income in a manner generally consistent with u.s. gaap.
in contrast, certain of our guaranteed living benefit riders (e.g., gmab, gmwb and gmiwb) are accounted for under u.s. gaap as embedded derivatives and reported using a fair value accounting framework. these benefit features are carried at fair value, based on estimates of assumptions a market participant would use in valuing these embedded derivatives, and the change in fair value during each reporting period is recorded within "realized investment gains (losses), net." for purposes of measuring segment performance, adjusted operating income excludes the changes in fair value and instead reflects the performance of these riders using an insurance fulfillment accounting framework. under this framework, adjusted operating income recognized each period reflects the rider fees earned during the period, less the portion of such fees estimated to be required to cover future benefit payments and hedging costs. for more information on how we determine the portion of fees needed to cover estimated future benefit payments and hedging costs, see "variable annuity risks and risk mitigants" below.

adjusted operating income
2017 to 2016 annual comparison. adjusted operating income increased $433 million. excluding the impacts of changes in the estimated profitability of the business, discussed below, adjusted operating income increased $388 million. the increase was primarily driven by higher asset-based fee income, net of associated costs, lower amortization costs and reserve provisions, and higher net investment spread results. the increase in asset-based fee income, net of a related increase in asset-based commissions, reflects higher average variable annuity account values due to market appreciation as well as the impact of greater efficiencies in managing product risks associated with the asset liability management ("alm") strategy that was implemented in the third quarter of 2016. the increase in net investment spread results reflects higher investment income on non-coupon investments as well as a higher level of invested assets.
69
the impacts of changes in the estimated profitability of the business include adjustments to the amortization of dac and other costs as well as to the reserves for certain living and/or death benefit features of our variable annuity products. these adjustments resulted in a net benefit of $183 million and $138 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. the net benefits primarily reflected the net impact of equity market performance on contractholder accounts and hedge effectiveness relative to our assumptions, as well as a net benefit resulting from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements.
2016 to 2015 annual comparison. adjusted operating income decreased $32 million. excluding the impacts of changes in the estimated profitability of the business, discussed below, adjusted operating income decreased $8 million. the decrease was primarily driven by lower asset-based fee income, net of associated costs, as well as higher general and administrative expenses including business growth initiatives. the decrease in asset-based fee income, net of a related decrease in asset-based commissions, was driven by a decline in average variable annuity account values and the decrease in the average effective fee rate as fee rates on recent sales are generally lower than fee rates on the inforce block. this decrease was partially offset by an increase due to greater efficiency in managing product risks associated with a recently implemented asset-liability management strategy discussed below. partially offsetting this net decline were increases in net investment income driven by higher income on non-coupon investments and higher invested assets, as well as lower amortization costs and lower interest expense. this net decline was also partially offset by the absence of certain costs for contract cancellations incurred in 2015.
adjustments to the amortization of dac and other costs and to the reserves for certain living and/or death benefit features of our variable annuity products resulted in a net benefit of $138 million and $162 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. the net benefits primarily reflected the net impact of equity market performance on contractholder accounts and hedge effectiveness (beginning in the third quarter of 2016 as a result of our new alm strategy) relative to our assumptions, as well as a net benefit resulting from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements.
revenues, benefits and expenses
2017 to 2016 annual comparison. revenues increased $444 million. excluding an $85 million net increase related to the impacts of certain changes in our estimated profitability of the business, as discussed above, revenues increased $359 million. higher average variable annuity account values and the impact from refinements to our risk management strategy drove increases in policy charges and fee income, and asset management and service fees and other income. the increase in net investment income was driven by higher income from non-coupon investments and a higher level of invested assets.
benefits and expenses increased $11 million. excluding a $40 million net increase related to the impacts of certain changes in our estimated profitability of the business, as discussed above, benefits and expenses decreased $29 million, primarily driven by a decrease in policyholders' benefits, including changes in reserves. partially offsetting this decrease were higher general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, primarily driven by higher asset management costs and higher asset-based commissions due to higher average account values, as well as from higher net operating expenses, including those supporting business growth initiatives.
2016 to 2015 annual comparison. revenues decreased $29 million. excluding a $5 million net decrease related to the impacts of certain changes in our estimated profitability of the business, as discussed above, revenues decreased $24 million, driven by a decrease in policy charges and fee income, asset management and service fees and other income, primarily due to a decline in average variable annuity account values. partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in net investment income driven by higher income on non-coupon investments and higher invested assets, and an increase in premiums reflecting an increase in annuitizations of our variable annuity contracts, with offsets in policyholders' benefits, as discussed below.
benefits and expenses increased $3 million. excluding a $19 million net increase related to the impacts of certain changes in our estimated profitability of the business, as discussed above, benefits and expenses decreased $16 million. interest credited to policyholders' account balances and amortization of dac decreased $21 million and $12 million, respectively, driven by lower fee income, as discussed above. general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, decreased $10 million driven by lower asset management costs and lower asset-based commissions due to lower average account values, partially offset by higher operating expenses. partially offsetting these decreases was a $25 million increase in policyholders' benefits, including changes in reserves, primarily reflecting an increase in annuitizations of our variable annuity contracts with offsets in premiums, as discussed above.
account values
70
account values are a significant driver of our operating results. since most fees are determined by the level of separate account assets, fee income varies according to the level of account values. additionally, our fee income generally drives other items such as the pattern of amortization of dac and other costs. account values are driven by net flows from new business sales, surrenders, withdrawals and benefit payments, policy charges and the impact of positive or negative market value changes. the annuity industry's competitive and regulatory landscapes, which have been dynamic over the last few years, may impact our net flows, including new business sales. the following table sets forth account value information for the periods indicated.

2017 to 2016 annual comparison. the increase in account values during 2017 was predominantly driven by favorable changes in the market value of contractholder funds. net sales for 2017 decreased compared to 2016 reflecting lower gross sales and higher surrenders and withdrawals. the decline in gross sales for 2017 compared to 2016 was largely driven by the continued impact stemming from the evolving dol fiduciary rules and an industry shift away from variable annuity products.
2016 to 2015 annual comparison. the increase in account values during 2016 was largely driven by favorable changes in the market value of contractholder funds, partially offset by contract charges on contractholder accounts and benefit payments. net sales for 2016 decreased compared to 2015 reflecting lower gross sales partially offset by lower surrenders and withdrawals. the decline in gross sales for 2016 compared to 2015 was largely driven by decreased sales of our prudential premierÂ® retirement variable annuity with "highest daily" benefit riders and prudential premierÂ® investment variable annuity ("ppi"). the declines in gross sales were partially offset by increases in sales of our prudential defined income variable annuity ("pdi") product.
variable annuity risks and risk mitigants the primary risk exposures of our variable annuity contracts relate to actual deviations from, or changes to, the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products, including capital markets assumptions such as equity market returns, interest rates and market volatility, along with actuarial assumptions such as contractholder mortality, the timing and amount of annuitization and withdrawals, and contract lapses. for these risk exposures, achievement of our expected returns and profitability is subject to the risk that actual experience will differ from the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products. we currently manage our exposure to certain risks driven by fluctuations in capital markets primarily through a combination of product design features, an asset liability management strategy, a capital hedge program and external reinsurance.
product design features
71
a portion of the variable annuity contracts that we offer include an automatic rebalancing feature, also referred to as an asset transfer feature. this feature is implemented at the contract level, and transfers assets between certain variable investment sub-accounts selected by the annuity contractholder and, depending on the benefit feature, a fixed-rate account in the general account or a bond fund sub-account within the separate accounts. the automatic rebalancing feature associated with currently-sold highest daily benefit products uses a designated bond fund sub-account within the separate accounts. the transfers are based on a static mathematical formula used with the particular benefit which considers a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the impact of investment performance on the contractholder's total account value. the objective of the automatic rebalancing feature is to reduce our exposure to equity market risk and market volatility. other product design features we utilize include, among others, asset allocation restrictions, minimum issuance age requirements and certain limitations on the amount of contractholder deposits, as well as a required minimum allocation to our general account for certain of our products. we continue to introduce products that diversify our risk profile and have incorporated provisions in product design allowing frequent revisions of key pricing elements for certain of our products. in addition, there is diversity in our fee arrangements, as certain fees are primarily based on the benefit guarantee amount, the contractholder account value and/or premiums, which helps preserve certain revenue streams when market fluctuations cause account values to decline.
asset liability management ("alm") strategy (including fixed income instruments and derivatives)
under our historical hedging program to manage certain capital market risks associated with certain variable annuity living benefit guarantees, we utilized the u.s. gaap valuation, with certain modifications, to derive a hedge target that was more reflective of our best estimate of future benefit payments, net of fees collected. derivative positions were entered into that sought to offset the change in value of the hedge target.
during the third quarter of 2016, we implemented a new alm strategy that utilizes a combination of both traditional fixed income instruments and derivatives to help defray potential claims associated with our variable annuity living benefit guarantees. the economic liability we manage with this alm strategy consists of expected living benefit claims under less severe market conditions, which are managed through the accumulation of fixed income instruments, and potential living benefit claims resulting from more severe market conditions, which are hedged using derivative instruments. for the portion of our alm strategy executed with derivatives, we enter into a range of exchange-traded, cleared, and otc equity and interest rate derivatives, including, but not limited to: equity and treasury futures; total return and interest rate swaps; and options, including equity options, swaptions, and floors and caps. the intent of this strategy is to more efficiently manage the capital and liquidity associated with these products while continuing to mitigate fluctuations in net income due to movements in capital markets.
the change in hedge strategy had no impact on how we value or account for the living benefit guarantees under u.s. gaap. however, under the alm strategy that began in the third quarter of 2016, adjusted operating income includes the fees earned that are in excess of the estimated portion of fees required to cover expected claims and hedge costs for the economic liability. the portion of fees required to cover such costs is updated quarterly to reflect updated estimates and actual experience. the effectiveness of our hedging program as measured by comparing the change in value of our hedging assets to the change in value of the liability we are attempting to hedge will ultimately be reflected in adjusted operating income over time through the inclusion of actual hedge costs. expected costs are updated periodically along with our expectation of claims. for adjusted operating income purposes, dac and other costs are fully amortized over the life of the contracts proportional to our actual and estimated gross profits under the adjusted operating income framework described above. overall, we generally expect this strategy to result in a higher portion of fees being recognized in adjusted operating income than under our prior strategy.
the following table provides a reconciliation between the liability reported under u.s. gaap and the economic liability we manage through our alm strategy.

as of december 31, 2017, our fixed income instruments and derivative assets exceed the economic liability within the entities in which the risks reside.
72
under our alm strategy, we expect differences in the u.s. gaap net income impact between the changes in value of the fixed income instruments and derivatives, as compared to the changes in the embedded derivative liability these assets support. these differences can be primarily attributed to three distinct areas:
â€¢   different valuation methodologies in measuring the liability we intend to cover with fixed income instruments and derivatives versus the liability reported under u.s. gaap-the valuation methodology utilized in estimating the economic liability we intend to defray with fixed income instruments and derivatives is different from that required to be utilized to measure the liability under u.s. gaap. the valuation of the economic liability excludes certain items that are included within the u.s. gaap liability, such as npr (in order to maximize protection irrespective of the possibility of our own default), as well as risk margins (required by u.s. gaap but different from our best estimate).
â€¢   different accounting treatment between liabilities and assets supporting those liabilities-under u.s. gaap, changes in value of the embedded derivative liability and derivative instruments used to hedge a portion of the economic liability are immediately reflected in net income. in contrast, changes in fair value of fixed income instruments that support a portion of the economic liability are designated as available-for-sale and are recorded as unrealized gains (losses) in other comprehensive income rather than within net income.
â€¢   general hedge results-for the derivative portion of the alm strategy, the net hedging impact (the extent to which the changes in value of the hedging instruments offset the change in value of the portion of the economic liability we are hedging) may be impacted by a number of factors including: cash flow timing differences between our hedging instruments and the corresponding portion of the economic liability we are hedging, basis differences attributable to actual underlying contractholder funds to be hedged versus hedgeable indices, rebalancing costs related to dynamic rebalancing of hedging instruments as markets move, certain elements of the economic liability that may not be hedged (including certain actuarial assumptions), and implied and realized market volatility on the hedge positions relative to the portion of the economic liability we seek to hedge.
the following table illustrates the net impact to our consolidated statements of operations from changes in the u.s. gaap embedded derivative liability and hedge positions under the alm strategy, and the related amortization of dac and other costs, that are excluded from adjusted operating income.

(1)   positive amount represents income; negative amount represents a loss.
(2)   net hedging impact represents the difference between the change in fair value of the risk we seek to hedge using derivatives and the change in fair value of the derivatives utilized with respect to that risk.
(3)   excludes $0 million, $(1,523) million and $(585) million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing the impact of managing interest rate risk through capital management strategies other than hedging of particular exposures through september 30, 2016. because this decision was based on the capital considerations of the company as a whole, the impact was reported in corporate and other operations. see "-corporate and other."
(4)   represents risk margins and valuation methodology differences between the economic liability managed by the alm strategy and the u.s. gaap liability, as well as the portion of the economic liability managed with fixed income instruments.
the net loss of $719 million for 2017 primarily reflected the net impact of a $793 million loss from changes in the u.s. gaap embedded derivative and hedge positions, predominantly driven by a decrease in the npr adjustment due to tightening of credit spreads used in measuring our living benefits contracts. partially offsetting this decrease were an increase in the portions of the u.s. gaap liability before npr that are excluded from our hedge target and, to a lesser extent, a benefit from net hedging impacts, primarily driven by fund outperformance and favorable liability basis.
73
the net gain of $1,654 million for 2016 primarily reflected the impact of a $1,455 million benefit from our annual review and update of assumptions, driven by modifications to both our actuarial assumptions, including updates to expected withdrawal rates, as well as economic assumptions. the net gain also reflected the changes in the portions of the u.s. gaap liability before npr that are excluded from our hedge target. this impact was partially offset by changes in the npr adjustment, primarily driven by tightening of credit spreads. to a lesser extent, results also reflected net hedging impacts, primarily driven by unfavorable liability basis. each of these items had corresponding partial offsets included in the related impacts to amortization of dac and other costs. amortization of dac and other costs also included a benefit of $515 million related to changes in our estimate of total gross profits as a result of the implementation of the new alm strategy in the third quarter of 2016 described above.
the net gain of $894 million for 2015 primarily reflected a $2,243 million net benefit from the change in the npr adjustment, driven by net increases in the base embedded derivative liability before npr primarily due to declining interest rates and widening credit spreads. this impact was partially offset by a $547 million net charge from changes in the value of our historically defined hedge target, and related hedge positions, primarily driven by fund underperformance relative to indices and unfavorable liability basis. each of these items resulted in partial offsets included in the $701 million related charge to the amortization of dac and other costs. the net charge from the impact of assumption updates and other refinements of $34 million resulted from our annual review and update of assumptions, primarily driven by modifications to our actuarial assumptions and other refinements. results also reflected the changes in the portions of the u.s. gaap liability that are excluded from our historically defined hedge target, net of related impacts to the amortization of dac and other costs.
for information regarding the capital protection framework we use to evaluate and support the risks of the alm strategy, see "-liquidity and capital resources-capital."
through march 31, 2016, we reinsured living benefit guarantees issued by our domestic statutory life insurance companies to a captive reinsurance company, pruco reinsurance, ltd. ("pruco re"), in order to facilitate the capital markets hedging program for these living benefit guarantees. effective april 1, 2016, these living benefit guarantees and certain retirement products were recaptured and then reinsured to certain of our domestic statutory life insurance companies. the alm strategy described above is executed within these domestic insurance companies. after the foregoing transactions, pruco re no longer had any material active reinsurance with affiliates. on september 30, 2016, pruco re was merged with and into prudential annuities life assurance corporation ("palac").
capital hedge program during 2017, we commenced a capital hedge program within the individual annuities segment to further hedge equity market impacts. the program is intended to protect a portion of the overall capital position of the variable annuities business against its exposure to the equity markets. the capital hedge program is conducted using equity derivatives which include equity call and put options, total return swaps and futures contracts. the changes in value of these derivatives are recognized in adjusted operating income over the expected duration of the capital hedge program.
external reinsurance as of december 31, 2017, $3.2 billion of hdi v.3.0 account values are reinsured to union hamilton reinsurance ltd., an external counterparty, pursuant to a quota share agreement that covered approximately 50% of new business between april 1, 2015 and december 31, 2016. hdi v.3.0 is the current version of our "highest daily" living benefits guarantee that is available with our prudential premierÂ® retirement variable annuity. new sales of hdi v.3.0 subsequent to december 31, 2016 are not covered by this external reinsurance agreement.
product specific risks and risk mitigants for certain living benefits guarantees, claims will primarily represent the funding of contractholder lifetime withdrawals after the cumulative withdrawals have first exhausted the contractholder account value. due to the age of the in force block, limited claim payments have occurred to date, and they are not expected to increase significantly within the next five years, based upon current assumptions. the timing and amount of future claims will depend on actual returns on contractholder account value and actual contractholder behavior relative to our assumptions. the majority of our current living benefits guarantees provide for guaranteed lifetime contractholder withdrawal payments inclusive of a "highest daily" contract value guarantee. our pdi variable annuity complements our variable annuity products with the highest daily benefit and provides for guaranteed lifetime contractholder withdrawal payments, but restricts contractholder asset allocation to a single bond fund sub-account within the separate accounts.
74
the majority of our variable annuity contracts with living benefits guarantees, and all new contracts sold with our highest daily living benefits feature, include risk mitigants in the form of an automatic rebalancing feature and/or inclusion in our alm strategy. we may also utilize external reinsurance as a form of additional risk mitigation. the risks associated with the guaranteed benefits of certain legacy products that were sold prior to our development of the automatic rebalancing feature are also managed through our alm strategy. certain legacy gmab products include the automatic rebalancing feature, but are not included in the alm strategy. the pdi product and contracts with the gmib feature have neither risk mitigant. certain risks associated with pdi are managed through the limitation of contractholder asset allocations to a single bond fund sub-account.
for our gmdbs, we provide a benefit payable in the event of death. our base gmdb is generally equal to a return of cumulative deposits adjusted for any partial withdrawals. certain products include an optional enhanced gmdb based on the greater of a minimum return on the contract value or an enhanced value. we have retained the risk that the total amount of death benefit payable may be greater than the contractholder account value; however, a substantial portion of the account values associated with gmdbs are subject to an automatic rebalancing feature because the contractholder also selected a living benefit guarantee which includes an automatic rebalancing feature. all of the variable annuity account values with living benefit guarantees also contain gmdbs. the living and death benefit features for these contracts cover the same insured life and, consequently, we have insured both the longevity and mortality risk on these contracts.
the following table sets forth the risk management profile of our living benefit guarantees and gmdb features as of the periods indicated.

2017 to 2016 annual comparison. adjusted operating income decreased $270 million, primarily reflecting unfavorable comparative net impacts from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. results for 2017 included a $653 million net charge from this annual review, mainly driven by a charge related to the unfavorable impacts for universal life and variable life products from modeling enhancements and other refinements related to a valuation systems conversion, including a net charge related to a change in the method of accounting for reinsurance associated with certain long-duration insurance contracts (see "-accounting policies & pronouncements-application of critical accounting estimates-other accounting policies-accounting for certain reinsurance contracts in our individual life business"), as well as unfavorable lapse rate assumptions primarily for universal life products. results for 2016 included a $420 million net charge from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, mainly driven by a charge to accrue a liability to offset the present value of losses expected to be recognized in later years (see "profits followed by losses" included in "-accounting policies & pronouncements" above) and a charge related to an out of period adjustment (see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements), partially offset by a net benefit from the impacts of other refinements. excluding these impacts, adjusted operating income decreased $37 million, primarily reflecting the unfavorable ongoing impact of our second quarter 2017 annual review and update of assumptions and other refinements, higher general and administrative expenses, including expenses related to business growth initiatives, and an unfavorable impact from mortality experience, net of reinsurance. these decreases were partially offset by a higher contribution from net investment spread results.
2016 to 2015 annual comparison. adjusted operating income decreased $556 million, primarily reflecting unfavorable comparative net impacts from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. results for 2016 included a $420 million net charge from these impacts, as discussed above. results for 2015 included a $68 million net benefit from our annual review and update of assumptions and other refinements, mainly driven by net favorable modifications to our economic and actuarial assumptions. excluding these impacts, adjusted operating income decreased $68 million, primarily driven by less favorable mortality experience, net of reinsurance, and higher general and administrative expenses driven by business growth initiatives, partially offset by a higher contribution from investment results.
revenues, benefits and expenses
2017 to 2016 annual comparison. revenues decreased $381 million. excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, as discussed above, revenues increased $152 million. net investment income increased $126 million primarily reflecting higher average invested assets resulting from continued business growth and higher investment income from unaffiliated reserve financing activity, which resulted in a corresponding increase in interest expense, as discussed below, and higher income on non-coupon investments, partially offset by lower prepayment fee income. premiums increased $35 million primarily driven by growth in our term life insurance business. policy charges and fee income, asset management and service fees and other income decreased $9 million, reflecting higher cost of reinsurance premiums, as a result of the unfavorable ongoing impact of the second quarter 2017 change in the method of accounting for reinsurance (partial offsets included in benefits and expenses below), partially offset by an increase in asset management and service fees and other income from continued business growth.
76
benefits and expenses decreased $111 million. excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, as discussed above, benefits and expenses increased $189 million. general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, increased $66 million primarily reflecting higher operating expenses including business growth initiatives. interest expense increased $65 million related to higher reserve financing costs, as discussed above. policyholders' benefits and interest credited to account balances increased $58 million, reflecting continued business growth and an unfavorable impact from mortality experience, partially offset by the favorable ongoing impact of the second quarter 2017 change in the method of accounting for reinsurance, as discussed above.
2016 to 2015 annual comparison. revenues increased $122 million. excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, as discussed above, revenues increased $199 million. net investment income increased $153 million primarily reflecting higher invested assets resulting from continued business growth and higher required capital, higher prepayment fee income and higher income on non-coupon investments. policy charges and fee income, asset management and service fees and other income increased $82 million, primarily driven by growth in universal life business, partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of unearned revenue reserves, driven by the impact of changes in the estimated profitability of the business due to experience relative to our assumptions. partially offsetting these increases was a $36 million decrease in premiums, primarily driven by higher ceded reinsurance premiums which were mostly offset by reserve changes in policyholders' benefits.
benefits and expenses increased $678 million. excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, as discussed above, benefits and expenses increased $267 million. policyholders' benefits and interest credited to account balances increased $195 million primarily reflecting universal life business growth and less favorable mortality experience, partially offset by reserve changes for ceded reinsurance premiums discussed above. general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, increased $40 million primarily driven by business growth and initiatives. interest expense increased $33 million related to higher reserve financing costs.

(1)   single pay life premiums and excess (unscheduled) premiums are included in annualized new business premiums based on a 10% credit and represented approximately 15%, 13% and 17% of guaranteed universal life and 1%, 3% and 7% of other universal life annualized new business premiums for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
2017 to 2016 annual comparison. annualized new business premiums decreased $6 million, primarily driven by lower guaranteed universal life sales, partially offset by higher sales across other products, as a result of certain distribution and product actions implemented to enhance product mix diversification.
2016 to 2015 annual comparison. annualized new business premiums increased $39 million, primarily driven by the continued impact of product enhancements in both universal and variable life as well as continued improvements in distribution execution.

(1)   certain of our retirement segment's non-u.s. dollar-denominated earnings are from longevity reinsurance contracts, which are denominated in british pounds sterling, and are therefore subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. effective january 1, 2016, the financial results of our retirement segment include the impact of an intercompany arrangement with our corporate and other operations designed to mitigate the impact of exchange rate changes on the segment's u.s. dollar-equivalent earnings. for more information related to this intercompany arrangement, see "-results of operations-impact of foreign currency exchange rates," above.
adjusted operating income
2017 to 2016 annual comparison. adjusted operating income increased $232 million. results for 2017 and 2016 reflected a net charge of $20 million and a net benefit of $6 million, respectively, from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. excluding this unfavorable comparative impact, adjusted operating income increased $258 million, primarily driven by higher net investment spread results, a higher contribution from reserve experience and higher fee income. the increase in net investment spread results primarily reflected higher income on non-coupon investments, higher invested assets and net prepayment fee income, partially offset by lower reinvestment rates net of crediting rate actions on full service general account stable value products. the higher contribution from reserve experience primarily reflected higher mortality gains on a comparative basis for existing contracts and growth in our pension risk transfer business. higher fee income primarily reflected growth in full service average account values driven by market appreciation.
2016 to 2015 annual comparison. adjusted operating income increased $81 million. results for 2016 reflected a net benefit of $6 million from our annual review and update of assumptions and other refinements, driven by favorable updates to actuarial assumptions, while results for 2015 reflected no net impact from our annual review and update of assumptions. excluding this favorable comparative impact, adjusted operating income increased $74 million, primarily driven by higher net investment spread results, partially offset by a lower contribution from reserve experience, higher general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, and lower fee income. the increase in net investment spread results primarily reflected higher net prepayment fee income, higher invested assets and income on non-coupon investments, partially offset by lower reinvestment rates net of crediting rate reductions on full service general account stable value products. the lower contribution from reserve experience primarily reflected lower mortality gains on a comparative basis for pension risk transfer contracts. the increase in general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, was primarily driven by increased legal costs. the decrease in fee income primarily reflected lower margins on full service account values. this decrease was partially offset by growth in average account values and an increase in per participant fee charges.
revenues, benefits and expenses
2017 to 2016 annual comparison. revenues increased $967 million. premiums increased $699 million, primarily driven by new pension risk transfer transactions. this increase in premiums resulted in a corresponding increase in policyholders' benefits, as discussed below. net investment income increased $219 million, primarily reflecting higher income on non-coupon investments and higher invested assets, partially offset by lower reinvestment rates. policy charges and fee income, asset management and service fees and other income increased $49 million, primarily driven by higher fee income from growth in full service average account values driven by market appreciation.
benefits and expenses increased $735 million. excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, as discussed above, benefits and expenses increased $709 million. policyholders' benefits, including the change in policy reserves, increased $705 million, primarily related to the increase in premiums discussed above.
78
2016 to 2015 annual comparison. revenues increased $1,055 million. premiums increased $851 million primarily driven by pension risk transfer transactions. this increase in premiums resulted in a corresponding increase in policyholders' benefits, as discussed in benefits and expenses below. net investment income increased $181 million, primarily reflecting higher invested assets, higher prepayment fee income and income on non-coupon investments, partially offset by lower reinvestment rates.
benefits and expenses increased $974 million. excluding the impact of our annual review and update of assumptions, as discussed above, benefits and expenses increased $981 million. policyholders' benefits, including the change in policy reserves, increased $968 million, primarily related to the increase in premiums discussed above. interest credited to policyholders' account balances increased $32 million, primarily driven by higher prepayment fee income credited to experience rated account balances and growth in account values as discussed below, partially offset by the impact of crediting rate reductions on full service general account stable value account values.
account values account values are a significant driver of our operating results, and are primarily driven by net additions (withdrawals) and the impact of market changes. the income we earn on most of our fee-based products varies in part with the level of fee-based account values, since many policy fees are determined by these values. the investment income and interest we credit to policyholders on our spread-based products varies with the level of general account values. to a lesser extent, changes in account values impact our pattern of amortization of dac and voba and general and administrative expenses. the following table shows the changes in the account values and net additions (withdrawals) of retirement segment products for the periods indicated. net additions (withdrawals) are plan sales and participant deposits or additions, as applicable, minus plan and participant withdrawals and benefits. account values include both internally- and externally-managed client balances as the total balances drive revenue for the retirement segment. for more information on internally-managed balances, see "-investment management."

(1)   additions primarily include: group annuities calculated based on premiums received; longevity reinsurance contracts calculated as the present value of future projected benefits; and investment-only stable value contracts calculated as the fair value of customers' funds held in a client-owned trust.
(2)   "other" activity includes the effect of foreign exchange rate changes associated with our u.k. longevity reinsurance business and changes in asset balances for externally-managed accounts. for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, "other" activity also includes $4,782 million in receipts offset by $4,375 million in payments and $2,914 million in receipts offset by $2,364 million in payments, respectively, related to funding agreements backed by commercial paper which typically have maturities of less than 90 days.
2017 to 2016 annual comparison. the increase in full service account values primarily reflected the favorable changes in the market value of customer funds and the addition of a significant defined contribution transaction. the increase in net additions was primarily driven by higher large plan sales, partially offset by higher large plan lapses.
the increase in institutional investment products account values primarily reflected net additions from pension risk transfer transactions, interest credited on customer funds and the impact from foreign currency fluctuations on longevity reinsurance account values, partially offset by net withdrawals from investment-only stable value accounts. the increase in net additions was primarily driven by greater net additions related to pension risk transfer transactions, partially offset by investment-only stable value accounts, which reflected net withdrawals in 2017 compared to net additions in 2016.
79
2016 to 2015 annual comparison. the increase in full service account values primarily reflected the favorable changes in the market value of customer funds. the decrease in net additions was primarily driven by lower large plan sales. this decrease was partially offset by lower plan lapses, as well as net participant deposits in 2016 compared to net participant withdrawals in 2015.
the increase in institutional investment products account values primarily reflected net additions resulting from investment-only stable value accounts and pension risk transfer transactions. the increase in net additions was primarily driven by investment-only stable value accounts, which reflected net additions in 2016 compared to net withdrawals in 2015. this increase was partially offset by less net additions related to pension risk transfer transactions in 2016 as compared to 2015 and a bank-owned life insurance stable value transaction in 2015.

__________
(1)   ratio of policyholder benefits to earned premiums, policy charges and fee income.
(2)   benefits ratios reflect the impacts of our annual reviews and updates of assumptions and other refinements. excluding these impacts, the group life, group disability and total group insurance benefits ratios were 88.7%, 78.9% and 86.9% for 2017, respectively, 88.5%, 82.9% and 87.5% for 2016, respectively, and 89.2%, 79.2% and 87.5% for 2015, respectively.
(3)   ratio of general and administrative expenses (excluding commissions) to gross premiums plus policy charges and fee income.
adjusted operating income
2017 to 2016 annual comparison. adjusted operating income increased $33 million, including favorable comparative net impacts from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. results for 2017 included a $55 million net benefit from these updates while results for 2016 included a $41 million net benefit. the net benefit in both periods was primarily driven by favorable experience related to our group disability business. excluding the effect of these items, adjusted operating income increased $19 million, primarily reflecting favorable underwriting results in our group disability business and a higher contribution from net investment spread results, partially offset by higher expenses. the underwriting results in our group disability business reflect increased new business and favorable claim experience, while the underwriting results in our group life business remained relatively flat in comparison to the prior year period.
80
2016 to 2015 annual comparison. adjusted operating income increased $44 million, primarily reflecting favorable comparative net impacts from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. results for 2016 included a $41 million net benefit from these updates, while results for 2015 included a $28 million net benefit. excluding the effect of these items, adjusted operating income increased $30 million primarily reflecting more favorable underwriting results in our group life business, a higher contribution from net investment spread results, and lower expenses, partially offset by less favorable underwriting results in our group disability business. the underwriting results in our group life business reflected a favorable impact from a reserve refinement and more favorable experience, while the underwriting results in our group disability business reflected the impact of lower claim resolutions on long-term contracts and higher benefits resulting from other claims-related charges, partially offset by the impacts of fewer new claims and increased new business.
revenues, benefits and expenses
2017 to 2016 annual comparison. revenues increased $128 million. excluding an unfavorable comparative impact of $37 million resulting from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, revenues increased $165 million. the increase reflected $135 million of higher premiums and policy charges and fee income, primarily driven by the increase in new business in both our group life and group disability businesses, as well as higher premiums on experience-rated contracts in our group life business with corresponding offsets in benefits and expenses. net investment income increased $29 million primarily driven by higher income from non-coupon investments.
benefits and expenses increased $95 million. excluding a favorable comparative impact of $51 million resulting from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, benefits and expenses increased $146 million. this increase primarily reflected higher policyholders' benefits and changes in reserves, driven by higher benefits on group life experience-rated contracts, as discussed above, higher benefit payments in our group disability business and our non-experience rated group life contracts, and higher general and administrative expenses.
2016 to 2015 annual comparison. revenues increased $200 million. excluding a favorable comparative impact of $42 million resulting from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, revenues increased $158 million. the increase reflected $140 million of higher premiums and policy charges and fee income primarily driven by the increase in new business in both our group life and group disability businesses, as well as higher premiums on existing experience-rated contracts in our group life business. net investment income increased $21 million driven by higher prepayment income and income from non-coupon investments.
benefits and expenses increased $156 million. excluding an unfavorable comparative impact of $29 million resulting from our annual review and update of assumptions and other refinements, benefits and expenses increased $127 million. policyholders' benefits, including the change in reserves, increased $120 million, driven by the impact of new business for both our group life and group disability businesses, the impact of lower claim resolutions on long-term contracts in our group disability business, and higher benefits on existing experience-rated contracts in our group life business, partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses.

2017 to 2016 annual comparison. total annualized new business premiums increased $5 million primarily driven by sales to new clients in our group disability business, partially offset by lower sales in our group life business, which included a large client sale in 2016.

2016 to 2015 annual comparison. total annualized new business premiums increased $162 million as we continued to grow through sales to new and existing clients in both our group disability business and our group life business, which included a large client sale in 2016, while maintaining pricing and underwriting discipline.

(1)   certain of our investment management segment's investment activities are based in currencies other than the u.s. dollar and are therefore subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. effective january 1, 2016, the financial results of our investment management segment include the impact of an intercompany arrangement with our corporate and other operations designed to mitigate the impact of exchange rate changes on the segment's u.s. dollar-equivalent earnings. for more information related to this intercompany arrangement, see "-results of operations-impact of foreign currency exchange rates," above.
adjusted operating income
2017 to 2016 annual comparison. adjusted operating income increased $192 million. the increase primarily reflected higher asset management fees, net of related expenses, driven by an increase in average assets under management as a result of net fixed income inflows, market appreciation, and a favorable fee rate modification within certain real estate funds that occurred in the third quarter of 2016. also contributing to the increase were higher other related revenues, net of associated expenses, driven by higher strategic investing results due to favorable investment performance, higher net performance-based incentive fees, and an increase in commercial mortgage agency loan originations. these increases were partially offset by higher expenses.
2016 to 2015 annual comparison. adjusted operating income increased $8 million. the increase primarily reflected higher asset management fees, net of related expenses, driven by an increase in average fixed income assets under management as a result of net inflows, market appreciation, and a favorable fee rate modification within certain real estate funds that occurred in the third quarter of 2016, partially offset by a decline in average equity assets under management as a result of net outflows and market volatility experienced in the first half of 2016. the increase was also partially offset by lower other related revenues, net of associated expenses, primarily related to lower strategic investing results and lower equity fund-related incentive fees, net of expenses.

2017 to 2016 annual comparison. revenues increased $394 million. total asset management fees increased $190 million primarily as a result of net inflows within fixed income, market appreciation, and the impact of a favorable fee rate modification within certain real estate funds. other related revenues increased $184 million primarily due to an increase in gross performance-based incentive fees related to certain fixed income funds, higher strategic investing results driven by favorable investment performance, and an increase in commercial mortgage agency loan originations. service, distribution and other revenues increased $20 million reflecting higher net investment income and other revenue related to certain consolidated funds.
expenses increased $202 million, primarily reflecting higher compensation attributable to higher earnings, as well as an increase in non-compensation related expenses.
2016 to 2015 annual comparison. revenues increased $17 million. total asset management fees increased $92 million, primarily as a result of net inflows and market appreciation within fixed income as well as from a favorable fee rate modification within certain real estate funds that occurred in the third quarter of 2016. other related revenues increased $14 million, primarily due to higher performance-based incentive fees related to certain fixed income hedge funds. partially offsetting these increases was an $89 million decrease in service, distribution and other revenues reflecting lower service and other fees as well as the deconsolidation of certain collateralized loan obligations.
expenses increased $9 million, as a result of business growth, higher compensation related to favorable fixed income results and higher performance-based incentive fees (included in noncontrolling interest), partially offset by the deconsolidation of certain funds, as discussed above.

adjusted operating income
2017 to 2016 annual comparison. adjusted operating income from our life planner operations decreased $46 million including a net unfavorable impact of $32 million from currency fluctuations, inclusive of the currency hedging program discussed above. both periods also include the impact of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, which resulted in a $67 million net charge in 2017, including impacts from unfavorable economic assumption updates driven by a lower long-term interest rate assumption in japan, compared to a $38 million net charge in 2016.
excluding the effect of these items, adjusted operating income increased $15 million, primarily reflecting the growth of business in force in our japan and brazil operations, improved policyholder experience, and a higher contribution from net investment results, primarily from higher income on non-coupon investments and higher net prepayment fee income, partially offset by lower reinvestment rates. these favorable impacts were partially offset by higher expenses, including legal costs and expenses supporting business growth.

excluding the effect of these items, adjusted operating income increased $78 million, primarily reflecting the growth of business in force and continued strong persistency in japan, and a larger contribution from non-coupon investments. these favorable impacts were partially offset by higher expenses, including those supporting business growth, and less favorable comparative mortality experience.
adjusted operating income from our gibraltar life and other operations decreased $63 million including a net unfavorable impact of $169 million from currency fluctuations, inclusive of the currency hedging program discussed above. both periods included the impact of our annual reviews and updates of assumptions and other refinements which resulted in a $34 million net charge in 2016, including unfavorable economic assumption updates driven by lower interest rates in japan, compared to a $10 million net charge in 2015.

(1)   the amount for the year ended december 31, 2016 has been revised to correct the previously reported amount.
the amount of annualized new business premiums and the sales mix in terms of types and currency denomination of products for any given period can be significantly impacted by several factors, including but not limited to: the addition of new products, discontinuation of existing products, changes in credited interest rates for certain products and other product modifications, changes in premium rates, changes in interest rates or fluctuations in currency markets (as described below), changes in tax laws, changes in life insurance regulations or changes in the competitive environment. sales volume may increase or decrease prior to certain of these changes becoming effective, and then fluctuate in the other direction following such changes.
our diverse product portfolio in japan, in terms of currency mix and premium payment structure, allows us to adapt to changing market and competitive dynamics, including the extremely low interest rate environment. we regularly examine our product offerings and their related profitability and, as a result, we have repriced or discontinued sales of certain products that do not meet our profit expectations. the impact of these actions, coupled with the introduction of certain new products, has generally resulted in an increase in sales of products denominated in u.s. dollars relative to products denominated in other currencies.

annualized new business premiums, on a constant exchange rate basis, from our life planner operations increased $111 million. growth in life planner headcount in our japan operation resulted in an increase in u.s. dollar-denominated whole life and retirement products and yen-denominated term life and retirement products. the increase also reflected higher sales in our brazil operations across various product lines as life planner count continued to grow.
annualized new business premiums, on a constant exchange rate basis, from our gibraltar life operations decreased $105 million. life consultant sales increased $8 million primarily from higher sales of u.s. dollar-denominated whole life products resulting from the introduction of a new recurring pay life product in the second quarter of 2017. this increase was partially offset by lower sales of yen-denominated whole life and term life products. bank channel sales decreased $102 million primarily from lower sales of yen-denominated term life and whole life products following the premium rate increases on yen-based products in april of 2017, the suspension of sales of yen-denominated annuity products in april 2016 in response to the low interest rate environment and lower sales of u.s. dollar- and australian dollar-denominated annuity products due to increased competition and product actions. this decrease was partially offset by higher sales of u.s. dollar-denominated whole life products. independent agency sales decreased $11 million primarily reflecting lower sales of yen-denominated whole life and term life products after the april 2017 repricing and lower sales of australian dollar-denominated annuity products. the decrease was partially offset by higher sales of u.s. dollar-denominated whole life products.

2017 to 2016 annual comparison. the loss from corporate and other operations, on an adjusted operating income basis, decreased $144 million. results for investment income, net of operating debt interest expense, improved $95 million, primarily reflecting lower operating debt interest expense, including efforts in 2016 to reduce leverage through senior debt maturities and early extinguishment of debt, and higher investment income, driven by the absence of a non-coupon investment loss incurred in the prior year and higher income on highly liquid assets. net charges from other corporate activities decreased $14 million, reflecting the absence of costs incurred in the prior year associated with the early extinguishment of certain debt, partially offset by increases in other corporate expenses, including higher costs for employee compensation plans tied to equity market and company performance, and increased expenses related to corporate initiatives. capital debt interest expense increased $19 million, primarily resulting from a junior subordinated debt issuance in the third quarter of 2017.
income from pension and employee benefits increased $54 million, primarily reflecting higher income from our qualified pension plan, including higher expected earnings on plan assets and lower interest costs on plan obligations driven by a decline in interest rates in 2016.
for purposes of calculating pension income from our qualified pension plan for the year ended december 31, 2018, we will decrease the discount rate from 4.15% to 3.65% as of december 31, 2017. the expected rate of return on plan assets and the assumed rate of increase in compensation will remain unchanged at 6.25% and 4.50%, respectively. giving effect to the foregoing assumptions and other factors, we expect income from our qualified pension plan in 2018 to be approximately $45 million to $50 million higher than 2017 levels. the increase is driven by higher expected returns on plan assets due to higher than expected plan fixed income asset growth in 2017 as well as lower interest costs on the plan obligation due to the lower discount rate.
for purposes of calculating postretirement benefit expenses for the year ended december 31, 2018, we will decrease the discount rate from 4.05% to 3.60% as of december 31, 2017. the expected rate of return on plan assets will remain unchanged at 7.00%. giving effect to the foregoing assumptions and other factors, we expect postretirement benefit expenses in 2018 to be approximately $30 million to $40 million lower than 2017 levels. the decrease in expenses is driven by favorable census updates at december 31, 2017, and higher expected returns on plan assets due to higher than expected asset growth in 2017.
in 2018, pension and other postretirement benefit service costs related to active employees will continue to be allocated to our business segments. for further information regarding our pension and postretirement plans, see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.
2016 to 2015 annual comparison. the loss from corporate and other operations, on an adjusted operating income basis, increased $268 million. net charges from other corporate activities increased $175 million, primarily reflecting higher costs for employee compensation plans tied to company stock and equity market returns, increased costs for enhanced regulatory supervision, costs associated with the early extinguishment of certain debt, higher legal costs, the absence of a favorable impact from escheatment related matters in the prior year and increased costs related to other corporate initiatives. the increased charges were partially offset by the absence of certain remediation costs incurred in the prior year. results for investment income, net of operating debt interest expense, decreased $68 million, primarily reflecting lower levels of invested assets resulting from assets transferred to other business segments and lower net investment income from non-coupon investments. this decrease was partially offset by lower operating debt interest expense resulting from efforts to reduce leverage through senior debt maturities in late 2015 and early 2016, and the early extinguishment of certain debt in the second quarter of 2016. capital debt interest expense decreased $45 million, primarily reflecting the reassignment of capital debt to operating debt and efforts to reduce leverage.
income from pension and employee benefits decreased $70 million, primarily reflecting lower income from our qualified pension plan, driven by lower expected returns on plan assets due to lower than expected plan fixed income asset growth in 2015, as well as higher interest costs on the plan obligation due to a higher discount rate.
capital protection framework
92
"realized investment gains (losses), net and related adjustments," which are excluded from adjusted operating income, included net losses of $154 million, $1,649 million and $673 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to our capital protection framework. the comparative variance between 2017 and the prior years is primarily attributed to changes in our individual annuities risk management strategy implemented in 2016, whereby we terminated the existing intercompany derivative transactions between corporate and other operations and the individual annuities business segment related to managing interest rate risk and we now manage this risk within the individual annuities business segment. the net losses in 2016 and 2015, while the intercompany derivative transactions between corporate and other operations and the individual annuities business segment were in place, primarily resulted from our utilization of capital management strategies to manage a portion of our interest rate risk, and reflect changes in interest rates with respect to the exposures outstanding during the respective periods. for more information on our individual annuities risk management strategy, see "-individual annuities." for more information on our capital protection framework, see "-liquidity and capital resources-capital protection framework."
divested businesses divested businesses included in corporate and other our income includes results from several businesses that have been or will be sold or exited, including businesses that have been placed in wind down status that do not qualify for "discontinued operations" accounting treatment under u.s. gaap. the results of these divested businesses are reflected in our corporate and other operations, but are excluded from adjusted operating income. a summary of the results of the divested businesses reflected in our corporate and other operations is as follows for the periods indicated:

long-term care. results for the year ended december 31, 2017 increased compared to 2016 primarily reflecting net realized investment gains in 2017 compared to net realized investment losses in 2016, driven by a favorable comparative change in the market value of derivatives used in duration management, and higher net investment income. these increases were partially offset by unfavorable policy experience. results for the year ended december 31, 2016 decreased compared to 2015 primarily reflecting an increase in net realized investment losses, driven by the unfavorable comparative change in the market value of derivatives used in duration management. this decrease was partially offset by favorable policy experience and higher net investment income.
closed block division the closed block division includes certain in force traditional domestic participating life insurance and annuity products and assets that are used for the payment of benefits and policyholder dividends on these policies (collectively, the "closed block"), as well as certain related assets and liabilities. we no longer offer these traditional domestic participating policies. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.
each year, the board of directors of prudential insurance determines the dividends payable on participating policies for the following year based on the experience of the closed block, including investment income, net realized and unrealized investment gains, mortality experience and other factors. although closed block experience for dividend action decisions is based upon statutory results, at the time the closed block was established, we developed, as required by u.s. gaap, an actuarial calculation of the timing of the maximum future earnings from the policies included in the closed block. if actual cumulative earnings in any given period are greater than the cumulative earnings we expected, we record this excess as a policyholder dividend obligation. we will subsequently pay this excess to closed block policyholders as an additional dividend unless it is otherwise offset by future closed block performance that is less favorable than we originally expected. the policyholder dividends we charge to expense within the closed block division will include any change in our policyholder dividend obligation that we recognize for the excess of actual cumulative earnings in any given period over the cumulative earnings we expected in addition to the actual policyholder dividends declared by the board of directors of prudential insurance.
93
as of december 31, 2017, the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was $1,790 million, which was recorded as a policyholder dividend obligation. actual cumulative earnings, as required by u.s. gaap, reflect the recognition of realized investment gains and losses in the current period, as well as changes in assets and related liabilities that support the closed block policies. additionally, the accumulation of net unrealized investment gains that have arisen subsequent to the establishment of the closed block have been reflected as a policyholder dividend obligation of $3,656 million at december 31, 2017, to be paid to closed block policyholders unless offset by future experience, with a corresponding amount reported in aoci.

income (loss) before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures
2017 to 2016 annual comparison. income (loss) before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures increased $177 million. results for 2017 primarily reflected a $175 million increase in net realized investment gains and related activity, primarily due to higher gains from sales of equity securities and fixed maturities, partially offset by unfavorable changes in the value of derivatives used in risk management activities. net insurance activity results increased $92 million, primarily as a result of a decrease in the 2018 dividend scale, partially offset by the runoff of policies in force and higher benefit payments. net investment income increased $75 million, primarily driven by higher income on non-coupon investments and higher prepayment income, partially offset by lower reinvestment rates. as a result of the above and other variances, a $143 million increase in the policyholder dividend obligation was recorded in 2017, compared to $48 million reduction in 2016. if actual cumulative earnings fall below expected cumulative earnings in future periods, earnings volatility in the closed block division, which is primarily due to changes in investment results, may not be offset by changes in the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation. for a discussion of closed block division realized investment gains (losses), net, see "-realized investment gains and losses."
2016 to 2015 annual comparison. income (loss) before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures decreased $190 million. results for 2016 primarily reflected a $399 million decrease in net realized investment gains, primarily due to lower gains on equity securities, lower gains from sales of fixed maturities and less favorable changes in the value of derivatives used in risk management activities. net investment income decreased $75 million, primarily due to lower returns on non-coupon investments and lower reinvestment rates, partially offset by higher prepayment fee income. net insurance activity results increased $35 million, primarily due to lower benefit payments. as a result of the above and other variances, a $48 million reduction in the policyholder dividend obligation was recorded in 2016, compared to a $137 million increase in 2015.
revenues, benefits and expenses
2017 to 2016 annual comparison. revenues increased $157 million, primarily due to increases of $100 million in net realized investment gains, $75 million in other revenue and $75 million in net investment income, as discussed above. partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in premiums of $94 million, primarily due to run off of policies in force.
benefits and expenses decreased $20 million. policyholders' benefits, including changes in reserves, decreased $63 million primarily due to the runoff of policies in force, as discussed above. partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in dividends to policyholders of $66 million, reflecting an increase in the policyholder dividend obligation expense due to changes in cumulative earnings.
2016 to 2015 annual comparison. revenues decreased $491 million, primarily due to a $399 million decrease in net realized investment gains and a $75 million decrease in net investment income, as discussed above.
benefits and expenses decreased $301 million, primarily due to a $189 million decrease in dividends to policyholders, reflecting a decrease in the policyholder dividend obligation expense due to changes in cumulative earnings. in addition, policyholders' benefits, including changes in reserves, decreased $83 million, primarily due to the runoff of policies in force.

effective tax rate                                                                (22.2   )%             23.4    %             26.7    %
effective tax rate the effective tax rate is the ratio of "total income tax expense (benefit)" divided by "income before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures." our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 was (22.2)%, 23.4% and 26.7%, respectively. for a detailed description of the nature of each significant reconciling item, see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. the decrease in the effective tax rate from 26.7% in 2015 to 23.4% in 2016 was primarily driven by a decrease in pre-tax net income. the decrease in the effective tax rate from 23.4% in 2016 to (22.2)% in 2017 was primarily driven by the impacts of the tax act of 2017 on the date of enactment. going forward, we generally expect a lower future effective tax rate than we have reported in recent years. this reduction is primarily due to applying the lower corporate tax rate under the tax act of 2017 to our u.s. businesses' earnings.
unrecognized tax benefits the company's liability for income taxes includes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and interest that relate to tax years still subject to review by the irs or other taxing authorities. the completion of review or the expiration of the federal statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the liability for income taxes. the total unrecognized benefit as of december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $45 million, $26 million and $6 million, respectively. we do not anticipate any significant changes within the next twelve months to our total unrecognized tax benefits related to tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired.
income tax expense vs. income tax paid in cash income tax expense recorded under u.s. gaap routinely differs from the income taxes paid in cash in any given year. income tax expense recorded under u.s. gaap is based on income reported in our consolidated statements of operations for the current period and it includes both current and deferred taxes. income taxes paid during the year include tax installments made for the current year as well as tax payments and refunds related to prior periods.

experience-rated contractholder liabilities, trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and other related investments certain products included in the retirement and international insurance segments are experience-rated in that investment results associated with these products are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. the majority of investments supporting these experience-rated products are classified as trading and are carried at fair value. these trading investments are reflected on the consolidated statements of financial position as "trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities, at fair value" ("taasil"). realized and unrealized gains (losses) for these investments are reported in "other income." interest and dividend income for these investments is reported in "net investment income." to a lesser extent, these experience-rated products
95
are also supported by derivatives and commercial mortgage and other loans. the derivatives that support these experience-rated products are reflected on the consolidated statements of financial position as "other long-term investments" and are carried at fair value, and the realized and unrealized gains (losses) are reported in "realized investment gains (losses), net." the commercial mortgage and other loans that support these experience-rated products are carried at unpaid principal, net of unamortized discounts and an allowance for losses, and are reflected on the consolidated statements of financial position as "commercial mortgage and other loans." gains (losses) on sales and changes in the valuation allowance for commercial mortgage and other loans are reported in "realized investment gains (losses), net."
our retirement segment has two types of experience-rated products that are supported by taasil and other related investments. fully participating products are those for which the entire return on underlying investments is passed back to the policyholders through a corresponding adjustment to the related liability, primarily classified in the consolidated statements of financial position as "policyholders' account balances." the adjustment to the liability is based on changes in the fair value of all of the related assets, including commercial mortgage and other loans, which are carried at amortized cost, less any valuation allowance. partially participating products are those for which only a portion of the return on underlying investments is passed back to the policyholders over time through changes to the contractual crediting rates. the crediting rates are typically reset semiannually, often subject to a minimum crediting rate, and returns are required to be passed back within ten years.
in our international insurance segment, the experience-rated products are fully participating. as a result, the entire return on the underlying investments is passed back to policyholders through a corresponding adjustment to the related liability.
adjusted operating income excludes net investment gains (losses) on taasil, related derivatives and commercial mortgage and other loans. this is consistent with the exclusion of realized investment gains (losses) with respect to other investments supporting insurance liabilities managed on a consistent basis. in addition, to be consistent with the historical treatment of charges related to realized investment gains (losses) on investments, adjusted operating income also excludes the change in contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes in the pool of investments (including changes in the fair value of commercial mortgage and other loans) supporting these experience-rated contracts, which are reflected in "interest credited to policyholders' account balances." the result of this approach is that adjusted operating income for these products includes net fee revenue and interest spread we earn on these experience-rated contracts, and excludes changes in fair value of the pool of investments, both realized and unrealized, that we expect will ultimately accrue to the contractholders.
the following table sets forth the impact on results for the periods indicated of these items that are excluded from adjusted operating income:

__________
(1)   decreases to contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes are limited by certain floors and therefore do not reflect cumulative declines in recorded asset values of $18 million, $10 million and $15 million as of december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we have recovered and expect to recover in future periods these declines in recorded asset values through subsequent increases in recorded asset values or reductions in crediting rates on contractholder liabilities.
(2)   included in the amounts above related to the change in the liability to contractholders as a result of commercial mortgage and other loans are a decrease of $21 million, an increase of $4 million and a decrease of $64 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. as prescribed by u.s. gaap, changes in the fair value of commercial mortgage and other loans held for investment in our general account, other than when associated with impairments, are not recognized in income in the current period, while the impact of these changes in fair value are reflected as a change in the liability to fully participating contractholders in the current period.
the net impacts for the retirement segment of changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities and investment gains (losses) on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and other related investments reflect timing differences between the recognition of the mark-to-market adjustments and the recognition of the recovery of these adjustments in future periods through subsequent increases in asset values or reductions in crediting rates on contractholder liabilities for partially participating products. these impacts also reflect the difference between the fair value of the underlying commercial mortgage and other loans and the amortized cost, less any valuation allowance, of these loans, as described above.
valuation of assets and liabilities fair value of assets and liabilities the authoritative guidance related to fair value measurement establishes a framework that includes a three-level hierarchy used to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value. the level in the hierarchy within which the fair value falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement. the fair values of assets and liabilities classified as level 3 include at least one significant unobservable input in the measurement. see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for an additional description of the valuation hierarchy levels as well as for the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by hierarchy level presented on a consolidated basis.
the table below presents the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as of the periods indicated, and the portion of such assets and liabilities that are classified in level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. the table also provides details about these assets and liabilities excluding those held in the closed block division. we believe the amounts excluding the closed block division are most relevant to an understanding of our operations that are pertinent to investors in prudential financial because substantially all closed block division assets support obligations and liabilities relating to the closed block policies only. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the closed block.

(1)   the amount of level 3 assets taken as a percentage of total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis for pfi excluding the closed block division and for the closed block division totaled 1.9% and 4.9%, respectively, as of december 31, 2017 and 1.5% and 3.3% as of december 31, 2016.
(2)   "all other" and "other liabilities" primarily include derivatives. the amounts classified as level 3 exclude the impact of netting.
(3)   prior period amounts are presented on a basis consistent with the current period presentation, reflecting the adoption of asu 2015-07.
the determination of fair value, which for certain assets and liabilities is dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, can have a significant impact on our results of operations and may require the application of a greater degree of judgment depending on market conditions, as the ability to value assets and liabilities can be significantly impacted by a decrease in market activity or a lack of transactions executed in an orderly manner. the following sections provide information regarding certain assets and liabilities which are valued using level 3 inputs and could have a significant impact on our results of operations.
fixed maturity and equity securities fixed maturity securities included in level 3 in our fair value hierarchy are generally priced based on internally-developed valuations, indicative broker quotes or third-party pricing services, where management believes valuations are based on unobservable inputs. for certain private fixed maturity and equity securities, the internally-developed valuation model uses significant unobservable inputs and, accordingly, such securities are included in level 3 in our fair value hierarchy. level 3 fixed maturity securities for pfi excluding the closed block division included approximately $6.5 billion of public fixed maturities as of december 31, 2017 with values primarily based on indicative broker quotes, and approximately $2.6 billion of private fixed maturities, with values primarily based on internally-developed models or third-party pricing services. significant unobservable inputs used included: issue specific spread adjustments, material non-public financial information, management judgment, estimation of future earnings and cash flows, default rate assumptions, liquidity assumptions and indicative quotes from market makers. these inputs are usually considered unobservable, as not all market participants have access to this data.
98
the impact our determination of fair value for fixed maturity and equity securities has on our results of operations is dependent on our classification of the security as either trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity. for investments classified as trading, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded within "other income." for investments classified as available-for-sale, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in aoci, a separate component of equity. investments classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost.
separate account assets separate account assets included in level 3 primarily include corporate securities and commercial mortgage loans. the valuation of corporate securities is determined as described above for fixed maturity and equity securities. see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the valuation of commercial mortgage loans. separate account liabilities are reported at contract value and not at fair value.
variable annuity living benefit features future policy benefits classified in level 3 primarily include liabilities related to guarantees associated with the living benefit features of certain variable annuity contracts offered by our individual annuities segment, including gmab, gmwb and gmiwb. these benefits are accounted for as embedded derivatives and carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in "realized investment gains (losses), net." the fair values of the gmab, gmwb and gmiwb liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefit payments to customers less the present value of future rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature. this methodology could result in either a liability or contra-liability balance, based on capital market conditions and various policyholder behavior assumptions. since there is no observable active market for the transfer of these obligations, the valuations are calculated using internally-developed models with option pricing techniques. these models utilize significant assumptions that are primarily unobservable, including assumptions as to lapse rates, npr, utilization rates, withdrawal rates, mortality rates and equity market volatility. future policy benefits classified as level 3 for pfi excluding the closed block division were a net liability of $8.7 billion as of december 31, 2017. for additional information, see "-results of operations by segment-u.s. individual solutions division-individual annuities."
notes issued by consolidated vies as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, notes issued by consolidated vies represent notes issued by certain asset-backed investment vehicles, primarily collateralized loan obligations, which we are required to consolidate. the creditors of these vies do not have recourse to the company in excess of the assets contained within the vies. we have elected the fair value option for the majority of these notes, and have based the fair value on the corresponding bank loan collateral.
for additional information about the key estimates and assumptions used in our determination of fair value, see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
realized investment gains and losses realized investment gains and losses are generated from numerous sources, including the following significant items:
â€¢   sale of investments;
â€¢   maturities of foreign-denominated investments;
â€¢   adjustments to the cost basis of investments for otti;
â€¢   recognition of otti in earnings for foreign-denominated securities that are approaching maturity and are in an unrealized loss position due to foreign currency exchange rate movements;
â€¢   net changes in the allowance for losses, certain restructurings and foreclosures on commercial mortgage and other loans; and
â€¢   fair value changes on embedded derivatives and free-standing derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
the level of otti generally reflects economic conditions and is expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and to decrease when economic conditions improve. historically, the causes of otti have been specific to each individual issuer and have not directly resulted in impairments to other securities within the same industry or geographic region. we may also realize additional credit and interest rate-related losses through sales of investments pursuant to our credit risk and portfolio management objectives. for additional information regarding otti policies for fixed maturity and equity securities, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
99
we use interest rate and currency derivatives to manage interest and currency exchange rate exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities, including duration mismatches. we also use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk that unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates will materially affect u.s. dollar-equivalent earnings generated by certain of our non-u.s. businesses. in addition, equity-based and interest rate derivatives hedge a portion of the risks embedded in certain variable annuity products with optional living benefit guarantees. many of these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting; and consequently, we recognize the changes in fair value of such contracts from period to period in current earnings, although the required accounting for associated assets and liabilities may or may not be similar.
accordingly, realized investment gains and losses from our derivative activities can contribute significantly to fluctuations in net income. for a further discussion of living benefit guarantees and related hedge positions in our individual annuities segment, see "-results of operations by segment-u.s. individual solutions division-individual annuities" above.
adjusted operating income generally excludes "realized investment gains (losses), net," subject to certain exceptions. these exceptions primarily include realized investment gains or losses within certain of our businesses for which such gains or losses are a principal source of earnings, gains or losses associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments and related charges and adjustments. otti, interest rate-related losses and credit-related losses on sales (other than those related to certain of our businesses which primarily originate investments for sale or syndication to unrelated investors) are excluded from adjusted operating income. additionally, adjusted operating income generally excludes realized investment gains and losses from products that contain embedded derivatives and from associated derivative portfolios that are part of an asset-liability management program related to the risk of those products. however, the effectiveness of the hedging program will ultimately be reflected in adjusted operating income over time. for additional details regarding adjusted operating income, see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.
effective january 1, 2016, the company classifies fixed maturity prepayment fees and call premiums in "net investment income" rather than "realized investments gains (losses), net." the impact of this change for the year ended december 31, 2015 was immaterial.

2017 to 2016 annual comparison net gains on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities were $585 million and $773 million for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily driven by sales and maturities of u.s. dollar-denominated securities within our international insurance segment. see below for additional information regarding otti of fixed maturity securities.
net realized gains on equity securities were $565 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, primarily driven by net gains on sales of $588 million including $546 million within our international insurance segment from portfolio reallocation, offset by otti of $23 million. net realized gains on equity securities were $127 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily driven by net gains on sales of $188 million, offset by otti of $61 million.
net realized gains on commercial mortgage and other loans for the year ended december 31, 2017 were $70 million, primarily driven by net gains on originated mortgage servicing rights of approximately $72 million in our investment management business. net realized gains on commercial mortgage and other loans for the year ended december 31, 2016 were $54 million, primarily driven by net gains on originated mortgage servicing rights of $53 million in our investment management business and a net decrease in the allowance for losses of $5 million. for additional information regarding our allowance for losses, see "-general account investments-commercial mortgage and other loans-commercial mortgage and other loans quality."
net realized losses on derivatives were $1,147 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to net realized gains of $1,013 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the net derivative losses for the year ended december 31, 2017 reflected losses of $869 million on product-related embedded derivatives and related hedges mainly associated with certain variable annuity contracts; losses of $481 million on foreign currency derivatives used to hedge foreign-denominated investments as the u.s. dollar weakened against various currencies; and losses of $350 million on equity derivatives in our capital hedge program as the equity indices increased. partially offsetting these losses were net gains of $370 million on interest rate derivatives used to manage duration as long-term rates declined; net gains of $26 million on currency derivatives primarily in japanese insurance operations used to hedge non-yen denominated investments as the yen strengthened against various currencies; and net gains of $152 million primarily representing the fees earned on fee-based synthetic gics, which are accounted for as derivatives. the net derivative gains for the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily reflected gains of $523 million on product-related embedded derivatives and related hedge positions mainly associated with certain variable annuity contracts; gains of $192 million on currency derivatives in japanese insurance operations used to hedge non-yen denominated investments as the yen strengthened against various currencies; gains of $172 million on currency derivatives in u.s. operations used to hedge foreign-denominated investments as the u.s. dollar strengthened against various currencies and gains of $157 million primarily representing the fees earned on fee-based gics, which are accounted for as derivatives.
related adjustments include the portions of "realized investment gains (losses), net" that are included in adjusted operating income and the portions of "other income" and "net investment income" that are excluded from adjusted operating income. these adjustments are made to arrive at "realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments" which are excluded from adjusted operating income. results for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 included net negative related adjustments of $500 million and $771 million, respectively. results for both periods were primarily driven by settlements on interest rate and currency derivatives.
charges that relate to "realized investment gains (losses), net" are also excluded from adjusted operating income and may be reflected as net charges or net benefits. results for the year ended december 31, 2017 included a net related benefit of $544 million, compared to a net related charge of $466 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. results for both periods were driven by the impact of derivative activity on the amortization of dac and other costs and certain policyholder reserves. results for the year ended december 31, 2016 were partially offset by a benefit of $515 million related to the implementation of the revised alm strategy in the individual annuities segment.
2016 to 2015 annual comparison net gains on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities were $773 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. excluding energy sector losses, net gains of $966 million were primarily from sales and maturities of u.s. dollar-denominated securities within our international insurance segment. the net gains for the year ended december 31, 2016 were partially offset by net trading losses of approximately $193 million on sales of securities within the energy sector. net gains on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities were $1,536 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily due to net gains of $1,363 million on sales and maturities of u.s. dollar-denominated securities within our international insurance segment. see below for additional information regarding the otti of fixed maturity securities for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015.

general account investments we maintain diversified investment portfolios in our general account to support our liabilities to customers as well as our other general liabilities. our general account does not include: (1) assets of our derivative operations; (2) assets of our investment management operations, including investments managed for third parties; and (3) those assets classified as "separate account assets" on our balance sheet.
the general account portfolios are managed pursuant to the distinct objectives and investment policy statements of pfi excluding the closed block division and the closed block division. the primary investment objectives of pfi excluding the closed block division include:
â€¢   hedging and otherwise managing the market risk characteristics of the major product liabilities and other obligations of the company;
â€¢   optimizing investment income yield within risk constraints over time; and
â€¢   for certain portfolios, optimizing total return, including both investment income yield and capital appreciation, within risk constraints over time, while managing the market risk exposures associated with the corresponding product liabilities.
we pursue our objective to optimize investment income yield for pfi excluding the closed block division over time through:
â€¢   the investment of net operating cash flows, including new product premium inflows, and proceeds from investment sales, repayments and prepayments into investments with attractive risk-adjusted yields; and
â€¢   the sale of lower-yielding investments, where appropriate, either to meet various cash flow needs or to manage the portfolio's risk exposure profile with respect to duration, credit, currency and other risk factors, while considering the impact on taxes and capital.
the primary investment objectives of the closed block division include:
â€¢   providing for the reasonable dividend expectations of the participating policyholders within the closed block division; and
â€¢   optimizing total return, including both investment income yield and capital appreciation, within risk constraints, while managing the market risk exposures associated with the major products in the closed block division.
our portfolio management approach, while emphasizing our investment income yield and asset/liability risk management objectives, also takes into account the capital and tax implications of portfolio activity and our assertions regarding our ability and intent to hold debt and equity securities to recovery. for a further discussion of our otti policies, including our assertions regarding our ability and intent to hold equity securities to recovery and any intention or requirement to sell debt securities before anticipated recovery, see "-fixed maturity securities-otti of fixed maturity securities" and "-equity securities-otti of equity securities" below.
management of investments the investment committee of our board of directors oversees our proprietary investments, including our general account portfolios, and regularly reviews performance and risk positions. our chief investment officer organization ("cio organization") develops investment policies subject to risk limits proposed by our enterprise risk management ("erm") group for the general account portfolios of our domestic and international insurance subsidiaries and directs and oversees management of the general account portfolios within risk limits and exposure ranges approved annually by the investment committee.
105
the cio organization, including related functions within our insurance subsidiaries, works closely with product actuaries and erm to understand the characteristics of our products and their associated market risk exposures. this information is incorporated into the development of target asset portfolios that manage market risk exposures associated with the liability characteristics and establish investment risk exposures, within tolerances prescribed by prudential's investment risk limits, on which we expect to earn an attractive risk-adjusted return. we develop asset strategies for specific classes of product liabilities and attributed or accumulated surplus, each with distinct risk characteristics. market risk exposures associated with the liabilities include interest rate risk, which is addressed through the duration characteristics of the target asset mix, and currency risk, which is addressed by the currency profile of the target asset mix. in certain of our smaller markets outside of the u.s. and japan, capital markets limitations hinder our ability to hedge interest rate exposure to the same extent we do for our u.s. and japan businesses and lead us to accept a higher degree of interest rate risk in these smaller portfolios. general account portfolios typically include allocations to credit and other investment risks as a means to enhance investment yields and returns over time.
most of our products can be categorized into the following three classes:
â€¢   interest-crediting products for which the rates credited to customers are periodically adjusted to reflect market and competitive forces and actual investment experience, such as fixed annuities and universal life insurance;
â€¢   participating individual and experience-rated group products in which customers participate in actual investment and business results through annual dividends, interest or return of premium; and
â€¢   products with fixed or guaranteed terms, such as traditional whole life and endowment products, guaranteed investment contracts, funding agreements and payout annuities.
our total investment portfolio is composed of a number of operating portfolios. each operating portfolio backs a specific set of liabilities, and the portfolios have a target asset mix that supports the liability characteristics, including duration, cash flow, liquidity needs and other criteria. as of december 31, 2017, the average duration of our domestic general account investment portfolios attributable to pfi excluding the closed block division, including the impact of derivatives, was between 7 and 8 years. as of december 31, 2017, the average duration of our international general account portfolios attributable to our japanese insurance operations, including the impact of derivatives, was between 11 and 12 years and represented a blend of yen-denominated and u.s. dollar and australian dollar-denominated investments, which have distinct average durations supporting the insurance liabilities we have issued in those currencies. our asset/liability management process has enabled us to manage our portfolios through several market cycles.
we implement our portfolio strategies primarily through investment in a broad range of fixed income assets, including government and agency securities, public and private corporate bonds and structured securities and commercial mortgage loans. in addition, we hold allocations of non-coupon investments, which include equity securities and other long-term investments such as joint ventures and limited partnerships, real estate held through direct ownership and seed money investments in separate accounts.
we manage our public fixed maturity portfolio to a risk profile directed or overseen by the cio organization and erm groups and to a profile that also reflects the market environments impacting both our domestic and international insurance portfolios. the return that we earn on the portfolio will be reflected in investment income and in realized gains or losses on investments.
we use privately-placed corporate debt securities and commercial mortgage loans, which consist of mortgages on diversified properties in terms of geography, property type and borrowers, to enhance the yield on our portfolio and to improve the overall diversification of the portfolios. private placements typically offer enhanced yields due to an illiquidity premium and generally offer enhanced credit protection in the form of covenants. our origination capability offers the opportunity to lead transactions and gives us the opportunity for better terms, including covenants and call protection, and to take advantage of innovative deal structures.
derivative strategies are employed in the context of our risk management framework to enhance our ability to manage interest rate and currency risk exposures of the asset portfolio relative to the liabilities and to manage credit and equity positions in the investment portfolios. for a discussion of our risk management process, see "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" below.
our portfolio asset allocation reflects our emphasis on diversification across asset classes, sectors and issuers. the cio organization, directly and through related functions within the insurance subsidiaries, implements portfolio strategies primarily through various investment management units within prudential's investment management segment. activities of the investment management segment on behalf of the general account portfolios are directed and overseen by the cio organization and monitored by erm for compliance with investment risk limits.
106
portfolio composition our investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans, policy loans and non-coupon investments as defined above. the composition of our general account reflects, within the discipline provided by our risk management approach, our need for competitive results and the selection of diverse investment alternatives available primarily through our investment management segment. the size of our portfolio enables us to invest in asset classes that may be unavailable to the typical investor.

the increase in general account investments attributable to pfi excluding the closed block division in 2017 was primarily due to the reinvestment of net investment income, a decrease in u.s. interest rates, credit spread tightening and the translation impact of the yen strengthening against the u.s. dollar. for information regarding the methodology used in determining the fair value of our fixed maturities, see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.

the increase in general account investments related to our japanese insurance operations in 2017 was primarily attributable to the reinvestment of net investment income, net business inflows and the translation impact of the yen strengthening against the u.s. dollar.
as of december 31, 2017, our japanese insurance operations had $62.6 billion, at carrying value, of investments denominated in u.s. dollars, including $5.8 billion that were hedged to yen through third-party derivative contracts and $43.8 billion that support liabilities denominated in u.s. dollars, with the remainder hedging our foreign currency exchange rate exposure on u.s. dollar-equivalent equity. as of december 31, 2016, our japanese insurance operations had $55.7 billion, at carrying value, of investments denominated in u.s. dollars, including $5.3 billion that were hedged to yen through third-party derivative contracts and $36.1 billion that support liabilities denominated in u.s. dollars, with the remainder hedging our foreign currency exchange rate exposure on u.s. dollar-equivalent equity. the $6.9 billion increase in the carrying value of u.s. dollar-denominated investments from december 31, 2016, was primarily attributable to portfolio growth as a result of net business inflows and the reinvestment of net investment income.
108
our japanese insurance operations had $11.4 billion and $11.0 billion, at carrying value, of investments denominated in australian dollars that support liabilities denominated in australian dollars, as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the $0.4 billion increase in the carrying value of australian dollar-denominated investments from december 31, 2016, was primarily attributable to the translation impact of the australian dollar strengthening against the u.s. dollar, portfolio growth as a result of net business inflows and the reinvestment of net investment income. for additional information regarding u.s. and australian dollar investments held in our japanese insurance operations and a discussion of our yen hedging strategy, see "-results of operations by segment-impact of foreign currency exchange rates" above.
investment results the following tables set forth the investment results of our general account apportioned between pfi excluding the closed block division and the closed block division, for the periods indicated. the yields are based on net investment income as reported under u.s. gaap and as such do not include certain interest-related items, such as settlements of duration management swaps which are included in "realized investment gains (losses), net." effective january 1, 2016, the company classified fixed maturity prepayment fees and call premiums in "net investment income" rather than "realized investments gains (losses), net." the impact of this change for the year ended december 31, 2015 was immaterial.

(1)   yields are based on quarterly average carrying values except for fixed maturities, equity securities and securities lending activity. yields for fixed maturities are based on quarterly average amortized cost. yields for equity securities are based on quarterly average cost. yields for fixed maturities, short-term investments and cash equivalents are calculated net of liabilities and rebate expenses corresponding to securities lending activity. yields exclude investment income on assets other than those included in invested assets.
(2)   includes net investment income of our investment management operations and derivative operations.
(3)   the total yield was 3.97%, 3.92% and 3.98% for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
the increase in net investment income yield attributable to our general account investments, excluding both the closed block division and the japanese insurance operations' portfolio, for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily the result of higher yields from non-coupon investments.
the decrease in net investment income yield attributable to our general account investments, excluding both the closed block division and the japanese insurance operations' portfolio, for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily the result of lower fixed income reinvestment rates and lower yields from non-coupon investments offset by higher fixed maturity prepayment fees and call premiums.
the decrease in net investment income yield on the japanese insurance operations' portfolio for 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to lower fixed income reinvestment rates, partially offset by higher yields from non-coupon investments and higher fixed maturity prepayment fees and call premiums.
the decrease in net investment income yield on the japanese insurance operations' portfolio for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to lower fixed income reinvestment rates and lower yields from non-coupon investments.
both the u.s. dollar-denominated and australian dollar-denominated fixed maturities that are not hedged to yen through third-party derivative contracts provide a yield that is substantially higher than the yield on comparable yen-denominated fixed maturities. the average amortized cost of u.s. dollar-denominated fixed maturities that are not hedged to yen through third-party derivative contracts was approximately $41.4 billion and $37.7 billion, for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the majority of u.s. dollar-denominated fixed maturities support liabilities that are denominated in u.s. dollars. the average amortized cost of australian dollar-denominated fixed maturities that are not hedged to yen through third-party derivative contracts was approximately $10.2 billion and $9.5 billion, for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the australian dollar-denominated fixed maturities support liabilities that are denominated in australian dollars. for additional information regarding u.s. and australian dollar investments held in our japanese insurance operations, see "-results of operations-impact of foreign currency exchange rates" above.

retail-related investments as of december 31, 2017, pfi excluding the closed block division had retail-related investments of approximately $15 billion consisting primarily of $7 billion of corporate fixed maturities of which 89% were considered investment grade; $7 billion of commercial mortgage loans with a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of approximately 49% and weighted-average debt service coverage ratio of 2.42 times; and $1 billion of real estate held through direct ownership and real estate-related joint ventures and limited partnerships.
in addition, we held approximately $9 billion of commercial mortgage-backed securities, of which approximately 91% and 9% were rated aaa (super-senior) and aa, respectively, and comprised of diversified collateral pools. approximately 30% of the collateral pools were comprised of retail-related investments, with no pools solely collateralized by retail-related investments. for additional information regarding commercial mortgage-backed securities, see "-fixed maturity securities-fixed maturity securities credit quality" below.
general account investments of pfi excluding closed block division in the following sections, we provide details about our investment portfolio, excluding investments held in the closed block division. we believe the details of the composition of our investment portfolio excluding the closed block division are most relevant to an understanding of our operations that are pertinent to investors in prudential financial, inc. because substantially all closed block division assets support obligations and liabilities relating to the closed block policies only. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the closed block.

(1)   investment data has been classified based on standard industry categorizations for domestic public holdings and similar classifications by industry for all other holdings.
(2)   includes $381 million of gross unrealized gains and less than $1 million of gross unrealized losses, as of december 31, 2017, compared to $380 million of gross unrealized gains and $0 million of gross unrealized losses, as of december 31, 2016, on securities classified as held-to-maturity.
(3)   as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, based on amortized cost, 75% and 76%, respectively, represent japanese government bonds held by our japanese insurance operations with no other individual country representing more than 11% and 10% of the balance, respectively.
(4)   as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, based on amortized cost, more than 99% and 95% were rated a or higher, respectively.
(5)   excluded from the table above are securities held outside the general account in other entities and operations. for additional information regarding investments held outside the general account, see "-invested assets of other entities and operations" below. also excluded from the table above are fixed maturity securities classified as trading. see "-trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities" and "-other trading account assets" below for additional information.
the increase in net unrealized gains from december 31, 2016 to december 31, 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in u.s. interest rates and credit spread tightening.

fixed maturity securities credit quality the securities valuation office ("svo") of the naic evaluates the investments of insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called "naic designations." in general, naic designations of "1" highest quality, or "2" high quality, include fixed maturities considered investment grade, which include securities rated baa3 or higher by moody's or bbb- or higher by standard & poor's. naic designations of "3" through "6" generally include fixed maturities referred to as below investment grade, which include securities rated ba1 or lower by moody's and bb+ or lower by standard & poor's. the naic designations for commercial mortgage-backed securities and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, including our asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, are based on security level expected losses as modeled by an independent third-party (engaged by the naic) and the statutory carrying value of the security, including any purchase discounts or impairment charges previously recognized.
as a result of time lags between the funding of investments, the finalization of legal documents, and the completion of the svo filing process, the fixed maturity portfolio includes certain securities that have not yet been designated by the svo as of each balance sheet date. pending receipt of svo designations, the categorization of these securities by naic designation is based on the expected ratings indicated by internal analysis.
investments of our international insurance companies are not subject to naic guidelines. investments of our japanese insurance operations are regulated locally by the fsa, an agency of the japanese government. the fsa has its own investment quality criteria and risk control standards. our japanese insurance companies comply with the fsa's credit quality review and risk monitoring guidelines. the credit quality ratings of the investments of our japanese insurance companies are based on ratings assigned by nationally recognized credit rating agencies, including moody's and standard & poor's, or rating equivalents based on ratings assigned by japanese credit ratings agencies.

credit derivative exposure to public fixed maturities in addition to the public fixed maturities noted above, as part of investment portfolio repositioning, we may from time to time sell credit derivatives to manage the credit exposure of our investment portfolio by synthetically creating investments similar to public fixed maturities.
in a credit derivative, we may sell credit protection on an identified name or a broad-based index, and in return receive a quarterly premium. the majority of the underlying reference names in single name and index credit derivatives where we have sold credit protection, as well as all the counterparties to these agreements, are investment grade credit quality, and our credit derivatives have a remaining term to maturity of thirty years or less. the premium or credit spread generally corresponds to the difference between the yield on the reference name's (or index's underlying reference names) public fixed maturity cash instruments and swap rates at the time the agreement is executed. credit derivative contracts are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value, including the premiums received, recorded in "realized investment gains (losses), net."
as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, pfi excluding the closed block division had $1,136 million and $162 million of notional amounts of exposure where we have sold credit protection through credit derivatives, respectively, reported at fair value as an asset of $20 million and less than $1 million, respectively. "realized investment gains (losses), net" from credit derivatives we sold were a gain of $3 million and $7 million for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the balance at december 31, 2016 excludes a credit derivative related to surplus notes issued by a subsidiary of prudential insurance, with notional amount of $500 million and reported fair value as a liability of $17 million, which was terminated in september 2017. see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this derivative.
in addition to selling credit protection, we have purchased credit protection using credit derivatives in order to hedge specific credit exposures in our investment portfolio. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, pfi excluding the closed block division had $100 million and $141 million of notional amounts, respectively, reported at fair value as a liability of $1 million and $4 million, respectively. "realized investment gains (losses), net" from credit derivatives we purchased were a loss of $2 million and $5 million for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding credit derivatives and an overall description of our derivative activities.
otti of fixed maturity securities

we maintain separate monitoring processes for public and private fixed maturities and create watch lists to highlight securities that require special scrutiny and management. our public fixed maturity investment managers review all public fixed maturity holdings on a quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration whether due to ratings downgrades, unexpected price variances and/or company or industry-specific concerns.
for private placements, our credit and portfolio management processes help ensure prudent controls over valuation and management. we have separate pricing and authorization processes to establish "checks and balances" for new investments. we apply consistent standards of credit analysis and due diligence for all transactions, whether they originate through our own in-house origination staff or through agents. our regional offices closely monitor the portfolios in their regions. we set all valuation standards centrally, and we assess the fair value of all investments quarterly. our private fixed maturity investment managers formally review all private fixed maturity holdings on a quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration whether due to ratings downgrades, unexpected price variances and/or company or industry-specific concerns. for additional information regarding our otti policies for fixed maturity securities, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
otti of general account fixed maturity securities attributable to pfi excluding the closed block division that were recognized in earnings were $169 million, $144 million and $97 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. for a further discussion of otti, see "-realized investment gains and losses" above.

we originate commercial mortgage and agricultural property loans using a dedicated investment staff through our various regional offices in the u.s. and international offices primarily in london and tokyo. all loans are underwritten consistently to our standards using a proprietary quality rating system that has been developed from our experience in real estate and mortgage lending.
uncollateralized loans primarily represent corporate loans which do not meet the definition of a security under authoritative accounting guidance.
residential property loans primarily include japanese recourse loans. upon default of these recourse loans, we can make a claim against the personal assets of the property owner, in addition to the mortgaged property. these loans are also backed by third-party guarantors.
other collateralized loans include consumer loans.

loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios are measures commonly used to assess the quality of commercial mortgage and agricultural property loans. the loan-to-value ratio compares the amount of the loan to the fair value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan and is commonly expressed as a percentage. a loan-to-value ratio less than 100% indicates an excess of collateral value over the loan amount. loan-to-value ratios greater than 100% indicate that the loan amount exceeds the collateral value. the debt service coverage ratio compares a property's net operating income to its debt service payments. debt service coverage ratios less than 1.0 times indicate that property operations do not generate enough income to cover the loan's current debt payments. a debt service coverage ratio greater than 1.0 times indicates an excess of net operating income over the debt service payments.

as of december 31, 2017, our commercial mortgage and agricultural property loans attributable to pfi excluding the closed block division had a weighted-average debt service coverage ratio of 2.45 times and a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of 54%. as of december 31, 2017, approximately 97% of commercial mortgage and agricultural property loans were fixed rate loans. for those commercial mortgage and agricultural property loans that were originated in 2017, the weighted-average debt service coverage ratio was 2.71 times, and the weighted-average loan-to-value ratio was 63%.
the values utilized in calculating these loan-to-value ratios are developed as part of our periodic review of the commercial mortgage and agricultural property loan portfolio, which includes an internal evaluation of the underlying collateral value. our periodic review also includes a quality re-rating process, whereby we update the internal quality rating originally assigned at underwriting based on the proprietary quality rating system mentioned above. as discussed below, the internal quality rating is a key input in determining our allowance for losses.
for loans with collateral under construction, renovation or lease-up, a stabilized value and projected net operating income are used in the calculation of the loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios. our commercial mortgage and agricultural property loan portfolio included approximately $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion of such loans as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. all else being equal, these loans are inherently riskier than those collateralized by properties that have already stabilized. as of december 31, 2017, there were no loan-specific reserves related to these loans. in addition, these unstabilized loans are included in the calculation of our portfolio reserve as discussed below.

commercial mortgage and other loans quality the portfolio is reviewed on an ongoing basis; and if certain criteria are met, loans are assigned one of the following "watch list" categories: 1) "closely monitored" includes a variety of considerations such as when loan metrics fall below acceptable levels, the borrower is not cooperative or has requested a material modification, or at the direction of the portfolio manager, 2) "not in good standing" includes loans in default or there is a high probability of loss of principal, such as when the loan is in the process of foreclosure or the borrower is in bankruptcy. our workout and special servicing professionals manage the loans on the watch list.
we establish an allowance for losses to provide for the risk of credit losses inherent in the lending process. the allowance includes loan-specific reserves for loans that are determined to be impaired as a result of our loan review process and a portfolio reserve for probable incurred but not specifically identified losses for loans which are not on the watch list. we define an impaired loan as a loan for which we estimate it is probable that amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected. the loan-specific portion of the valuation allowance is based on our assessment as to ultimate collectability of loan principal and interest. valuation allowances for an impaired loan are recorded based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, or based on the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. the portfolio reserve for incurred but not specifically identified losses considers the current credit composition of the portfolio based on the internal quality ratings mentioned above. the portfolio reserves are determined using past loan experience, including historical credit migration, loss probability and loss severity factors by property type. these factors are reviewed and updated as appropriate. the valuation allowance for commercial mortgage and other loans can increase or decrease from period to period based on these factors.

other trading account assets other trading account assets are primarily related to assets associated with consolidated variable interest entities for which the company is the investment manager, as well as our derivative operations used to manage interest rate, foreign currency, credit and equity exposures. the assets of the consolidated variable interest entities are generally offset by liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected. for further information on these consolidated variable interest entities, see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
122
commercial mortgage and other loans our investment management operations include our commercial mortgage operations, which provide mortgage origination, investment management and servicing for our general account, institutional clients, the federal housing administration and government-sponsored entities such as fannie mae and freddie mac.
the mortgage loans of our commercial mortgage operations are included in "commercial mortgage and other loans." derivatives and other hedging instruments related to our commercial mortgage operations are primarily included in "other long-term investments."
other long-term investments other long-term investments primarily include strategic investments made as part of our investment management operations. we make these strategic investments in real estate, as well as fixed income, public equity and real estate securities, including controlling interests. certain of these investments are made primarily for purposes of co-investment in our managed funds and structured products. other strategic investments are made with the intention to sell or syndicate to investors, including our general account, or for placement in funds and structured products that we offer and manage (seed investments). as part of our investment management operations, we also make loans to our managed funds that are secured by equity commitments from investors or assets of the funds. other long-term investments also include certain assets in consolidated investment funds where the company is deemed to exercise control over the funds.
liquidity and capital resources overview liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet the payment obligations of the company. capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operations of our businesses, fund business growth, and provide a cushion to withstand adverse circumstances. our ability to generate and maintain sufficient liquidity and capital depends on the profitability of our businesses, general economic conditions and our access to the capital markets and the alternate sources of liquidity and capital described herein.
effective and prudent liquidity and capital management is a priority across the organization. management monitors the liquidity of prudential financial and its subsidiaries on a daily basis and projects borrowing and capital needs over a multi-year time horizon through our periodic planning process. we believe that cash flows from the sources of funds available to us are sufficient to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of prudential financial and its subsidiaries, including under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios. we have a capital management framework in place that governs the allocation of capital and approval of capital uses. we also employ a capital protection framework to ensure the availability of capital resources to maintain adequate capitalization on a consolidated basis and competitive rbc ratios and solvency margins for our insurance subsidiaries under various stress scenarios.
prudential financial is a designated financial company under dodd-frank. as a designated financial company, prudential financial is subject to supervision and examination by the federal reserve bank of boston and to stricter prudential regulatory standards, which include or will include requirements and limitations (many of which are the subject of ongoing rule-making) relating to capital, leverage, liquidity, stress-testing, overall risk management, resolution and recovery plans, credit exposure reporting, early remediation, management interlocks and credit concentration. they may also include additional standards regarding enhanced public disclosure, short-term debt limits and other related subjects. in addition, the financial stability board has identified the company as a g-sii. for information on these regulatory initiatives and their potential impact on us, see "business-regulation" and "risk factors."
during 2017, we took the following significant actions that impacted our liquidity and capital position:
â€¢   we repurchased $1.25 billion of shares of our common stock and declared aggregate common stock dividends of $1.3 billion;
â€¢   we issued $750 million of junior subordinated notes to be utilized for general corporate purposes, which may include refinancing of our $600 million aggregate principal amount of 8.875% fixed-to-floating rate junior subordinated notes and portions of our medium-term notes maturing through 2018;
â€¢   we completed a debt exchange offer, pursuant to which we issued $1.9 billion in principal amount of senior notes in exchange for $1.5 billion in principal amount of outstanding medium-term notes;
â€¢   we redeemed $1.0 billion of debt previously issued through our captive financing facilities supporting regulation xxx and guideline axxx non-economic reserves; and
123
â€¢   we obtained additional financing for guideline axxx reserves by entering into a new captive financing facility for $1.0 billion, of which $560 million was outstanding as of december 31, 2017.
capital our capital management framework is primarily based on statutory rbc and solvency margin measures. due to our diverse mix of businesses and applicable regulatory requirements, we apply certain refinements to the framework that are designed to more appropriately reflect risks associated with our businesses on a consistent basis across the company.
we seek to capitalize all of our subsidiaries and businesses in accordance with their ratings targets, and we believe prudential financial's capitalization and use of financial leverage are consistent with those ratings targets, including considering the impacts of the tax act of 2017. our long-term senior debt rating targets for prudential financial are "a" for standard & poor's rating services ("s&p"), moody's investors service, inc. ("moody's"), and fitch ratings ltd. ("fitch"), and "a" for a.m. best company ("a.m. best"). our financial strength rating targets for our life insurance companies are "aa/aa/aa" for s&p, moody's and fitch, respectively, and "a+" for a.m. best. some entities may currently be rated below these targets, and not all life insurance companies are rated by each of these rating agencies. see "-ratings" below for a description of the potential impacts of ratings downgrades.
capital governance our capital management framework is ultimately reviewed and approved by our board of directors (the "board"). the board has adopted a capital policy that authorizes our chairman and chief executive officer and vice chairman to approve certain capital actions on behalf of the company and to further delegate authority with respect to capital actions to appropriate officers. any capital commitment that exceeds the authority granted to senior management under the capital policy is separately authorized by the board.
in addition, our capital and finance committee ("cfc") reviews the use and allocation of capital above certain threshold amounts to promote the efficient use of capital, consistent with our strategic objectives, ratings aspirations and other goals and targets. this management committee provides a multi-disciplinary due diligence review of specific initiatives or transactions requiring the use of capital, including mergers and acquisitions. the cfc also reviews our annual capital plan (and updates to this plan), as well as our capital, liquidity and financial position, borrowing plans, and related matters prior to the discussion of these items with the board.
capitalization the primary components of the company's capitalization consist of equity and outstanding capital debt, including junior subordinated debt. as shown in the table below, as of december 31, 2017, the company had $49.0 billion in capital, all of which was available to support the aggregate capital requirements of its divisions and its corporate and other operations. based on our assessment of these businesses and operations, we believe this level of capital is consistent with our ratings targets.

(1)   amounts attributable to prudential financial, excluding aoci.
the decrease in other capital debt from december 31, 2016 primarily reflects the maturity of senior debt that was previously utilized to meet capital requirements of our businesses.
insurance regulatory capital we manage prudential insurance, prudential of japan, gibraltar life, and our other domestic and international insurance subsidiaries to regulatory capital levels consistent with our "aa" ratings targets. we utilize the rbc ratio as a primary measure of the capital adequacy of our domestic insurance subsidiaries and the solvency margin ratio as a primary measure of the capital adequacy of our international insurance subsidiaries.
124
rbc is calculated based on statutory financial statements and risk formulas consistent with the practices of the naic. rbc considers, among other things, risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets, insurance-related risks associated with an insurer's products and liabilities, interest rate risks and general business risks. rbc ratio calculations are intended to assist insurance regulators in measuring an insurer's solvency and ability to pay future claims. the reporting of rbc measures is not intended for the purpose of ranking any insurance company or for use in connection with any marketing, advertising or promotional activities, but is available to the public.
the table below presents the rbc ratios of our most significant domestic insurance subsidiaries as of december 31, 2016, the most recent statutory fiscal year-end for these subsidiaries for which rbc information has been filed.
ratio prudential insurance(1)                            457   %
palac                                              867   %
composite major u.s. insurance subsidiaries(2)     527   %
__________
(1)   includes priac, pruco life, plnj (which is a subsidiary of pruco life) and plic.
(2)   includes prudential insurance and its subsidiaries, as noted above, and palac. composite rbc is not reported to regulators and is based on the summation of total adjusted capital and risk charges for the included companies as determined under statutory accounting and rbc guidance to calculate a composite numerator and denominator, respectively, for purposes of calculating the composite ratio.
we expect that the tax act of 2017 will adversely affect the statutory capital position of our domestic insurance companies as of december 31, 2017, due to the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and the resulting reduction in the value of statutory deferred tax assets and increase in certain statutory reserves. nevertheless, although not yet filed, we expect the prudential insurance, palac and composite rbc ratios to be greater than 400% as of december 31, 2017, even after giving effect to impacts from the tax act of 2017.
in addition, the naic is expected to revise the rbc requirements for future periods to reflect the tax act of 2017, which may further adversely affect the statutory capital position of our domestic insurance subsidiaries in future periods. while the impact of the naic rules will not be fully known until the final updated rbc requirements are formally issued and adopted, the updated requirements may cause the regulatory capital levels of our domestic insurance subsidiaries to be below our "aa" ratings targets, in which case we would expect to fund any additional capital necessary to get back to our target levels using available capital and/or funding obtained through the capital markets.
similar to the rbc ratios that are employed by u.s. insurance regulators, regulatory authorities in the international jurisdictions in which we operate generally establish some form of minimum solvency margin requirements for insurance companies based on local statutory accounting practices. these solvency margins are a primary measure of the capital adequacy of our international insurance operations. maintenance of our solvency margins at certain levels is also important to our competitive positioning, as in certain jurisdictions, such as japan, these solvency margins are required to be disclosed to the public and therefore impact the public perception of an insurer's financial strength.
the table below presents the solvency margin ratios of our most significant international insurance subsidiaries as of september 30, 2017, the most recent date for which this information is available.
ratio prudential of japan consolidated(1)     893   %
gibraltar life consolidated(2)          935   %
__________
(1)   includes prudential trust co., ltd., a subsidiary of prudential of japan.
(2)   includes pgfl, a subsidiary of gibraltar life.
although not yet filed, we expect the solvency margin ratio for each of these subsidiaries to be greater than 700% as of december 31, 2017.
all of our domestic and significant international insurance subsidiaries have capital levels that substantially exceed the minimum level required by applicable insurance regulations. our regulatory capital levels may be affected in the future by changes to the applicable regulations, proposals for which are currently under consideration by both domestic and international insurance regulators. for further information on the calculation of rbc and solvency margin ratios, as well as regulatory minimums, see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
capital protection framework
125
we employ a "capital protection framework" (the "framework") to ensure that sufficient capital resources are available to maintain adequate capitalization on a consolidated basis and competitive rbc ratios and solvency margins for our insurance subsidiaries under various stress scenarios. the framework incorporates the potential impacts from market related stresses, including equity markets, real estate, interest rates, credit losses, and foreign currency exchange rates. in evaluating these potential impacts, we assess risk holistically at the enterprise level, recognizing that our business mix may produce results that partially offset on a net basis.
the framework accommodates periodic volatility within ranges that we deem acceptable, while also providing for additional potential sources of capital, which include on-balance sheet capital capacity and contingent sources of capital. we believe we currently have access to sufficient resources to maintain adequate capitalization and competitive rbc ratios and solvency margins under a range of potential stress scenarios.
captive reinsurance companies we use captive reinsurance companies in our domestic insurance operations to more effectively manage our reserves and capital on an economic basis and to enable the aggregation and transfer of risks. our captive reinsurance companies assume business from affiliates only. to support the risks they assume, our captives are capitalized to a level we believe is consistent with the "aa" financial strength rating targets of our insurance subsidiaries. all of our captive reinsurance companies are wholly-owned subsidiaries and are located domestically, typically in the state of domicile of the direct writing insurance subsidiary that cedes the majority of business to the captive. in addition to state insurance regulation, our captives are subject to internal policies governing their activities. in the normal course of business we contribute capital to the captives to support business growth and other needs. prudential financial has also entered into support agreements with the captives in connection with financing arrangements.
our domestic life insurance subsidiaries are subject to a regulation entitled "valuation of life insurance policies model regulation," commonly known as "regulation xxx," and a supporting guideline entitled "the application of the valuation of life insurance policies model regulation," commonly known as "guideline axxx." the regulation and supporting guideline require insurers to establish statutory reserves for term and universal life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees at a level that exceeds what our actuarial assumptions for this business would otherwise require. we use captive reinsurance companies to finance the portion of the reserves for this business that we consider to be non-economic as described below under "-financing activities-subsidiary borrowings-financing of regulatory reserves associated with domestic life insurance products."
shareholder distributions share repurchase program and shareholder dividends in december 2016, the board authorized the company to repurchase at management's discretion up to $1.25 billion of its outstanding common stock during the period from january 1, 2017 through december 31, 2017.
in december 2017, the board authorized the company to repurchase at management's discretion up to $1.5 billion of its outstanding common stock during the period from january 1, 2018 through december 31, 2018.
the timing and amount of share repurchases are determined by management based on market conditions and other considerations, including any increased capital needs of our businesses due to, among other things, changes in regulatory capital requirements and opportunities for growth and acquisitions. repurchases may be effected in the open market, through derivative, accelerated repurchase and other negotiated transactions and through plans designed to comply with rule 10b5-1(c) under the exchange act.

in addition, on february 7, 2018, the board declared a cash dividend of $0.90 per share of common stock, payable on march 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of february 21, 2018.
liquidity the principles of our liquidity management framework are described in an enterprise-wide liquidity management policy that is reviewed and approved by the board. liquidity management and stress testing are performed on a legal entity basis as the ability to transfer funds between subsidiaries is limited due in part to regulatory restrictions. liquidity needs are determined through daily and quarterly cash flow forecasting at the holding company and within our operating subsidiaries. a minimum balance of highly liquid assets of at least $1.3 billion is targeted to ensure that adequate liquidity is available at prudential financial to cover fixed expenses in the event that we experience reduced cash flows from our operating subsidiaries at a time when access to capital markets is also not available. this targeted minimum balance is reviewed and approved annually by the board.
we seek to mitigate the risk of having limited or no access to financing due to stressed market conditions by generally pre-funding debt in advance of maturity. we mitigate the refinancing risk associated with our debt that is used to fund operating needs by matching the term of debt with the assets financed. to ensure adequate liquidity in stress scenarios, stress testing is performed for our major operating subsidiaries. we seek to further mitigate liquidity risk by maintaining our access to alternative sources of liquidity, as discussed below.
liquidity of prudential financial the principal sources of funds available to prudential financial, the parent holding company, are dividends, returns of capital and loans from subsidiaries, and proceeds from debt issuances and certain stock-based compensation activity. these sources of funds may be supplemented by prudential financial's access to the capital markets as well as the "-alternative sources of liquidity" described below.
the primary uses of funds at prudential financial include servicing debt, making capital contributions and loans to subsidiaries, paying declared shareholder dividends and repurchasing outstanding shares of common stock executed under authority from the board.
as of december 31, 2017, prudential financial had highly liquid assets with a carrying value totaling $5,190 million. highly liquid assets predominantly include cash, short-term investments, u.s. treasury securities, obligations of other u.s. government authorities and agencies, and/or foreign government bonds. we maintain an intercompany liquidity account that is designed to optimize the use of cash by facilitating the lending and borrowing of funds between prudential financial and its subsidiaries on a daily basis. excluding net borrowings from this intercompany liquidity account, prudential financial had highly liquid assets of $4,376 million as of december 31, 2017, a decrease of $177 million from december 31, 2016.
the following table sets forth prudential financial's principal sources and uses of highly liquid assets, excluding net borrowings from our intercompany liquidity account, for the periods indicated.

(2)   2017 includes net receipts from subsidiaries of $1,323 million from international subsidiaries offset by net borrowing of $500 million by prudential universal reinsurance company, $350 million by prudential arizona reinsurance universal company, $274 million by investment management subsidiaries, and $9 million by other subsidiaries. 2016 includes net receipts from subsidiaries of $378 million from pruco life, $116 million from plnj, net proceeds of $644 million from the issuance of notes to international insurance subsidiaries, offset by net borrowing of $600 million by prudential universal reinsurance company, $490 million by investment management subsidiaries and $5 million by other subsidiaries. amounts above exclude receipts associated with the variable annuities recapture.
(3)   effective april 1, 2016, we recaptured the risks related to our variable annuities living benefit riders and certain retirement products that were previously reinsured to a captive reinsurance company. these risks were recaptured by the insurance entities that issued the base contracts, thereby allowing us to manage the capital and liquidity risks of these products more efficiently by aggregating both the risks and the assets supporting these risks within these insurance entities. this series of transactions is collectively referred to as the "variable annuities recapture."
(4)   includes cash payments made on dividends declared in prior periods.
(5)   2017 includes capital contributions of $965 million to international insurance subsidiaries, $149 million to prudential insurance, and $21 million to investment management subsidiaries. 2016 includes capital contributions of $824 million to international insurance subsidiaries, $36 million to pruco re, $74 million to investment management subsidiaries, and $5 million to other subsidiaries. amounts above exclude capital contributions associated with the variable annuities recapture.
restrictions on dividends and returns of capital from subsidiaries our insurance companies are subject to limitations on the payment of dividends and other transfers of funds to prudential financial and other affiliates under applicable insurance law and regulation. also, more generally, the payment of dividends by any of our subsidiaries is subject to declaration by their board of directors and can be affected by market conditions and other factors. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for details on specific dividend restrictions.
domestic insurance subsidiaries. prudential insurance is permitted to pay ordinary dividends based on calculations specified under new jersey insurance law, subject to prior notification to njdobi. any distributions above this amount in any twelve month period are considered to be "extraordinary" dividends, and the approval of the njodbi is required prior to payment. the laws regulating dividends of the states where our other domestic insurance companies are domiciled are similar, but not identical, to new jersey's. during 2017, prudential financial received an ordinary dividend of $1.0 billion from prudential insurance and extraordinary dividends of $950 million from palac.

international insurance subsidiaries. capital redeployment from our international insurance subsidiaries is subject to local regulatory requirements in the international jurisdictions in which they operate. our most significant international insurance subsidiaries, prudential of japan and gibraltar life, are permitted to pay common stock dividends based on calculations specified by japanese insurance law, subject to prior notification to the fsa. dividends in excess of these amounts and other forms of capital distribution require the prior approval of the fsa. in addition to paying common stock dividends, international insurance operations may return capital to prudential financial through other means, such as the repayment of subordinated debt or preferred stock obligations held by prudential financial or other affiliates. the regulatory fiscal year end for both prudential of japan and gibraltar life is march 31, 2018, after which time the common stock dividend amount permitted to be paid without prior approval from the fsa can be determined.
as of december 31, 2017, prudential holdings of japan, inc. ("phj"), the parent of the company's japanese operations, retained $248 million of dividends received from its international insurance subsidiaries in 2016, that remained available to be paid as a dividend to prudential financial.
other subsidiaries. the ability of our asset management subsidiaries and the majority of our other operating subsidiaries to pay dividends is largely unrestricted from a regulatory standpoint.
liquidity of insurance subsidiaries we manage the liquidity of our insurance operations to ensure stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of cash flows to meet all of our obligations. liquidity within each of our insurance subsidiaries is provided by a variety of sources, including portfolios of liquid assets. the investment portfolios of our subsidiaries are integral to the overall liquidity of our insurance operations. we segment our investment portfolios and employ an asset/liability management approach specific to the requirements of each of our product lines. this enhances the discipline applied in managing the liquidity, as well as the interest rate and credit risk profiles, of each portfolio in a manner consistent with the unique characteristics of the product liabilities.
liquidity is measured against internally-developed benchmarks that take into account the characteristics of both the asset portfolio and the liabilities that they support. we consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets (for example, type of asset and credit quality) in calculating internal liquidity measures to evaluate our insurance operations' liquidity under various stress scenarios, including company-specific and market-wide events. we continue to believe that cash generated by ongoing operations and the liquidity profile of our assets provide sufficient liquidity under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios for each of our insurance subsidiaries.
cash flow the principal sources of liquidity for our insurance subsidiaries are premiums, investment and fee income, and investment maturities and sales associated with our insurance and annuity operations, as well as internal and external borrowings. the principal uses of that liquidity include benefits, claims and dividends paid to policyholders, and payments to policyholders and contractholders in connection with surrenders, withdrawals and net policy loan activity. other uses of liquidity may include commissions, general and administrative expenses, purchases of investments, the payment of dividends to the parent holding company, hedging and reinsurance activity and payments in connection with financing activities.
in each of our major insurance subsidiaries, we believe that the cash flows from operations are adequate to satisfy current liquidity requirements, including considering the impacts of the tax act of 2017. the continued adequacy of this liquidity will depend upon factors such as future securities market conditions, changes in interest rate levels, policyholder perceptions of our financial strength, policyholder behavior, catastrophic events and the relative safety and attractiveness of competing products, each of which could lead to reduced cash inflows or increased cash outflows. our insurance operations' cash flows from investment activities result from repayments of principal, proceeds from maturities and sales of invested assets and investment income, net of amounts reinvested. the primary liquidity risks with respect to these cash flows are the risk of default by debtors or bond insurers, our counterparties' willingness to extend repurchase and/or securities lending arrangements, commitments to invest and market volatility. we closely manage these risks through our credit risk management process and regular monitoring of our liquidity position.
domestic insurance operations. in managing the liquidity of our domestic insurance operations, we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions when selecting assets to support these contractual obligations. we use surrender charges and other contract provisions to mitigate the extent, timing and profitability impact of withdrawals of funds by customers. the following table sets forth the liabilities for future policy benefits and policyholders' account balances of certain of our domestic insurance subsidiaries as of the dates indicated.

the liabilities presented above are primarily supported by invested assets in our general account. as noted above, when selecting assets to support these contractual obligations, we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions. as a result, assets will include both liquid assets, as discussed below, and other assets that we believe adequately support our liabilities.
for prudential insurance and other subsidiaries, the liabilities presented above primarily include annuity reserves and deposit liabilities and individual life insurance policy reserves. individual life insurance policies may impose surrender charges and policyholders may be subject to a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy. prudential insurance's reserves for group annuity contracts primarily relate to pension risk transfer contracts, which are generally not subject to early withdrawal. for our individual annuity contracts, to encourage persistency, most of our variable and fixed annuities have surrender or withdrawal charges for a specified number of years. in addition, certain fixed annuities impose a market value adjustment if the invested amount is not held to maturity. the living benefit features of our variable annuities also encourage persistency because the potential value of the living benefit is fully realized only if the contract persists.
for priac, the liabilities presented above primarily include reserves for stable value contracts. although many of these contracts are subject to discretionary withdrawal, withdrawals are typically at the market value of the underlying assets. risk is further reduced by the high persistency of clients driven in part by our competitive position in our target markets and contractual provisions such as deferred payouts.
gross account withdrawals for our domestic insurance operations' products in 2017 were generally consistent with our assumptions in asset/liability management, and the associated cash outflows did not have a material adverse impact on our overall liquidity.
international insurance operations. as with our domestic operations, in managing the liquidity of our international insurance operations, we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions in selecting assets to support these contractual obligations. the following table sets forth the liabilities for future policy benefits and policyholders' account balances of certain of our international insurance subsidiaries as of the dates indicated.

we believe most of the longer-term recurring pay individual life insurance policies sold by our japanese operations do not have significant withdrawal risk because policyholders may incur surrender charges and must undergo a new underwriting process to obtain a new insurance policy.
gibraltar life sells fixed annuities, denominated in u.s. and australian dollars, that may be subject to increased surrenders should the yen depreciate in relation to these currencies or if interest rates in australia and the u.s. decline relative to japan. a significant portion of the liabilities associated with these contracts include a market value adjustment feature, which mitigates the profitability impact from surrenders. as of december 31, 2017, products with a market value adjustment feature represented $24.5 billion of our japan operations' insurance-related liabilities, which included $20.6 billion attributable to non-yen denominated fixed annuities.
liquid assets liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, u.s. treasury securities, fixed maturities that are not designated as held-to-maturity and public equity securities. in addition to access to substantial investment portfolios, our insurance companies' liquidity is managed through access to a variety of instruments available for funding and/or managing cash flow mismatches, including from time to time those arising from claim levels in excess of projections. our ability to utilize assets and liquidity between our subsidiaries is limited by regulatory and other constraints. we believe that ongoing operations and the liquidity profile of our assets provide sufficient liquidity under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios for each of our insurance subsidiaries.

given the size and liquidity profile of our investment portfolios, we believe that claim experience, including policyholder withdrawals and surrenders, varying from our projections does not constitute a significant liquidity risk. our asset/liability management process takes into account the expected maturity of investments and expected claim payments as well as the specific nature and risk profile of the liabilities. to the extent we need to pay claims in excess of projections, we may borrow temporarily or sell investments sooner than anticipated to pay these claims, which may result in increased borrowing costs or realized investment gains or losses, including from changes in interest rates or credit spreads. the payment of claims and sale of investments earlier than anticipated would have an impact on the reported level of cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities, in our financial statements. historically, there has been no significant variation between the expected maturities of our investments and the payment of claims.
liquidity associated with other activities hedging activities associated with individual annuities for the portion of our individual annuities' alm strategy executed through hedging, as well as the capital hedge program, we enter into a range of exchange-traded, cleared and other otc equity and interest rate derivatives in order to hedge certain capital market risks related to more severe market conditions. for a full discussion of our individual annuities' risk management strategy, see "-results of operations by segment-u.s. individual solutions division-individual annuities." this portion of our individual annuities' alm strategy and capital hedge program requires access to liquidity to meet payment obligations relating to these derivatives, such as payments for periodic settlements, purchases, maturities and terminations. these liquidity needs can vary materially due to, among other items, changes in interest rates, equity markets, mortality and policyholder behavior.
the hedging portion of our individual annuities' alm strategy and capital hedge program may also result in derivatives-related collateral postings to (when we are in a net pay position) or from (when we are in a net receive position) counterparties. the net collateral position depends on changes in interest rates and equity markets related to the amount of the exposures hedged. depending on market conditions, the collateral posting requirements can result in material liquidity needs when we are in a net pay position. as of december 31, 2017, the derivatives comprising the hedging portion of our alm strategy and capital hedge program were in a net receive position of $3.3 billion compared to a net receive position of $3.1 billion as of december 31, 2016. the change in collateral position was primarily driven by a decrease in interest rates.
foreign exchange hedging activities we employ various hedging strategies to manage potential exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements, particularly those associated with the yen. our overall yen hedging strategy calibrates the hedge level to preserve the relative contribution of our yen-based business to the company's overall return on equity on a leverage neutral basis. the hedging strategy includes two primary components:
â€¢   income hedges-we hedge a portion of our prospective yen-based earnings streams by entering into external forward currency derivative contracts that effectively fix the currency exchange rates for that portion of earnings, thereby reducing volatility from foreign currency exchange rate movements. as of december 31, 2017, we have hedged 100%, 73% and 28% of expected yen-based earnings for 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.
â€¢   equity hedges-we hold both internal and external hedges primarily to hedge our u.s. dollar-equivalent equity. these hedges also mitigate volatility in the solvency margins of yen-based subsidiaries resulting from changes in the market value of their u.s. dollar-denominated investments hedging our u.s. dollar-equivalent equity attributable to changes in the yen-u.s. dollar exchange rate.
for additional information on our hedging strategy, see "-results of operations-impact of foreign currency exchange rates."
cash settlements from these hedging activities result in cash flows between subsidiaries of prudential financial and either international-based subsidiaries or external parties. the cash flows are dependent on changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the notional amount of the exposures hedged. for example, a significant yen depreciation over an extended period of time could result in net cash inflows, while a significant yen appreciation could result in net cash outflows. the following tables set forth information about net cash settlements and the net asset or liability resulting from these hedging activities related to the yen and other currencies.

investment management operations the principal sources of liquidity for our fee-based investment management businesses include asset management fees and commercial mortgage origination and servicing fees. the principal uses of liquidity include general and administrative expenses and distributions of dividends and returns of capital to prudential financial. the primary liquidity risks for our fee-based investment management businesses relate to their profitability, which is impacted by market conditions and our investment management performance. we believe the cash flows from our fee-based investment management businesses are adequate to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of these operations, as well as requirements that could arise under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios, which are monitored through the use of internal measures.
the principal sources of liquidity for our strategic investments held in our investment management businesses are cash flows from investments, the ability to liquidate investments, and available borrowing lines from internal sources, including prudential financial and prudential funding, llc ("prudential funding"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of prudential insurance. the primary liquidity risks include the inability to sell assets in a timely manner, declines in the value of assets and credit defaults. there were no material changes to the liquidity position of our investment management operations during 2017.
alternative sources of liquidity in addition to the sources of liquidity discussed above, and asset-based financing as discussed below, prudential financial and certain subsidiaries have access to other sources of liquidity, including syndicated, unsecured committed credit facilities, membership in the federal home loan banks, commercial paper programs, and a put option agreement. see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on these sources of liquidity.
asset-based financing
133
we conduct asset-based or secured financing within our insurance and other subsidiaries, including transactions such as securities lending, repurchase agreements and mortgage dollar rolls, to earn spread income, to borrow funds, or to facilitate trading activity. these programs are primarily driven by portfolio holdings of securities that are lendable based on counterparty demand for these securities in the marketplace. the collateral received in connection with these programs is primarily used to purchase securities in the short-term spread portfolios of our insurance entities. investments held in the short-term spread portfolios include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments (primarily corporate bonds), mortgage loans and fixed maturities (primarily investments in collateralized loan obligations and other structured securities), with a weighted average life at time of purchase by the short-term portfolios of four years or less. floating rate assets comprise the majority of our short-term spread portfolio. these short-term portfolios are subject to specific investment policy statements, which among other things, do not allow for significant asset/liability interest rate duration mismatch.
the following table sets forth our liabilities under asset-based or secured financing programs as of the dates indicated.

as of december 31, 2017, our domestic insurance entities had assets eligible for the asset-based or secured financing programs of $113.8 billion, of which $12.8 billion were on loan. taking into account market conditions and outstanding loan balances as of december 31, 2017, we believe approximately $17.1 billion of the remaining eligible assets are readily lendable, including approximately $12.5 billion relating to pfi excluding the closed block division, of which $3.1 billion relates to certain separate accounts and may only be used for financing activities related to those accounts, and the remaining $4.6 billion relating to the closed block division.
financing activities as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, total short-term and long-term debt of the company on a consolidated basis was $18.6 billion and $19.2 billion, respectively. we may, from time to time, seek to redeem or repurchase our outstanding debt securities through open market purchases, individually negotiated transactions or otherwise. any such repurchases will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity position and other factors. the following table sets forth total consolidated borrowings of the company as of the dates indicated.

(1)   amounts are net of assets under set-off arrangements of $7,287 million and $5,859 million as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
(2)   limited and non-recourse borrowing represents mortgage debt of our subsidiaries that has recourse only to real estate investment property.
as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to the borrowings in the table above. for further information on our short- and long-term debt obligations, see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.
based on the use of proceeds, we classify our borrowings as capital debt, investment-related debt, and debt related to specified businesses. capital debt, which is debt utilized to meet the capital requirements of our businesses, was $12.0 billion and $11.6 billion as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. investment-related debt of $4.0 billion and $5.4 billion as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, consists of debt issued to finance specific investment assets or portfolios of investment assets, the proceeds from which will service the debt. specifically, this includes institutional spread lending investment portfolios, assets supporting reserve requirements under regulation xxx and guideline axxx as described below, as well as funding for institutional and insurance company portfolio cash flow timing differences. our remaining borrowings are utilized for business funding to meet specific purposes, which may include funding new business acquisition costs associated with our individual annuities business, operating needs associated with hedging our individual annuities products as discussed above and activities associated with our investment management business.
prudential financial borrowings long-term borrowings are conducted primarily by prudential financial. it borrows these funds to meet its capital and other funding needs, as well as the capital and funding needs of its subsidiaries. prudential financial maintains a shelf registration statement with the sec that permits the issuance of public debt, equity and hybrid securities. as a "well-known seasoned issuer" under sec rules, prudential financial's shelf registration statement provides for automatic effectiveness upon filing and has no stated issuance capacity.
in december 2017, we completed a debt exchange offer, pursuant to which we issued $1.9 billion in principal amount of senior notes in exchange for $1.5 billion in principal amount of outstanding medium-term notes. the newly-issued notes consist of $1.0 billion maturing in 2049 bearing interest at 3.94% per annum and $900 million maturing in 2047 bearing interest at 3.91% per annum. the medium-term notes received in exchange comprised principal amounts from eight different series of notes with maturity dates between 2033 and 2043 bearing interest at rates between 5.1% and 6.63% per annum.
prudential financial's borrowings increased $0.3 billion from december 31, 2016, driven by the issuance of $0.8 billion of junior subordinated debt, partially offset by maturities of $0.5 billion. for more information on long-term debt, see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
subsidiary borrowings
135
subsidiary borrowings principally consist of commercial paper borrowings by prudential funding, asset-based financing and real estate investment financing. borrowings of our subsidiaries decreased $0.8 billion from december 31, 2016, primarily driven by prepayments of $0.5 billion of senior debt and $0.5 billion of surplus notes, offset by the issuance of $0.2 billion of mortgage debt.
term and universal life reserve financing regulation xxx and guideline axxx require domestic life insurers to establish statutory reserves for term and universal life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees that are consistent with the statutory reserves required for other individual life policies with similar guarantees. many market participants believe that these levels of reserves are excessive relative to the levels reasonably required to maintain solvency for moderately adverse experience. the difference between the statutory reserve and the amount necessary to maintain solvency for moderately adverse experience is considered to be the non-economic portion of the statutory reserve.
we use captive reinsurance subsidiaries to finance the portion of the statutory reserves required to be held by our domestic life insurance companies under regulation xxx and guideline axxx that we consider to be non-economic. the financing arrangements involve the reinsurance of term and universal life business to our captive reinsurers and the issuance of surplus notes by those captives that are treated as capital for statutory purposes. these surplus notes are subordinated to policyholder obligations, and the payment of principal on the surplus notes may only be made with prior insurance regulatory approval.
we have entered into agreements with external counterparties providing for the issuance of surplus notes by our captive reinsurers in return for the receipt of credit-linked notes ("credit-linked note structures"). as of december 31, 2017, we had credit-linked note structures with an aggregate issuance capacity of $11,100 million, of which $9,487 million was outstanding, as compared to an aggregate issuance capacity of $9,150 million, of which $7,759 million was outstanding, as of december 31, 2016. under the agreements, the captive receives in exchange for the surplus notes one or more credit-linked notes issued by a special-purpose affiliate of the company with an aggregate principal amount equal to the surplus notes outstanding. the captive holds the credit-linked notes as assets supporting regulation xxx or guideline axxx non-economic reserves, as applicable. the captive can redeem the principal amount of the outstanding credit-linked notes for cash upon the occurrence of, and in an amount necessary to remedy, a specified liquidity stress event affecting the captive. under the agreements, the external counterparties have agreed to fund any such payments under the credit-linked notes in return for the receipt of fees. under certain of the transactions, prudential financial has agreed to make capital contributions to the captive to reimburse it for investment losses in excess of specified amounts and/or has agreed to reimburse the external counterparties for any payments made under the credit-linked notes. to date, no such payments under the credit-linked notes have been required. under these transactions, because valid rights of set-off exist, interest and principal payments on the surplus notes and on the credit-linked notes are settled on a net basis, and the surplus notes are reflected in the company's total consolidated borrowings on a net basis.
the following table summarizes our credit-linked note structures, which are reported on a net basis, as of december 31, 2017.

(1)   prudential financial has agreed to reimburse any amounts paid under the credit-linked notes issued in this structure.
(2)   the $2.2 billion of surplus notes represents an intercompany transaction that eliminates upon consolidation. prudential financial has agreed to reimburse amounts paid under credit-linked notes issued in this structure up to $1.0 billion.
as of december 31, 2017, we also had outstanding an aggregate of $2.9 billion of debt issued for the purpose of financing regulation xxx and guideline axxx non-economic reserves, of which approximately $0.4 billion relates to regulation xxx reserves and approximately $2.5 billion relates to guideline axxx reserves. in addition, as of december 31, 2017, for purposes of financing guideline axxx reserves, one of our captives had approximately $4.0 billion of surplus notes outstanding that were issued to affiliates.

the naic's actuarial guideline known as "ag 48" requires us to hold cash and rated securities in greater amounts than we previously held to support economic reserves for certain of our term and universal life policies reinsured to a captive. the additional asset requirement through december 31, 2016, was approximately $1 billion, and we expect the requirement as of december 31, 2017, to be an additional $730 million, for a total additional asset requirement of approximately $1.73 billion. we funded the requirements through 2016 using a combination of existing assets and newly purchased assets sourced from affiliated financing, and have funded, or expect to fund, the remaining $730 million in the same manner. we believe we have sufficient internal resources to satisfy the additional asset requirement through 2018.
during 2017, the company adopted principles-based reserving for its guaranteed universal life products and introduced updated versions of these products. the updated products are expected to support the principles-based statutory reserve level without the need for captive reserve financing or additional assets under ag 48. the company is continuing to assess the impact of this new reserving approach on projected statutory reserve levels and product pricing for its remaining portfolio of individual life product offerings.
ratings financial strength ratings (which are sometimes referred to as "claims-paying" ratings) and credit ratings are important factors affecting public confidence in an insurer and its competitive position in marketing products. our credit ratings are also important for our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt and for the cost of such financing. nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations continually review the financial performance and financial condition of the entities they rate, including prudential financial and its rated subsidiaries.
a downgrade in the credit or financial strength ratings of prudential financial or its rated subsidiaries could potentially, among other things, limit our ability to market products, reduce our competitiveness, increase the number or value of policy surrenders and withdrawals, increase our borrowing costs and potentially make it more difficult to borrow funds, adversely affect the availability of financial guarantees, such as letters of credit, cause additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements, allow counterparties to terminate derivative agreements and/or hurt our relationships with creditors, distributors, or trading counterparties thereby potentially negatively affecting our profitability, liquidity, and/or capital. in addition, we consider our own risk of non-performance in determining the fair value of our liabilities. therefore, changes in our credit or financial strength ratings may affect the fair value of our liabilities.
financial strength ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding the financial ability of an insurance company to meet its obligations under an insurance policy. credit ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding an entity's ability to repay its indebtedness. the following table summarizes the ratings for prudential financial and certain of its subsidiaries as of the date of this filing.

the ratings set forth above reflect current opinions of each rating agency. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. these ratings are not directed toward shareholders and do not in any way reflect evaluations of the safety and security of the common stock. these ratings are reviewed periodically and may be changed at any time by the rating agencies. as a result, we cannot assure stakeholders that we will maintain our current ratings in the future.
rating agencies use an "outlook" statement for both industry sectors and individual companies. for an industry sector, a stable outlook generally implies that over the next 12 to 18 months the rating agency expects ratings to remain unchanged among companies in the sector. this year, a.m. best maintained the rating outlook on the u.s. life insurance industry at negative. fitch and moody's changed the outlook for the u.s. life insurance sector to stable from negative. s&p continued to keep the u.s. life insurance sector on stable outlook. for a particular company, an outlook generally indicates a medium- or long-term trend (generally six months to two years) in credit fundamentals, which if continued, may lead to a rating change. these indicators are not necessarily a precursor of a rating change nor do they preclude a rating agency from changing a rating at any time without notice. fitch, s&p, and a.m. best have all of the company's ratings on stable outlook. moody's has the ratings of prudential financial and its insurance subsidiaries on positive outlook.

the following is a summary of the significant changes or actions in ratings and rating outlooks for our company, as well as for the life insurance industry and sector, that have occurred from january 1, 2017 through the date of this filing:
in may 2017, fitch revised the company outlook for prudential insurance and certain other affiliated insurance companies to stable from negative.
in november 2017, moody's revised its rating outlook on the u.s. life insurance sector to stable from negative. moody's outlook indicates their expectations for the fundamental credit conditions driving the u.s. life insurance industry over the next 12-18 months. the change in the outlook recognizes the sector's resilience in the face of a low interest rate environment, as well as its strong capitalization, aided by strong equity markets and a still expansionary credit cycle.
in november 2017, moody's changed the ratings outlook of prudential financial and its insurance subsidiaries to positive from stable. the positive outlook reflects the company's progress in reducing debt and leverage, improving its financial flexibility, as well as steps taken to reduce earnings volatility and simplify the organizational structure.
in december 2017, fitch revised its sector outlook for u.s. life insurers to stable from negative due to better than expected operating performance and a benign credit environment, which it expects to persist over the near term. at the same time, fitch kept its rating outlook, which indicates the direction in which ratings are likely to move over the next 18 to 24 months, on the u.s. life insurance sector as stable. the current stable outlook reflects fitch's expectations that key credit metrics will remain in line with rating expectations.
requirements to post collateral or make other payments because of ratings downgrades under certain agreements, including derivative agreements, can be satisfied in cash or by posting permissible securities held by the subsidiaries subject to the agreements. in addition, a ratings downgrade by a.m. best to "a-" for our domestic life insurance companies would require prudential insurance to either post collateral or a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $1.4 billion, based on the level of statutory reserves related to the variable annuity business acquired from allstate. we believe that the posting of such collateral would not be a material liquidity event for prudential insurance.
contractual obligations the table below summarizes the future estimated cash payments related to certain contractual obligations as of december 31, 2017. the estimated payments reflected in this table are based on management's estimates and assumptions about these obligations. because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the actual cash outflows in future periods will vary, possibly materially, from those reflected in the table. in addition, we do not believe that our cash flow requirements can be adequately assessed based solely upon an analysis of these obligations, as the table below does not contemplate all aspects of our cash inflows, such as the level of cash flow generated by certain of our investments, nor all aspects of our cash outflows.

__________
(1)   the estimated payments due by period for long-term debt reflects the contractual maturities of principal, as disclosed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, as well as estimated future interest payments. the payment of principal and estimated future interest for short-term debt are reflected in estimated payments due in 2018. the estimate for future interest payments includes the effect of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning our short-term and long-term debt.
(2)   the estimated payments due by period for operating and capital leases reflect the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating and capital leases, as disclosed in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements.
139
(3)   as discussed in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements, we have commitments to purchase or fund investments, some of which are contingent upon events or circumstances not under our control, including those at the discretion of our counterparties. the timing of the fulfillment of certain of these commitments cannot be estimated, therefore the settlements of these obligations are reflected in estimated payments due in less than one year. commitments to purchase or fund investments include $141 million that we anticipate will ultimately be funded from our separate accounts.
(4)   as discussed in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements, loan commitments of our commercial mortgage operations, which are legally binding commitments to extend credit to a counterparty, have been reflected in the contractual obligations table above principally based on the expiration date of the commitment; however, it is possible these loan commitments could be funded prior to their expiration date. in certain circumstances the counterparty may also extend the date of the expiration in exchange for a fee.
(5)   the estimated cash flows due by period for insurance liabilities reflect future estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and others for future policy benefits, policyholders' account balances, policyholder's dividends, reinsurance payables and separate account liabilities, net of premium receipts and reinsurance recoverables. these future estimated cash flows for current policies in force generally reflect our best estimate economic and actuarial assumptions. these cash flows are undiscounted with respect to interest. the sum of the cash flows shown for all years in the table of $1,148 billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of approximately $722 billion included in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31, 2017. separate account liabilities are legally insulated from general account obligations, and it is generally expected these liabilities will be fully funded by separate account assets and their related cash flows. we have made significant assumptions to determine the future estimated cash flows related to the underlying policies and contracts. due to the significance of the assumptions used, actual cash flows will differ, possibly materially, from these estimates.
(6)   the estimated payments due by period for other liabilities includes securities sold under agreements to repurchase, cash collateral for loaned securities, liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, bank customer liabilities, and other miscellaneous liabilities. amounts presented in the table also exclude $1,518 million of notes issued by consolidated vie's which recourse for these obligations is limited to the assets of the respective vie and do not have recourse to the general credit of the company.
we also enter into agreements to purchase goods and services in the normal course of business; however, these purchase obligations are not material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position as of december 31, 2017.
off-balance sheet arrangements guarantees and other contingencies in the course of our business, we provide certain guarantees and indemnities to third parties pursuant to which we may be contingently required to make payments in the future. see "commitments and guarantees" within note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
other contingent commitments we also have other commitments, some of which are contingent upon events or circumstances not under our control, including those at the discretion of our counterparties. see "commitments and guarantees" within note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these commitments. for further discussion of certain of these commitments that relate to our separate accounts, also see "-liquidity associated with other activities-investment management operations."
other off-balance sheet arrangements in 2013, we entered into a put option agreement with a delaware trust that gives prudential financial the right, at any time over a ten-year period, to issue up to $1.5 billion of senior notes to the trust in return for principal and interest strips of u.s. treasury securities that are held by the trust. see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on this put option agreement. in 2014, prudential financial entered into financing transactions, pursuant to which it issued $500 million of limited recourse notes and, in return, obtained $500 million of asset-backed notes from a delaware master trust and ultimately contributed the asset-backed notes to its subsidiary, priac. as of december 31, 2017, no principal payments have been received or are currently due on the asset-backed notes and, as a result, there was no payment obligation under the limited recourse notes. accordingly, none of the notes are reflected in the company's consolidated financial statements as of that date.
other than as described above, we do not have retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities, or variable interests in unconsolidated entities or other similar transactions, arrangements or relationships that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support, that we believe are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or our access to or requirements for capital resources. in addition, other than the agreements referred to above, we do not have relationships with any unconsolidated entities that are contractually limited to narrow activities that facilitate our transfer of or access to associated assets.
risk management overview we employ a risk governance structure, overseen by senior management and our board of directors and managed by enterprise risk management ("erm"), to provide a common framework for evaluating the risks embedded in and across our businesses, developing risk appetites, managing these risks and identifying current and future risk challenges and opportunities. for a discussion of the risks of our businesses, see "risk factors".
140
risk governance framework each of our businesses has a risk governance structure that is supported by a framework at the corporate level. generally, our businesses are authorized to make day-to-day risk decisions that are consistent with enterprise risk policies and limits, and subject to enterprise oversight. our governance structure is comprised of the board and its committees, management committees and erm and is designed to support this framework.
board of directors oversight our board of directors oversees our risk profile and management's processes for assessing and managing risk. the board also reviews strategic risks and opportunities facing the company. certain specific categories of risk are assigned to board committees that report back to the full board, as summarized below:
â€¢   audit committee: oversees insurance risk and operational risks, including model risk, as well as risks related to financial controls, legal, regulatory and compliance risks, and the overall risk management governance structure and risk management function.

management oversight our primary risk management committee is the enterprise risk committee ("erc"). the erc is chaired by our chief risk officer and otherwise comprised of the vice chairman, chief operating officers for the u.s. and international businesses, general counsel, chief financial officer, chief investment officer and chief actuary. our chief auditor also attends meetings of the erc. the erc's mandate is to review significant risks that impact us and approve, or recommend to the board for approval, our risk management policies and limits to keep our risk profile consistent with our strategy.
the erc is supported by six risk oversight committees aligned with our tactical risks, each of which is comprised of subject matter experts and dedicated to one of the following risk types: investment, market, insurance, operational, model and liquidity. these risk oversight committees report their activities to the erc, and significant matters or matters where there are unresolved points of view are reviewed and brought to the erc. the risk oversight committees provide an opportunity to evaluate complex issues by subject matter experts within the various risk areas. they evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of risk mitigation options, identify stakeholders of risks and issues, review material risk assumptions for reasonability and consistency across the company and, working with the different risk areas, develop recommendations for risk limits, among other responsibilities.
each of our business units and significant corporate functions maintains its own risk committee. the business unit risk committees serve as a forum for leaders within each business unit to identify, assess and resolve risk and exposure issues and to review new products and initiatives, prior to such issues being reviewed by the risk oversight committees and/or the erc as appropriate. corporate function risk committees assess and monitor risks associated with performing the relevant corporate functions, set standards and exercise oversight over specific risks.

erm manages a comprehensive framework for assessing the risks embedded in and across our businesses so that the company can manage these risks effectively, evaluate current and future risk challenges and opportunities, and enhance shareholder value. erm operates independently and is responsible for recommending policies, limits and standards for all risks. it oversees these risks under the guidance of the erc and risk oversight committees. additionally, erm works with our business units and corporate areas with an objective of comprehensive identification, monitoring and management of risks that we may face. the erm infrastructure is generally aligned by risk type, with certain groups within erm working across risk types.
risk identification we rely on a combination of activities and processes to provide analysis and seek assurance that all material risks have been identified and managed as appropriate. there are three levels of activities that seek to ensure that changes in risk levels or new risks to the company are identified and escalated as appropriate: (1) business unit activities, (2) corporate function activities, and (3) processes involving senior management and the board of directors.
â€¢   business units: each business area has a risk committee that meets periodically to allow senior leaders to discuss and evaluate current, new, and emerging operational risks in their own operations. business units are required to develop and maintain documented operational risk inventories which facilitate the identification of current operational risk exposures. there is also an emerging risks process that identifies, assesses and monitors potential future risks which could significantly impact the business units or overall company.
â€¢   corporate functions: the corporate functions review the results of the business unit activities and examine risks from an enterprise view across businesses under normal and stressed conditions. as a result, the corporate functions, particularly erm, use several processes and activities used to identify and assess the risks of the company. each corporate function also has its own risk committee.
â€¢   senior management and the board of directors: senior management plays a critical role in reviewing the risk profile of the company, including by identifying impacts to the business strategy of new or changed risks, and risks in any new strategies under consideration. these risks are discussed with the erc as appropriate, and with the board, if significant. as discussed above, the board of directors oversees the company's risk profile and management's processes for assessing and managing risk, both as a full board and through its committees.
risk measurement and monitoring our risk appetite framework ("raf") is a comprehensive process designed to reasonably ensure that all risks taken across the company align with the company's capacity and willingness to take those risks. using common metrics allows for a cohesive assessment of risk, resources and strategy, and supports management and the board in making well-informed business decisions. the company has a comprehensive stress testing framework, which serves as the foundation for the raf. the raf evaluates the company's exposure under various stress metrics and stress severities. the raf provides a dynamic assessment of stress impacts and resources available to absorb these impacts under comprehensive stress scenarios. the company's capital management framework is integrated with the raf to determine the amount of capital the company needs to hold given the risks taken.

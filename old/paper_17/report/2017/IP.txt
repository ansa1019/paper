item 1a. risk factors in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k (particularly in item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations), or in the company's other filings with the securities and exchange commission, the following are some important factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement.
risks relating to industry conditions changes in the cost or availability of raw materials, energy and transportation could affect our profitability. we rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials (principally virgin wood fiber, recycled fiber, caustic soda and starch), energy sources (principally natural gas, coal and fuel oil) and third-party companies that transport our goods. the market price of virgin wood fiber varies based upon availability and source. in addition, the increase in demand of products manufactured, in whole or in part, from recycled fiber, on a global basis, may cause an occasional tightening in the supply of recycled fiber. energy prices, in particular prices for oil and natural gas, have fluctuated dramatically in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future. our profitability has been, and will continue to be, affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials, energy sources and transportation sources.
the industries in which we operate experience both economic cyclicality and changes in consumer preferences. fluctuations in the prices of, and the demand for, our products could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions. the length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product. in addition, changes in consumer preferences may increase or decrease the demand for our products. these consumer preferences affect the prices of our products. consequently, our financial results are sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our products.
competition in the united states and internationally could negatively impact our financial results. we operate in a competitive environment, both in the united states and internationally, in all of our operating segments. product innovations, manufacturing and operating efficiencies, and marketing, distribution and pricing strategies pursued or achieved by competitors could negatively impact our financial results.
risks relating to market and economic factors adverse developments in general business and economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and our financial condition and results of operations. general economic conditions may adversely affect industrial non-durable goods production, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, white-collar employment levels and consumer confidence, all of which impact demand for our products. in addition, volatility in the capital and credit markets, which impacts interest rates, currency exchange rates and the availability of credit, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and our results of operations.
the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business. as of december 31, 2017, international paper had approximately $11.2 billion of outstanding indebtedness. the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial condition, operating results and business, including the following:
•   it may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, dividends, share repurchases, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;
•   a portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to payments on indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes, including
7
operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;
•   the debt service requirements of our indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy other obligations;
•   our indebtedness that is subject to variable rates of interest exposes us to increased debt service obligations in the event of increased interest rates;
•   it may limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and
•   it may increase our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business, and may make us unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth.
in addition, we are subject to agreements that require meeting and maintaining certain financial ratios and covenants. a significant or prolonged downturn in general business and economic conditions may affect our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our current business objectives.
changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. maintaining an investment-grade credit rating is an important element of our financial strategy, and a downgrade of the company's ratings below investment grade may limit our access to the capital markets, have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities, increase our cost of borrowing and require us to post collateral for derivatives in a net liability position. the company's desire to maintain its investment grade rating may cause the company to take certain actions designed to improve its cash flow, including sale of assets, suspension or reduction of our dividend and reductions in capital expenditures and working capital.
under the terms of the agreements governing approximately $1.4 billion of our debt as of december 31, 2017, the applicable interest rate on such debt may increase upon each downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade. as a result, a downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade may lead to an increase in our interest expense. there can be no assurance that such credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in each rating agency's judgment, circumstances so warrant. any such downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of borrowing, limit our access to the capital markets or result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur.
downgrades in the credit ratings of banks issuing certain letters of credit will increase our cost of maintaining certain indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of deferred taxes. we are subject to the risk that a bank with currently issued irrevocable letters of credit supporting installment notes delivered to temple-inland in connection with temple-inland's 2007 sales of forestlands may be downgraded below a required rating. since 2007, certain banks have fallen below the required ratings threshold and were successfully replaced, or waivers were obtained regarding their replacement. as a result of continuing uncertainty in the banking environment, a number of the letter-of-credit banks currently in place remain subject to risk of downgrade and the number of qualified replacement banks remains limited. the downgrade of one or more of these banks may subject the company to additional costs of securing a replacement letter-of-credit bank or could result in an acceleration of payments of up to $538 million in deferred income taxes if replacement banks cannot be obtained. the deferred taxes are currently recorded in the company's consolidated financial statements. see note 12, variable interest entities, on pages 63 through 64, and note 10, income taxes, on pages 57 through 60, in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information.
our pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors which could cause these costs to change. we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all u.s. salaried employees hired prior to july 1, 2004 and substantially all hourly and union employees regardless of hire date. we provide retiree health care benefits to certain former u.s. hourly employees, as well as financial assistance towards the cost of individual retiree medical coverage for certain former u.s. salaried employees. our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. fluctuations in actual equity market returns, changes in general interest rates and changes in the number of retirees may result in increased pension costs in future periods. likewise, changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could increase pension costs.
our pension plans are currently underfunded, and over time we may be
8
required to make cash payments to the plans, reducing the cash available for our business. we record a liability associated with our pension plans equal to the excess of the benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets. the benefit liability recorded under the provisions of accounting standards codification (asc) 715, "compensation - retirement benefits," at december 31, 2017 was $2.0 billion. the amount and timing of future contributions will depend upon a number of factors, including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates.
changes in international conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations. our operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to the countries outside the united states in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products. specifically, russia, brazil, poland, india, and turkey, where we have substantial manufacturing facilities, are countries that are exposed to economic and political instability in their respective regions of the world. fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the u.s. dollar, downturns in economic activity, adverse tax consequences, nationalization or any change in social, political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions could negatively affect our financial results. trade protection measures in favor of local producers of competing products, including governmental subsidies, tax benefits and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over international paper, may also adversely impact our operating results and business prospects in these countries. likewise, disruption in existing trade agreements (e.g., nafta) or increased trade friction between countries (e.g., the u.s. and china) could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations by restricting the free flow of goods and services across borders. in addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under u.s. law and other laws related to operations in foreign jurisdictions. for example, the foreign corrupt practices act prohibits u.s. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad. failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions and the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations.
risks relating to legal proceedings and compliance costs we are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and other government requirements that may change in significant ways, and the cost of compliance with such requirements could impact our business and results of operations. our operations are subject to regulation under a wide variety of u.s. federal and state and non-u.s. laws, regulations and other government requirements -- including, among others, those relating to the environment, health and safety, labor and employment, data privacy, tax and health care. there can be no assurance that laws, regulations and government requirements will not be changed, applied or interpreted in ways that will require us to modify our operations and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs.
for example, we have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant capital, operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations. there can be no assurance that future remediation requirements and compliance with existing and new laws and requirements, including with global climate change laws and regulations, will not require significant expenditures, or that existing reserves for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs. we could also incur substantial fines or sanctions, enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures), natural resource damages claims, cleanup and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws, regulations, codes and common law. the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict, and, in some cases, liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of hazardous substances.
as another example, we are subject to a number of labor and employment laws and regulations that could significantly increase our operating costs and reduce our operational flexibility. additionally, changing privacy laws in the united states, europe and elsewhere, including the adoption of the european union of the general data protection regulation (gdpr), which will become effective may 2018, creates new individual privacy rights and imposes increased obligations on companies handling personal data. compliance with the stringent rules under gdpr will require an extensive review of our global data processing systems, which is ongoing. a failure to comply with gdpr could result in fines up to 20 million euros or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is higher.

as a final example, in december 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act"). the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the u.s. tax code. for a discussion of the immediate and potential impacts to the company of the tax act and the uncertainties around the company's current estimates of such impacts, see note 10, income taxes.
results of legal proceedings could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. the costs and other effects of pending litigation against us cannot be determined with certainty. although we do not believe that the outcome of any pending or threatened lawsuits or claims will have a material effect on our business or consolidated financial statements, there can be no assurance that the outcome of any lawsuit or claim will be as expected.
risks relating to our operations material disruptions at one of our manufacturing facilities could negatively impact our financial results. we operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities. a material disruption at our corporate headquarters or one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and/or negatively impact our financial condition. any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:
•   fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other catastrophes;
•   the effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on its water supply;
•   the effect of other severe weather conditions on equipment and facilities;
•   terrorism or threats of terrorism;
•   domestic and international laws and regulations applicable to our company and our business partners, including joint venture partners, around the world;
•   unscheduled maintenance outages;
•   prolonged power failures;
•   an equipment failure;
•   a chemical spill or release;
•   explosion of a boiler or other equipment;
•   damage or disruptions caused by third parties operating on or adjacent to one of our manufacturing facilities;
•   disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, railroad tracks and tunnels;
•   widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis;
•   labor difficulties; and
•   other operational problems.
any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products and/or require us to make unplanned expenditures. if one of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime, our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer requirements could be impaired, resulting in lower sales and having a negative effect on our business and financial results.
we are subject to information technology risks related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive company, customer, employee and vendor information as well as breaches in the technology used to manage operations and other business processes. our business operations rely upon secure information technology systems for data capture, processing, storage and reporting. despite careful security and controls design, implementation, updating and independent third party verification, our information technology systems, and those of our third party providers, could become subject to employee error or malfeasance, cyber attacks, or natural disasters. network, system, application and data breaches could result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation including, but not limited to, interruption to systems availability, denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with international paper. access to internal applications required to plan our operations, source materials, manufacture and ship finished goods and account for orders could be denied or misused. theft of intellectual property or trade secrets, and inappropriate disclosure of confidential company, employee, customer or vendor information, could stem from such incidents. any of these operational disruptions and/or misappropriation of information could result in lost sales, business delays, negative publicity and could have a material effect on our business.

certain operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit. certain operations in russia are carried on by a joint venture, ilim. in joint ventures, we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do. in general, joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions. in joint ventures, we are required to pay more attention to our relationship with our co-owners as well as with the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes, our relationship may be adversely affected. in addition, the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, so we receive only our portion of those benefits.
we may not achieve the expected benefits from acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures and other corporate transactions. our strategy for long-term growth, productivity and profitability depends, in part, on our ability to accomplish prudent acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures and other corporate transactions and to realize the benefits we expect from such transactions, and we are subject to the risk that we may not achieve the expected benefits. among the benefits we expect from potential as well as completed acquisitions and joint ventures are synergies, cost savings, growth opportunities or access to new markets (or a combination thereof), and in the case of divestitures, the realization of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets to purchasers who place higher strategic value on such businesses and assets than does international paper.
on january 1, 2018, for example, we completed a transaction transferring our north american consumer packaging business to graphic packaging in exchange for, among other things, an equity interest in the combined business of 20.5%, as of immediately following the closing, and the assumption by the combined business of $660 million of indebtedness that we incurred prior to closing of the transaction. the success of the transaction will depend, in part, on the financial performance of the combined business and on the ability of the combined business to realize anticipated growth opportunities, cost savings and other synergies. the success of the combined business in realizing these growth opportunities, cost savings and other synergies, and the timing of this realization, will depend on the successful integration of our north american consumer packaging business with graphic packaging's business.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary international paper delivered a year of strong performance in 2017, driven by excellent commercial execution across our businesses. our global cellulose fibers business is on track to achieve the estimated transaction synergies. we continued to grow value for our shareholders with our return on invested capital solidly exceeding our cost of capital for the eighth consecutive year. we made substantial progress in further strengthening our portfolio during 2017. we accelerated strategic investments for growth in the industrial packaging business, providing the company with the flexibility we need around capacity, products and geography to support our customers. in addition, the company made an important strategic move to transfer the north american consumer packaging business, which included the north american coated paperboard and foodservice businesses, to a subsidiary of graphic packaging holding company. this strategic move enables us to focus on growing value in our core businesses and establish a 20.5% ownership interest in the subsidiary of graphic packaging holding company that holds the assets of the combined business. finally, we generated strong free cash flow which enabled us to increase our annual dividend for the sixth consecutive year.
our 2017 results reflect significant pricing and mix improvement, which accelerated throughout the year. the improvement in price and mix was primarily driven by price realization on price increases announced in prior quarters in our north american industrial packaging and global cellulose fibers businesses. operations were negatively impacted by hurricanes and the pensacola event earlier in the year; however, 2017 was a lower maintenance outage year. input costs were higher compared to 2016, driven by significantly higher recovered fiber costs, as well as, higher energy and transportation costs during the latter part of the year. our ilim joint venture delivered solid operational and financial results, driven by pricing and strong volume, and provided more than $130 million in cash dividends to international paper in 2017. finally, our 2017 results reflect the provisional net tax benefit associated with the impact of the december 2017 enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act.
looking ahead to the 2018 first quarter, overall industry conditions are expected to remain strong, and we should continue to benefit from announced price increases, cost reduction initiatives and additional synergies. we expect higher export price realization in our north american industrial packaging business and improved pricing in our printing papers segment, as price increases implemented in 2017 are realized. we also expect 2018 first quarter sales volumes for north american industrial packaging and brazil papers to be down due to seasonally lower demand. our north american mill operations have been affected by the severe cold weather experienced at the beginning of 2018 which is expected to impact operating costs. costs will be higher in our european packaging business related to the madrid mill conversion. in addition, planned maintenance outages are expected to increase due to a heavy outage quarter, as 70% of the company outages are planned during the first half of 2018. input costs are expected to increase across our businesses, driven by higher wood, energy and transportation costs. additionally, we expect equity earnings for ilim to be sequentially higher, driven by price realization across the pulp portfolio which will be partly offset by seasonally lower volumes.
looking to full year 2018, our focus will be on value creation in our growth businesses. we anticipate another year of strong growth, driven by a continued strong outlook in our core businesses and the full-year price flow through of the 2017 increases. we continue to see healthy demand and solid fundamentals across our portfolio. we expect higher maintenance outage expenses due to the calendar impact of mills on an eighteen-month cycle and extended outages at several of our mills, as we position them for longer maintenance cycle schedules in the future. we are planning for $1.5 billion in capital expenditures in 2018, including approximately $500 million that will be invested in strategic projects, including the madrid mill conversion and the riverdale conversion. also, we will see the positive cash tax impact associated with tax reform. our ilim joint venture is well positioned for another strong year of performance, and we will start to see the benefits of our investment in graphic packaging. all in, we expect another year of strong cash generation enabling us to continue to allocate capital to grow value for our shareholders.
adjusted operating earnings and adjusted operating earnings per share are non-gaap measures and are defined as net earnings from continuing operations (a gaap measure) excluding special items and non-operating pension expense. diluted earnings (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to common shareholders are the most direct comparable gaap measures. the company calculates adjusted operating earnings by excluding the after-tax effect of items considered by management to be unusual, from the earnings reported under gaap, non-operating pension expense (includes all u.s. pension costs, excluding service costs and prior service costs), and discontinued operations. adjusted operating earnings per share is calculated by dividing adjusted operating earnings by diluted average shares of common stock outstanding. management uses this measure to focus on on-going operations, and believes that it is useful to investors
17
because it enables them to perform meaningful comparisons of past and present operating results. the company believes that using this information, along with the most direct comparable gaap measure, provides for a more complete analysis of the results of operations.
the following are reconciliations of diluted earnings (loss) attributable to common shareholders to adjusted operating earnings attributable to common shareholders.

free cash flow is a non-gaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure is cash provided by operations. management believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures the amount of cash generated that is available, after reinvesting in the business, to maintain a strong balance sheet, pay dividends, repurchase stock, repay debt and make investments for future growth. it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. by adjusting for certain items that are not indicative of the company's ongoing performance, free cash flow also enables
18
investors to perform meaningful comparisons between past and present periods.
the company generated free cash flow of approximately $2.0 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the following are reconciliations of free cash flow to cash provided by operations:

results of operations business segment operating profits are used by international paper's management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses. management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs, operating efficiencies, prices and volumes. business segment operating profits are defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity earnings, but including the impact of equity earnings and noncontrolling interests, excluding corporate items and corporate special items. business segment operating profits are defined by the securities and exchange commission as a non-gaap financial measure, and are not gaap alternatives to net income or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states.
international paper operates in three segments: industrial packaging, global cellulose fibers and printing papers. during 2017, as a result of the transfer of the north american coated paperboard business and the associated reclassification of this business to discontinued operations, the remaining sales and operating profits previously reported in the consumer packaging segment have been reclassified for segment reporting for all periods presented. the european coated paperboard business is now included in the industrial packaging segment and sales and earnings historically included in the consumer packaging segment associated with previously divested businesses are now included in corporate items.

business segment operating profits in 2017 included a net loss from special items of $425 million compared with $127 million in 2016 and $137 million in 2015. operationally, compared with 2016, the benefits from higher average sales price realizations and mix ($605 million), higher sales volumes ($33 million), lower maintenance outage costs ($55 million) and the incremental operating earnings from the pulp business acquired in late 2016 ($117 million) were offset by higher operating costs ($172 million), higher input costs ($362 million) and higher other costs ($11 million).
corporate items includes operating profits (losses) of previously divested businesses of $0 million in 2017, ($2) million in 2016 and ($62) million in 2015.
19
the principal changes in operating profit by business segment were as follows:
•   industrial packaging's profits of $1.5 billion were $194 million lower than in 2016 as the benefits of higher average sales price realizations and mix and higher sales volumes were partially offset by higher operating costs, higher maintenance outage costs, higher input costs and higher other costs. in addition, operating profits in 2017 included a charge of $354 million related to the agreement to settle the kleen products anti-trust class action lawsuit, charges of $14 million for the removal of abandoned property at our mills, a charge of $10 million for the accelerated amortization of an intangible asset in brazil and a gain of $6 million for a net bargain purchase gain associated with the 2016 acquisition of holmen paper's newsprint mill in madrid, spain. in 2016, operating profits included a charge of $70 million for impairment and other costs associated with the sale of our corrugated packaging business in asia and a charge of $7 million related to the closure of a mill in turkey.
•   global cellulose fibers' operating profit of $65 million was $244 million favorable versus 2016 as the benefits of higher average sales price realizations and mix, lower operating costs, lower maintenance outage costs and lower input costs were partially offset by higher other costs. operating profits in 2017 included $33 million of costs associated with the acquisition and integration of the pulp business acquired in late 2016 from weyerhaeuser, a charge of $14 million for the amortization of the remaining inventory fair value adjustment associated with that acquisition and a charge of $4 million for the removal of abandoned property at our mills. results for 2017 also reflect the transaction synergies associated with the weyerhaeuser acquisition. in 2016, the operating loss included $31 million of costs associated with the acquisition of the pulp business and $19 million for the amortization of the inventory fair value adjustment associated with that acquisition.
•   printing papers' profits of $457 million represented a $83 million decrease in operating profits from 2016. the benefits from higher sales volumes, lower maintenance outage costs and lower other costs were more than offset by lower average sales price realizations and mix, higher operating costs and higher input costs. operating profits in 2017 included charges of $2 million for the removal of abandoned property at our mills.
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december 31, 2017, international paper generated $1.8 billion of cash flow from operations compared with $2.5 billion in 2016 and $2.6 billion in 2015. cash flow from operations included $1.25 billion, $750 million and $750 million of cash pension contributions in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. capital spending for 2017 totaled $1.4 billion, or 98% of depreciation and amortization expense. our liquidity position remains strong, supported by approximately $2.1 billion of credit facilities that we believe are adequate to meet future liquidity requirements. maintaining an investment-grade credit rating for our long-term debt continues to be an important element in our overall financial strategy.
we expect strong cash generation again in 2018, including the benefits of u.s. tax reform, and will continue our balanced use of cash through the payment of dividends, reducing total debt and making investments for future growth.
capital spending for 2018 is targeted at $1.5 billion, or about 111% of depreciation and amortization.

results of operations while the operating results for international paper's various business segments are driven by a number of business-specific factors, changes in international paper's operating results are closely tied to changes in general economic conditions in north america, europe, russia, latin america, india, north africa and the middle east. factors that impact the demand for our products include industrial non-durable goods production, consumer spending, commercial printing and advertising activity, white-collar employment levels, and movements in currency exchange rates.
product prices are affected by general economic trends, inventory levels, currency exchange rate movements and
20
worldwide capacity utilization. in addition to these revenue-related factors, net earnings are impacted by various cost drivers, the more significant of which include changes in raw material costs, principally wood, recycled fiber and chemical costs; energy costs; freight costs; salary and benefits costs, including pensions; and manufacturing conversion costs.
the following is a discussion of international paper's results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2017, and the major factors affecting these results compared to 2016 and 2015.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, international paper reported net sales of $21.7 billion, compared with $19.5 billion in 2016 and $20.7 billion in 2015. international net sales (including u.s. exports) totaled $8.4 billion or 39% of total sales in 2017. this compares with international net sales of $6.9 billion in 2016 and $7.6 billion in 2015.
full year 2017 net earnings attributable to international paper company totaled $2.1 billion ($5.13 per diluted share), compared with net earnings of $904 million ($2.18 per diluted share) in 2016 and $938 million ($2.23 per diluted share) in 2015. amounts in all periods include the results of discontinued operations.
earnings from continuing operations attributable to international paper company after taxes in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:

(a) includes $952 million of net special items income which included a provisional net tax benefit of $1.2 billion related to the enactment of the tax cut and jobs act and $298 million of non-operating pension expense which included a pre-tax charge of $376 million ($232 million after taxes) for a settlement accounting charge associated with an annuity purchase and transfer of pension obligations for approximately 45,000 retirees.
(b) includes $108 million of net special items charges and $375 million of non-operating pension expense which included a pre-tax charge of $439 million ($270 million after taxes) for a settlement accounting charge associated with payments under a term-vested lump sum buyout.
(c) includes $439 million of net special items charges and $157 million of non-operating pension expense.
compared with 2016, the benefits from higher sales volumes, higher average sales price realizations and mix, lower maintenance outage costs, incremental earnings from the acquisition of weyerhaeuser's pulp business, lower other costs, and lower tax expense were partially offset by higher operating costs, higher input costs and higher net interest expense. in addition, 2017 results included lower equity earnings, net of taxes, relating to the company's investment in ilim holding, sa.
see business segment results on pages 24 through 27 for a discussion of the impact of these factors by segment.
discontinued operations
2017:
on january 1, 2018, the company completed the transfer of its north american consumer packaging business, which includes its north american coated paperboard and foodservice businesses, to a subsidiary of graphic packaging holding company. international paper received a 20.5% ownership interest in a subsidiary of graphic packaging holding company that holds the assets of the combined business. as a result of this transfer, all current and prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the north american consumer packaging business as a discontinued operation. see note 7 on pages 53 through 55 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion.
included in discontinued operations were the operating earnings of the north american consumer packaging business, an after-tax charge of $10 million for costs associated with the transfer and an after-tax charge of $28 million for non-operating pension expenses related to curtailment charges and termination benefits in connection with this same transaction.
2016:
in 2016, discontinued operations included the operating earnings of the north american consumer packaging business and an after-tax charge of $5 million expense associated with a legal settlement related to the xpedx business.
2015:
in 2015, discontinued operations included the operating earnings of the north american consumer packaging business.

income taxes a net income tax benefit of $1.1 billion was recorded for 2017, including a provisional net tax benefit of $1.2 billion related to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act, tax benefits of $113 million related to income tax refund claims, a tax expense of $9 million related to an international tax law change, tax expenses of $34 million related to international investment restructuring and a tax expense of $38 million associated with a cash pension contribution. excluding these items, a $194 million net tax benefit for other special items and a $186 million tax benefit related to non-operating pension expense, the tax provision was $549 million, or 30% of pre-tax earnings before equity earnings.
a net income tax provision of $193 million was recorded for 2016 including tax benefits of $63 million related to legal entity restructurings, a tax expense of $31 million associated with a tax rate change in luxembourg, a tax expense of $23 million associated with a $750 million cash pension contribution, and a tax benefit of $14 million related to the closure of a federal tax audit. excluding these items, a $51 million tax benefit for other special items and a $235 million tax benefit related to non-operating pension expense, the tax provision was $502 million, or 32% of pre-tax earnings before equity earnings.
a net income tax provision of $417 million was recorded for 2015 including a tax benefit of $62 million related to internal restructurings, a tax expense of $23 million for the tax impact of a cash pension contribution of $750 million and a $2 million tax expense for other items. excluding these items, an $83 million net tax benefit for other special items and a $101 million tax benefit related to non-operating pension expense, the tax provision was $638 million, or 33% of pre-tax earnings before equity earnings.
equity earnings, net of taxes equity earnings, net of taxes in 2017, 2016 and 2015 consisted principally of the company's share of earnings from its 50% investment in ilim holding s.a. in russia (see page 27).
interest expense and noncontrolling interest net corporate interest expense totaled $572 million in 2017, $520 million in 2016 and $555 million in 2015. net interest expense in 2017 includes $5 million of interest income associated with income tax refund claims. the increase in 2017 compared with 2016 is due to higher average outstanding debt. the decrease in 2016 compared with 2015 reflects lower average interest rates.
there were no net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2017, compared with a loss of $2 million in 2016 and a loss of $21 million in 2015. the decrease from 2015 reflects the sale of our equity share of the ip-sun jv in 2015.
special items restructuring and other charges international paper continually evaluates its operations for improvement opportunities targeted to (a) focus our portfolio on our core businesses, (b) realign capacity to operate fewer facilities with the same revenue capability and close high cost facilities, and (c) reduce costs. annually, strategic operating plans are developed by each of our businesses. if it subsequently becomes apparent that a facility's plan will not be achieved, a decision is then made to, among other outcomes, (a) invest additional capital to upgrade the facility, (b) shut down the facility and record the corresponding charge, or (c) evaluate the expected recovery of the carrying value of the facility to determine if an impairment of the assets have occurred. in recent years, this policy has led to the shutdown of a number of facilities and the recording of significant asset impairment charges and severance costs. it is possible that additional charges and costs will be incurred in future periods in our core businesses should such triggering events occur.
during 2017, 2016 and 2015, pre-tax restructuring and other charges totaling $67 million, $54 million and $252 million were recorded. details of these charges are as follows:

liquidity and capital resources overview a major factor in international paper's liquidity and capital resource planning is its generation of operating cash flow, which is highly sensitive to changes in the pricing and demand for our major products. while changes in key cash operating costs, such as energy, raw material and transportation costs, do have an effect on operating cash generation, we believe that our focus on pricing and cost controls has improved our cash flow generation over an operating cycle.
cash uses during 2017 were primarily focused on working capital requirements, capital spending, debt reductions, pension contributions, and returning cash to shareholders.

cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operations, including discontinued operations, totaled $1.8 billion in 2017 compared with $2.5 billion for 2016 and $2.6 billion for 2015. cash used by working capital components (accounts receivable and inventory less accounts payable and accrued liabilities, interest payable and other) totaled $402 million in 2017, compared with cash provided by working capital components of $71 million in 2016 and a cash use for working capital components of $222 million in 2015. the increase in 2017 working capital is largely due to growth in receivables primarily tied to year-over-year price increases.
investment activities including discontinued operations, investment activities in 2017 decreased from 2016 as 2016 included the purchase of weyerhaeuser's pulp business for $2.2 billion in cash, the purchase of the holmen business for $57 million in cash, net of cash acquired, and proceeds from the sale of the asia packaging business of $108 million, net of cash divested. in 2015, investment activity includes higher capital spending and the use of $198 million of cash in conjunction with the timber monetization restructuring (see note 12 variable interest entities and preferred securities of subsidiaries on pages 63 through 64 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data). the company maintains an average capital spending target around depreciation and amortization levels or modestly above due to strategic plans over the course of an economic cycle. capital spending was $1.4 billion in 2017, or 98% of depreciation and amortization, compared with $1.3 billion in 2016, or 110% of depreciation and amortization, and $1.5 billion, or 115% of depreciation and amortization in 2015. across our businesses, capital spending as a percentage of depreciation and amortization ranged from 37.5% to 107.0% in 2017.

(b)   includes $1.6 billion relating to fiber supply agreements entered into at the time of the 2006 transformation plan forestland sales and in conjunction with the 2008 acquisition of weyerhaeuser company's containerboard, packaging and recycling business. also includes $1.2 billion relating to fiber supply agreements assumed in conjunction with the 2016 acquisition of weyerhaeuser's pulp business.
(c)   not included in the above table due to the uncertainty of the amount and timing of the payment are unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $134 million.
we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31, 2017, to be permanently reinvested and, accordingly, no u.s. income taxes have been provided thereon. as a result of recent u.s. tax legislation, the company is evaluating this assertion (see note 10 income taxes on pages 57 through 60 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data). as of december 31, 2017, the amount of cash associated with permanently reinvested foreign earnings was approximately $590 million. we do not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the united states to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements.
pension obligations and funding at december 31, 2017, the projected benefit obligation for the company's u.s. defined benefit plans determined under u.s. gaap was approximately $1.9 billion higher than the fair value of plan assets. approximately $1.5 billion of this amount relates to plans that are subject to minimum funding requirements. under current irs funding rules, the calculation of minimum funding requirements differs from the calculation of the present value of plan benefits(the projected benefit obligation) for accounting purposes. in december 2008, the worker, retiree and employer recovery act of 2008 (wera) was passed by the u.s. congress which provided for pension funding relief and technical corrections. funding contributions depend on the funding method selected by the company, and the timing of its implementation, as
30
well as on actual demographic data and the targeted funding level. the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and elected to make contributions totaling $1,250 million and $750 million for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. at this time, we do not expect to have any required contributions to our plans in 2018, although the company may elect to make future voluntary contributions. the timing and amount of future contributions, which could be material, will depend on a number of factors, including the actual earnings and changes in values of plan assets and changes in interest rates.
during the fourth quarter of 2017, the company entered into an agreement with the prudential insurance company of america to purchase a group annuity contract and transfer approximately $1.3 billion of international paper's u.s. qualified pension plan projected benefit obligations. the transaction closed on october 3, 2017 and was funded with pension plan assets. under the transaction, at the end of 2017, prudential assumed responsibility for pension benefits and annuity administration for approximately 45,000 retirees or their beneficiaries receiving less than $450 in monthly benefit payments from the plan. settlement accounting rules required a remeasurement of the qualified plan as of october 3, 2017 and the company recognized a non-cash pension settlement charge of $376 million before tax in the fourth quarter of 2017. in addition, large payments from the non-qualified pension plan also required a remeasurement as of october 2, 2017 and a non-cash settlement charge of $7 million was also recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017.
during the first quarter of 2016, international paper announced a voluntary, limited-time opportunity for former employees who are participants in the retirement plan of international paper company (the pension plan) to request early payment of their entire pension plan benefit in the form of a single lump sum payment. the amount of total payments under this program was approximately $1.2 billion, and were made from plan trust assets on june 30, 2016. based on the level of payments made, settlement accounting rules applied and resulted in a plan remeasurement as of the june 30, 2016 payment date. as a result of settlement accounting, the company recognized a pro-rata portion of the unamortized net actuarial loss, after remeasurement, resulting in a $439 million non-cash charge to the company's earnings in the second quarter of 2016. additional payments of $8 million and $9 million were made during the third and fourth quarters, respectively, due to mandatory cash payouts and a small lump sum payout, and the pension plan was subsequently remeasured at september 30, 2016 and december 31, 2016. as a result of settlement accounting, the company recognized non-cash settlement charges of $3 million in both the third and fourth quarters of 2016.
ilim holding s.a. shareholder's agreement in october 2007, in connection with the formation of the ilim holding s.a. joint venture, international paper entered into a shareholder's agreement that includes provisions relating to the reconciliation of disputes among the partners. this agreement provides that at any time, either the company or its partners may commence procedures specified under the deadlock agreement. if these or any other deadlock procedures under the shareholder's agreement are commenced, although it is not obligated to do so, the company may in certain situations choose to purchase its partners' 50% interest in ilim. any such transaction would be subject to review and approval by russian and other relevant anti-trust authorities. based on the provisions of the agreement, the company estimates that the current purchase price for its partners' 50% interests would be approximately $1.5 billion, which could be satisfied by payment of cash or international paper common stock, or some combination of the two, at the company's option. the purchase by the company of its partners' 50% interest in ilim would result in the consolidation of ilim's financial position and results of operations in all subsequent periods. the parties have informed each other that they have no current intention to commence procedures specified under the deadlock provisions of the shareholder's agreement.
critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires international paper to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain.
accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of international paper, and that can require judgments by management that affect their application, include the accounting for contingencies, impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and goodwill, pensions and postretirement benefit obligations, stock options and income taxes. the company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of significant estimates with the audit and finance committee of the company's board of directors.
contingent liabilities accruals for contingent liabilities, including legal, and environmental matters, are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. liabilities accrued for legal matters require judgments
31
regarding projected outcomes and range of loss based on historical experience and recommendations of legal counsel. liabilities for environmental matters require evaluations of relevant environmental regulations and estimates of future remediation alternatives and costs.
we calculate our workers' compensation reserves based on estimated actuarially calculated development factors. the workers' compensation reserves are reviewed at least quarterly to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related financial statement disclosure. while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, the ultimate settlement of workers' compensation reserves may differ significantly from amounts we have accrued in our consolidated financial statements.
impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill an impairment of a long-lived asset exists when the asset's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, and is recorded when the carrying amount is not recoverable through cash flows from future operations. a goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. assessments of possible impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill are made when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable through future operations. additionally, testing for possible impairment of goodwill and intangible asset balances is required annually. the amount and timing of any impairment charges based on these assessments require the estimation of future cash flows and the fair market value of the related assets based on management's best estimates of certain key factors, including future selling prices and volumes, operating, raw material, energy and freight costs, and various other projected operating economic factors. as these key factors change in future periods, the company will update its impairment analyses to reflect its latest estimates and projections.
asu 2011-08, "intangibles - goodwill and other," allows entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative ("step 0") assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit for the goodwill impairment test. if a step 0 assessment is performed, an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that, based on that step 0 assessment, it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying value.
the company performed its annual testing of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairments by applying the qualitative step 0 analysis to its reporting units as of october 1, 2017. for the current year test, the company assessed various assumptions, events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting units. the results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of the company's reporting units were less than the carrying values of the reporting units.
in addition, the company considered whether there were any events or circumstances subsequent to the annual test that would reduce the fair value of its reporting units below their carrying amounts and necessitate another goodwill impairment test. in consideration of all relevant factors, there were no indicators that would require goodwill impairment subsequent to october 1, 2017.
no goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2017 or 2016.
in the fourth quarter of 2015, in conjunction with the annual testing of its reporting units for goodwill impairment, the company calculated the estimated fair value of its brazil packaging business using the discounted future cash flows and determined that all of the goodwill in the business, totaling $137 million, should be written off. the decline in the fair value of the brazil packaging business and resulting impairment charge was due to the negative impacts on the cash flows of the business caused by the continued decline of the overall brazilian economy.
pension and postretirement benefit obligations the charges recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are determined annually in conjunction with international paper's consulting actuary, and are dependent upon various assumptions including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates, projected future compensation increases, health care cost trend rates and mortality rates.
the calculations of pension and postretirement benefit obligations and expenses require decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities, the projected rate of future compensation increases and health care cost trend rates.
benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets as of december 31, 2017, for international paper's pension and postretirement plans were as follows:
in millions                         benefit   fair value of obligation   plan assets u.s. qualified pension        $12,895         $11,368
u.s. nonqualified pension         369         -
u.s. postretirement               270         -
non-u.s. pension                  247                 176
non-u.s. postretirement            25         -

the table below shows assumptions used by international paper to calculate u.s. pension obligations for the years shown:
2017                                            2016        2015

rate of compensation increase   3.75   %   3.75   %    3.75   %
additionally, health care cost trend rates and other assumptions used in the calculation of u.s. postretirement obligations for the years shown were:
2017                                                                           2016

health care cost trend rate assumed for next year             6.50   %    6.50    %
rate that the cost trend rate gradually declines to           5.00   %    5.00    %
year that the rate reaches the rate it is assumed to remain   2022   2022
international paper determines these actuarial assumptions, after consultation with our actuaries, on december 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year. the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plan's investment portfolio. the discount rate assumption was determined based on a hypothetical settlement portfolio selected from a universe of high quality corporate bonds.
the expected long-term rate of return on u.s. pension plan assets used to determine net periodic cost for the year ended december 31, 2017 was 7.50%.
increasing (decreasing) the expected long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets by an additional 0.25% would decrease (increase) 2018 pension expense by approximately $27 million, while a (decrease) increase of 0.25% in the discount rate would (increase) decrease pension expense by approximately $35 million. the effect on net postretirement benefit cost from a 1% increase or decrease in the annual health care cost trend rate would be approximately $1 million.
actual rates of return earned on u.s. pension plan assets for each of the last 10 years were:
year       return   year        return
2017   19.3   %     2012    14.1   %
2016    7.1   %     2011     2.5   %
2015    1.3   %     2010    15.1   %
2014    6.4   %     2009    23.8   %
2013   14.1   %     2008   (23.6   )%
the 2012, 2013 and 2014 returns above represent weighted averages of international paper and temple-inland asset returns. international paper and temple-
inland assets were combined in october 2014. the annualized time-weighted rate of return earned on u.s. pension plan assets was 9.4% and 7.2% for the past five and ten years, respectively. the following graph shows the growth of a $1,000 investment in international paper's u.s. pension plan master trust. the graph portrays the time-weighted rate of return from 2007 - 2017.
asc 715, "compensation - retirement benefits," provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses, including amounts arising from changes in the estimated projected plan benefit obligation due to changes in the assumed discount rate, differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets, and other assumption changes. these net gains and losses are recognized in pension expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans to the extent that they are not offset by gains and losses in subsequent years. the estimated net loss and prior service cost that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost for the u.s. pension plans over the next fiscal year are $327 million and $17 million, respectively.
net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses, calculated for all of international paper's plans, were as follows:
in millions                 2017          2016           2015           2014           2013
pension expense u.s. plans (non-cash)       $717          $809           $461           $387           $545
non-u.s. plans                 5             4              6              -              5
postretirement expense u.s. plans                    17            13              8              7             (1   )
non-u.s. plans                 1             1              5              7              7
net expense                 $740          $827           $480           $401           $556
the decrease in 2017 u.s. pension expense reflects lower settlement losses and lower actuarial losses partially offset by lower asset returns due to the annuity purchase as well as curtailment and special termination benefit charges.

assuming that discount rates, expected long-term returns on plan assets and rates of future compensation increases remain the same as of december 31, 2017, projected future net periodic pension and postretirement plan expenses would be as follows:
in millions                   2019          2018
pension expense u.s. plans (non-cash)      $30          $167
non-u.s. plans               5             4
postretirement expense u.s. plans                  14            16
non-u.s. plans               1             1
net expense                $50          $188
the company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately $167 million for its u.s. defined benefit plans in 2018, compared to expense of $717 million in 2017. the 2017 expense includes $45 million of curtailment and special pension benefits associated with the north american consumer packaging business and $383 million of settlement accounting charges. excluding these settlement charges and curtailment and special pension benefits, the estimated decrease in net pension expense in 2018 is primarily due to lower interest cost on the reduced pension obligation and a higher expected return on assets associated with the increased pension asset balance.
the market value of plan assets for international paper's u.s. qualified pension plan at december 31, 2017 totaled approximately $11.4 billion, consisting of approximately 49% equity securities, 36% debt securities, 10% real estate and 5% other assets.
the company's funding policy for its qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements, plus any additional amounts that the company may determine to be appropriate considering the funded status of the plan, tax deductibility, the cash flows generated by the company, and other factors. the company continually reassesses the amount and timing of any discretionary contributions and could elect to make voluntary contributions in the future. there are no required contributions to the u.s. qualified plan in 2018. the nonqualified defined benefit plans are funded to the extent of benefit payments, which totaled $40 million for the year ended december 31, 2017.
income taxes international paper records its global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates. where the company believes that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in its income tax returns. where treatment of a position is uncertain, liabilities are recorded based upon the company's evaluation of the "more likely than not" outcome considering technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter. changes to recorded liabilities are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the likely outcome, such as settlement with the relevant tax authority, the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year, change in tax laws, or a recent court case that addresses the matter.
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies.
while international paper believes that these judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances, actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts.
the company's effective income tax rates, before equity earnings and discontinued operations, were (128)%, 24% and 37% for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the income tax benefit in 2017 was primarily driven by the recent u.s. tax legislation in december 2017 (see note 10 income taxes on pages 57 through 60 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data). these effective tax rates include the tax effects of certain special items that can significantly affect the effective income tax rate in a given year, but may not recur in subsequent years. management believes that the effective tax rate computed after excluding these special items may provide a better estimate of the rate that might be expected in future years if no additional special items were to occur. however, as a result of recent u.s. tax legislation, which includes a reduction of the u.s. income tax rate from 35% to 21%, we will have a lower worldwide effective income tax rate going forward. excluding these special items, the effective income tax rate for 2017 was 30% of pre-tax earnings compared with 32% in 2016 and 33% in 2015. we estimate that the 2018 effective income tax rate will be approximately 25-27% based on expected earnings and business conditions.
business combinations the company's acquisitions of businesses are accounted for in accordance with asc 805, "business combinations", as amended. we allocate the total consideration of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value as of the business combination date. in developing estimates of fair values for long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, the company utilizes a variety of inputs including forecasted cash flows, anticipated growth rates, discount rates, estimated replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence factors. determining the fair value for specifically identified intangible assets such
34
as customer lists and developed technology involves judgment. we may refine our estimates and make adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed over a measurement period, not to exceed one year. upon the conclusion of the measurement period or the final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are charged to the consolidated statements of earnings. subsequent actual results of the underlying business activity supporting the specifically identified intangible assets could change, requiring us to record impairment charges or adjust their economic lives in future periods.
recent accounting developments see note 2 recent accounting developments on pages 48 through 49 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements.
legal proceedings information concerning the company's environmental and legal proceedings is set forth in note 11 commitments and contingencies on pages 60 through 63 of item  8. financial statements and supplementary data.
effect of inflation while inflationary increases in certain input costs, such as energy, wood fiber and chemical costs, have an impact on the company's operating results, changes in general inflation have had minimal impact on our operating results in each of the last three years. sales prices and volumes are more strongly influenced by economic supply and demand factors in specific markets and by exchange rate fluctuations than by inflationary factors.
foreign currency effects international paper has operations in a number of countries. its operations in those countries also export to, and compete with, imports from other regions. as such, currency movements can have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the company's financial statements. direct impacts include the translation of international operations' local currency financial statements into u.s. dollars and the remeasurement impact associated with non-functional currency financial assets and liabilities. indirect impacts include the change in competitiveness of imports into, and exports out of, the united states (and the impact on local currency pricing of products that are traded internationally). in general, a weaker u.s. dollar and stronger local currency is beneficial to international paper. the currencies that have the most impact are the euro, the brazilian real, the polish zloty and the russian ruble.
market risk we use financial instruments, including fixed and variable rate debt, to finance operations, for capital spending programs and for general corporate purposes. additionally, financial instruments, including various derivative contracts, are used to hedge exposures to interest rate, commodity and foreign currency risks. we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes. information related to international paper's debt obligations is included in note 13 debt and lines of credit on pages 64 and 65 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. a discussion of derivatives and hedging activities is included in note 14 derivatives and hedging activities on pages 65 through 69 of item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
the fair value of our debt and financial instruments varies due to changes in market interest and foreign currency rates and commodity prices since the inception of the related instruments. we assess this market risk utilizing a sensitivity analysis. the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings, fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10% change (increase and decrease) in interest and currency rates and commodity prices.
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short- and long-term debt obligations and investments in marketable securities. we invest in investment-grade securities of financial institutions and money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of aaa and limit exposure to any one issuer or fund. our investments in marketable securities at december 31, 2017 and 2016 are stated at cost, which approximates market due to their short-term nature. our interest rate risk exposure related to these investments was not material.
we issue fixed and floating rate debt in a proportion that management deems appropriate based on current and projected market conditions. derivative instruments, such as, interest rate swaps, may be used to execute this strategy. at december 31, 2017 and 2016, the fair value of the net liability of financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately $11.1 billion and $11.3 billion, respectively. the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10% adverse shift in quoted interest rates would have been approximately $679 million and $623 million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
35
commodity price risk the objective of our commodity exposure management is to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities. commodity swap or forward purchase contracts may be used to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices. the net fair value of such outstanding energy hedge contract at december 31, 2017 and 2016 was approximately a $8 million and a $2 million liability, respectively. the potential loss in fair value resulting from a 10% adverse change in the underlying commodity prices would have been approximately $1 million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
foreign currency risk international paper transacts business in many currencies and is also subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries. our objective in managing the associated foreign currency risks is to minimize the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations on our after-tax cash flows. we address these risks on a limited basis by entering into cross-currency and interest rate swaps, or foreign exchange contracts. at december 31, 2017 and 2016, the net fair value of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately a $10 million asset and a $1 million liability, respectively. the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately $29 million and $23 million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

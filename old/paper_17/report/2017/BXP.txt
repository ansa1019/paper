item 1a. risk factors.
set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors. we refer to the equity and debt securities of both bxp and bplp as our "securities," and the investors who own securities, or both, as our "securityholders." this section contains forward-looking statements. you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 46.
our performance and value are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry.
our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets, and consequently the value of our securities, are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our securityholders will be adversely affected. the following factors, among others, may adversely affect the income generated by our properties:
•   downturns in the national, regional and local economic conditions (particularly increases in unemployment);
•   competition from other office, hotel, retail and residential buildings;
•   local real estate market conditions, such as oversupply or reduction in demand for office, hotel, retail or residential space;
•   changes in interest rates and availability of financing;
•   vacancies, changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair, renovate and re-let space;
•   changes in space utilization by our tenants due to technology, economic conditions and business culture;
•   increased operating costs, including insurance expense, utilities, real estate taxes, state and local taxes and heightened security costs;
•   civil disturbances, earthquakes and other natural disasters or terrorist acts or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses or decrease the desirability to our tenants in impacted locations;
•   significant expenditures associated with each investment, such as debt service payments, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs which are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property;
•   declines in the financial condition of our tenants and our ability to collect rents from our tenants; and
•   decreases in the underlying value of our real estate.
we are dependent upon the economic climates of our markets-boston, los angeles, new york, san francisco and washington, dc.
substantially all of our revenue is derived from properties located in five markets: boston, los angeles, new york, san francisco and washington, dc. a downturn in the economies of these markets, or the impact that a downturn in the overall national economy may have upon these economies, could result in reduced demand for office space and/or a reduction in rents. because our portfolio consists primarily of office buildings (as compared to a more diversified real estate portfolio), a decrease in demand for office space in turn could adversely affect our
13
results of operations. additionally, there are submarkets within our markets that are dependent upon a limited number of industries. for example, in our washington, dc market, we focus on leasing office properties to governmental agencies and contractors, as well as legal firms. a reduction in spending by the federal government could result in reduced demand for office space and adversely affect our results of operations. in addition, in our new york market, we have historically leased properties to financial, legal and other professional firms. a significant downturn in one or more of these sectors could adversely affect our results of operations.
in addition, a significant economic downturn over a period of time could result in an event or change in circumstances that results in an impairment in the value of our properties or our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset (1) is not recoverable over its expected holding period and (2) exceeds its fair value. there can be no assurance that we will not take charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets or investments. any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the charge is taken.
our investment in property development may be costlier than anticipated.
we intend to continue to develop and substantially renovate office, retail and residential properties. our current and future development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks:
•   we may be unable to proceed with the development of properties because we cannot obtain financing on favorable terms or at all;
•   we may incur construction costs for a development project that exceed our original estimates due to increases in interest rates and increased materials, labor, leasing or other costs, which could make completion of the project less profitable because market rents may not increase sufficiently to compensate for the increase in construction costs;
•   we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, required zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project;
•   we may abandon development opportunities after we begin to explore them and as a result we may lose deposits or fail to recover expenses already incurred;
•   we may expend funds on and devote management's time to projects that we do not complete;
•   we may be unable to complete construction and/or leasing of a property on schedule or at all; and
•   we may suspend development projects after construction has begun due to changes in economic conditions or other factors, and this may result in the write-off of costs, payment of additional costs or increases in overall costs when the development project is restarted.
investment returns from our developed properties may be less than anticipated.
our developed properties may be exposed to the following risks:
•   we may lease developed properties at rental rates that are less than the rates projected at the time we decide to undertake the development;
•   operating expenses and construction costs may be greater than projected at the time of development, resulting in our investment being less profitable than we expected; and
•   occupancy rates and rents at newly developed properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, and may result in our investments being less profitable than we expected or not profitable at all.
we face risks associated with the development of mixed-use commercial properties.
we operate, are currently developing, and may in the future develop, properties either alone or through joint ventures with other persons that are known as "mixed-use" developments. this means that in addition to the development of office space, the project may also include space for residential, retail, hotel or other commercial purposes. we have less experience in developing and managing non-office and non-retail real estate than we do with office real estate. as a result, if a development project includes a non-office or non-retail use, we may seek to
14
develop that component ourselves, sell the rights to that component to a third-party developer with experience in that use or we may seek to partner with such a developer. if we do not sell the rights or partner with such a developer, or if we choose to develop the other component ourselves, we would be exposed not only to those risks typically associated with the development of commercial real estate generally, but also to specific risks associated with the development and ownership of non-office and non-retail real estate. in addition, even if we sell the rights to develop the other component or elect to participate in the development through a joint venture, we may be exposed to the risks associated with the failure of the other party to complete the development as expected. these include the risk that the other party would default on its obligations necessitating that we complete the other component ourselves (including providing any necessary financing). in the case of residential properties, these risks include competition for prospective residents from other operators whose properties may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality, location and amenities that the resident seeks. we will also compete against condominiums and single-family homes that are for sale or rent. because we have less experience with residential properties than with office and retail properties, we expect to retain third parties to manage our residential properties. if we decide to not sell or participate in a joint venture and instead hire a third party manager, we would be dependent on them and their key personnel who provide services to us and we may not find a suitable replacement if the management agreement is terminated, or if key personnel leave or otherwise become unavailable to us.
our properties face significant competition.
we face significant competition from developers, owners and operators of office and residential properties and other commercial real estate, including sublease space available from our tenants. substantially all of our properties face competition from similar properties in the same market. this competition may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and may reduce the rents we are able to charge. these competing properties may have vacancy rates higher than our properties, which may result in their owners being willing to lease available space at lower rates than the space in our properties.
we face potential difficulties or delays renewing leases or re-leasing space.
we derive most of our income from rent received from our tenants. if a tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other types of financial distress, it may be unable to make timely rental payments. also, when our tenants decide not to renew their leases or terminate early, we may not be able to re-let the space or there could be a substantial delay in re-letting the space. even if tenants decide to renew or lease new space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants, may be less favorable to us than current lease terms. as a result, our cash flow could decrease and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders could be adversely affected.
we face potential adverse effects from major tenants' bankruptcies or insolvencies.
the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may adversely affect the income produced by our properties. our tenants could file for bankruptcy protection or become insolvent in the future. we cannot evict a tenant solely because of its bankruptcy. on the other hand, a bankrupt tenant may reject and terminate its lease with us. in such case, our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid and future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease, and, even so, our claim for unpaid rent would likely not be paid in full. this shortfall could adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations.
we face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk.
we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. we anticipate that only a small portion of the principal of our debt will be repaid prior to maturity. therefore, we are likely to need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced, extended or repaid with proceeds from other sources, such as new equity capital, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt in years when significant "balloon" payments come due. in addition, we may rely on debt to fund a portion of our new investments such as our acquisition and development activity. there is a risk that we may be unable to finance these activities on favorable terms or at all. these conditions, which increase the cost and reduce the availability of debt, may continue or worsen in the future.
15
we have had and may have in the future agreements with a number of limited partners of bplp who contributed properties in exchange for partnership interests that require bplp to maintain for specified periods of time secured debt on certain of our assets and/or allocate partnership debt to such limited partners to enable them to continue to defer recognition of their taxable gain with respect to the contributed property. these tax protection and debt allocation agreements may restrict our ability to repay or refinance debt.  as of december 31, 2017, we had no tax protection or debt allocation agreement requirements that may restrict our ability to repay or finance debt.
adverse economic and geopolitical conditions and dislocations in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions to you.
our business may be affected by market and economic challenges experienced by the u.s. and global economies or real estate industry as a whole, by the local economic conditions in the markets in which our properties are located, including the impact of high unemployment, volatility in the public equity and debt markets, and international economic conditions. these current conditions, or similar conditions existing in the future, may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions as a result of the following, among other potential consequences:
•   the financial condition of our tenants, many of which are media and technology, financial, legal and other professional firms, may be adversely affected, which may result in tenant defaults under leases due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failures or for other reasons;
•   significant job losses in the financial and professional services industries may occur, which may decrease demand for our office space, causing market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted;
•   our ability to borrow on terms and conditions that we find acceptable, or at all, may be limited, which could reduce our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt, reduce our returns from our acquisition and development activities and increase our future interest expense;
•   reduced values of our properties may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or to obtain debt financing secured by our properties and may reduce the availability of unsecured loans;
•   the value and liquidity of our short-term investments and cash deposits could be reduced as a result of a deterioration of the financial condition of the institutions that hold our cash deposits or the institutions or assets in which we have made short-term investments, a dislocation of the markets for our short-term investments, increased volatility in market rates for such investments or other factors;
•   one or more lenders under our line of credit could refuse to fund their financing commitment to us or could fail and we may not be able to replace the financing commitment of any such lenders on favorable terms, or at all; and
•   to the extent we enter into derivative financial instruments, one or more counterparties to our derivative financial instruments could default on their obligations to us, or could fail, increasing the risk that we may not realize the benefits of these instruments.
an increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt or sell assets on favorable terms or at all.
as of february 22, 2018, we had approximately $210 million of outstanding indebtedness, excluding our unconsolidated joint ventures, that bears interest at variable rates, and we may incur more indebtedness in the future. if interest rates increase, then so would the interest costs on our unhedged variable rate debt, which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders. further, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or significantly increase our future interest expense. from time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements and other interest rate hedging contracts, including swaps, caps and floors. while these agreements are intended to lessen the impact of rising interest rates on us, they also expose us to the risk that the other parties to the agreements will not perform, we could incur significant costs associated with the settlement of the agreements, the agreements will be unenforceable and the underlying transactions will fail to qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges under guidance included in asc 815 "derivatives and hedging." in addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amounts third-parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.
16
covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition.
the mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit our ability, without the prior consent of the lender, to further mortgage the applicable property or to discontinue insurance coverage. our unsecured credit facility, unsecured debt securities and certain secured loans contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness, including total debt to asset ratios, secured debt to total asset ratios, debt service coverage ratios and minimum ratios of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt, which we must maintain. our continued ability to borrow under our credit facilities is subject to compliance with our financial and other covenants. in addition, our failure to comply with such covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt agreement, and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources. under those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to us, or be available only on unattractive terms. additionally, in the future our ability to satisfy current or prospective lenders' insurance requirements may be adversely affected if lenders generally insist upon greater insurance coverage against acts of terrorism or losses resulting from earthquakes than is available to us in the marketplace or on commercially reasonable terms.
we rely on debt financing, including borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, issuances of unsecured debt securities and debt secured by individual properties, to finance our existing portfolio, our acquisition and development activities and for working capital. if we are unable to obtain debt financing from these or other sources, or to refinance existing indebtedness upon maturity, our financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected. if we breach covenants in our debt agreements, the lenders can declare a default and, if the debt is secured, can take possession of the property securing the defaulted loan. in addition, our unsecured debt agreements contain specific cross-default provisions with respect to specified other indebtedness, giving the unsecured lenders the right to declare a default if we are in default under other loans in some circumstances. defaults under our debt agreements could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or affect the market price of our equity and debt securities.
on february 22, 2018, our consolidated debt was approximately $10.4 billion (excluding unconsolidated joint venture debt).

our degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes. our senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by the three major rating agencies. however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain this rating, and in the event our senior debt is downgraded from its current rating, we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and/or difficulty in obtaining additional financing. our degree of leverage could also make us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy generally. there is a risk that changes in our debt to market capitalization ratio, which is in part a function of bxp's stock price, or bplp's ratio of indebtedness to other measures of asset value used by financial analysts may have an adverse effect on the market price of our equity or debt securities.
we face risks associated with property acquisitions.
we have acquired in the past and intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of properties and portfolios of properties, including large portfolios that could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure. our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:
•   even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for a property, we may be unable to complete that acquisition after making a non-refundable deposit and incurring certain other acquisition-related costs;
•   we may be unable to obtain or assume financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all;
•   acquired properties may fail to perform as expected;
•   the actual costs of repositioning, redeveloping or maintaining acquired properties may be greater than our estimates;
•   the acquisition agreement will likely contain conditions to closing, including completion of due diligence investigations to our satisfaction or other conditions that are not within our control, which may not be satisfied;
•   acquired properties may be located in new markets, either within or outside the united states, where we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, lack of business relationships in the area, costs associated with opening a new regional office and unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures;
•   we may acquire real estate through the acquisition of the ownership entity subjecting us to the risks of that entity; and
•   we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
we have acquired in the past and in the future may acquire properties through the acquisition of first mortgage or mezzanine debt. investments in these loans must be carefully structured to ensure that bxp continues to satisfy the various asset and income requirements applicable to reits. if we fail to structure any such acquisition properly, bxp could fail to qualify as a reit. in addition, acquisitions of first mortgage or mezzanine loans subject us to the risks associated with the borrower's default, including potential bankruptcy, and there may be significant delays and costs associated with the process of foreclosure on collateral securing or supporting these investments.  there can be no assurance that we would recover any or all of our investment in the event of such a default or bankruptcy.
we have acquired in the past and in the future may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in bplp. this acquisition structure has the effect, among others, of reducing the amount of tax depreciation we can deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties, and typically requires that we agree to protect the contributors' ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired properties and/or the allocation of partnership debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases. these restrictions could limit our ability to sell an asset at a time, or on terms, that would be favorable absent such restrictions.
acquired properties may expose us to unknown liability.
we may acquire properties or invest in joint ventures that own properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, against the prior owners or other third parties with respect to unknown liabilities. as a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might
18
have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include:
•   liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination;
•   claims by tenants, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties;
•   liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; and
•   claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.
competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties.
we plan to continue to acquire properties as we are presented with attractive opportunities. we may face competition for acquisition opportunities with other investors, and this competition may adversely affect us by subjecting us to the following risks:
•   we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other well-capitalized real estate investors, including publicly traded and private reits, institutional investment funds and other real estate investors; and
•   even if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price.
any future international activities will be subject to special risks and we may not be able to effectively manage our international business.
we have underwritten, and in the future may acquire, properties, portfolios of properties or interests in real estate-related entities on a strategic or selective basis in international markets that are new to us. if we acquire properties or platforms located in these markets, we will face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge and understanding of the local economy, forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local laws and government and permitting procedures. in addition, our international operations will be subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as possible revisions in tax treaties or other laws and regulations, including those governing the taxation of our international income, restrictions on the transfer of funds and uncertainty over terrorist activities. we cannot predict the likelihood that any of these developments may occur. further, we may in the future enter into agreements with non-u.s. entities that are governed by the laws of, and are subject to dispute resolution in the courts of, another country or region. we cannot accurately predict whether such a forum would provide us with an effective and efficient means of resolving disputes that may arise.
investments in international markets may also subject us to risks associated with funding increasing headcount, integrating new offices, and establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate the operations of new offices and to monitor compliance with u.s. laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign laws and regulations, such as the u.k. bribery act.
we may be subject to risks from potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and the currencies of the other countries in which we invest.
if we invest in countries where the u.s. dollar is not the national currency, we will be subject to international currency risks from the potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and the currencies of those other countries. a significant depreciation in the value of the currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may materially affect our results of operations. we may attempt to mitigate any such effects by borrowing in the currency of the country in which we are investing and, under certain circumstances, by hedging exchange rate fluctuations; however, access to capital may be more restricted, or unavailable on favorable terms or at all, in certain locations. for leases denominated in international currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage the international currency exchange risk. we cannot assure you, however, that our efforts will successfully neutralize all international currency risks.
our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments.
in appropriate circumstances, we intend to develop, acquire and recapitalize properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures. we currently have joint ventures
19
that are and are not consolidated within our financial statements. our participation in joint ventures subjects us to risks, including but not limited to, the following risks that:
•   we could become engaged in a dispute with any of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to develop, finance or operate a property and could lead to the sale of either parties' ownership interest or the property;
•   some of our joint ventures are subject to debt and in the current credit markets the refinancing of such debt may require equity capital calls;
•   our joint venture partners may default on their obligations necessitating that we fulfill their obligation ourselves;
•   our joint venture partners may have different objectives than we have regarding the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of properties or the commencement of development activities;
•   our joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes and this could create conflicts of interest;
•   our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest;
•   our joint ventures may be unable to repay any amounts that we may loan to them; and
•   our joint venture agreements may contain provisions limiting the liquidity of our interest for sale.
we may have difficulty selling our properties, which may limit our flexibility.
properties like the ones that we own could be difficult to sell. this may limit our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. in addition, federal tax laws limit our ability to sell properties and this may affect our ability to sell properties without adversely affecting returns to our securityholders. these restrictions reduce our ability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
our ability to dispose of some of our properties is constrained by their tax attributes. properties which we developed and have owned for a significant period of time or which we acquired through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in bplp often have low tax bases. furthermore, as a reit, bxp may be subject to a 100% "prohibited transactions" tax on the gain from dispositions of property if bxp is deemed to hold the property primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, unless the disposition qualifies under a safe harbor exception for properties that have been held for at least two years and with respect to which certain other requirements are met. the potential application of the prohibited transactions tax could cause us to forego potential dispositions of property or other opportunities that might otherwise be attractive to us, or to undertake such dispositions or other opportunities through a taxable reit subsidiary, which would generally result in income taxes being incurred. if we dispose of these properties outright in taxable transactions, we may be required to distribute a significant amount of the taxable gain to our securityholders under the requirements of the internal revenue code for reits, which in turn would impact our future cash flow and may increase our leverage. in some cases, without incurring additional costs we may be restricted from disposing of properties contributed in exchange for our partnership interests under tax protection agreements with contributors. to dispose of low basis or tax-protected properties efficiently we from time to time use like-kind exchanges, which are intended to qualify for non-recognition of taxable gain, but can be difficult to consummate and result in the property for which the disposed assets are exchanged inheriting their low tax bases and other tax attributes (including tax protection covenants).
conflicts of interest exist with holders of interests in bplp.
sales of properties and repayment of related indebtedness will have different effects on holders of interests in bplp than on bxp's stockholders.
some holders of interests in bplp could incur adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties and on the repayment of related debt which differ from the tax consequences to bxp and its stockholders. consequently, such holders of partnership interests in bplp may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale or repayment of debt. while bxp has exclusive authority under the limited partnership agreement of bplp to determine when to refinance or repay debt or whether, when, and on what terms to sell a property, subject, in the case of certain properties, to the contractual commitments described
20
below, any such decision would require the approval of bxp's board of directors. while the board of directors has a policy with respect to these matters directors and executive officers could exercise their influence in a manner inconsistent with the interests of some, or a majority, of bxp's stockholders, including in a manner which could prevent completion of a sale of a property or the repayment of indebtedness.
agreement not to sell some properties.
we have had and may have in the future agreements with the contributors of some properties that we have acquired in exchange for partnership interests in bplp pursuant to which we have agreed not to sell or otherwise transfer the properties, prior to specified dates, in any transaction that would trigger taxable income to the contributor. in addition, we are responsible for the reimbursement of certain tax-related costs to the prior owners if the subject properties are sold in a taxable sale. in general, our obligations to the prior owners are limited in time and only apply to actual damages suffered.
bplp has also entered into agreements providing prior owners of properties with the right to guarantee specific amounts of indebtedness and, in the event that the specific indebtedness they guarantee is repaid or reduced, additional and/or substitute indebtedness. these agreements may hinder actions that bplp may otherwise desire to take to repay or refinance guaranteed indebtedness because bplp would be required to make payments to the beneficiaries of such agreements if it violates these agreements. as of december 31, 2017, no properties were subject to these restrictions.
because we own a hotel property, we face the risks associated with the hospitality industry.
the following factors, among others, are common to the hotel industry, and may reduce the receipts generated by our hotel property:
•   our hotel property competes for guests with other hotels, a number of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than our hotel-operating business partners;
•   if there is an increase in operating costs resulting from inflation and other factors, our hotel-operating business partners may not be able to offset such increase by increasing room rates;
•   our hotel property is subject to the fluctuating and seasonal demands of business travelers and tourism; and
•   our hotel property is subject to general and local economic and social conditions that may affect demand for travel in general, including war and terrorism.
in addition, because our hotel property is located in cambridge, massachusetts, it is subject to the cambridge market's fluctuations in demand, increases in operating costs and increased competition from additions in supply.
we face risks associated with short-term liquid investments.
we may invest cash balances in a variety of short-term investments that are intended to preserve principal value and maintain a high degree of liquidity while providing current income. from time to time, these investments may include (either directly or indirectly):
•   direct obligations issued by the u.s. treasury;
•   obligations issued or guaranteed by the u.s. government or its agencies;
•   taxable municipal securities;
•   obligations (including certificates of deposit) of banks and thrifts;
•   commercial paper and other instruments consisting of short-term u.s. dollar denominated obligations issued by corporations and banks;
•   repurchase agreements collateralized by corporate and asset-backed obligations;
•   both registered and unregistered money market funds; and
•   other highly rated short-term securities.
21
investments in these securities and funds are not insured against loss of principal. under certain circumstances we may be required to redeem all or part of our investment, and our right to redeem some or all of our investment may be delayed or suspended. in addition, there is no guarantee that our investments in these securities or funds will be redeemable at par value. a decline in the value of our investment or a delay or suspension of our right to redeem may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed.
we depend on the efforts of key personnel, particularly owen d. thomas, chief executive officer, douglas t. linde, president, and raymond a. ritchey, senior executive vice president. among the reasons that messrs. thomas, linde and ritchey are important to our success is that each has a national reputation, which attracts business and investment opportunities and assists us in negotiations with lenders, joint venture partners and other investors. if we lost their services, our relationships with lenders, potential tenants and industry personnel could diminish.
our chief financial officer and regional managers also have strong reputations. their reputations aid us in identifying opportunities, having opportunities brought to us, and negotiating with tenants and build-to-suit prospects. while we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services could materially and adversely affect our operations because of diminished relationships with lenders, prospective tenants and industry personnel.
compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.
the americans with disabilities act generally requires that certain buildings, including office buildings, residential buildings and hotels, be made accessible to disabled persons. noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. if, under the americans with disabilities act, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to our securityholders.
our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. if we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations.
failure to comply with federal government contractor requirements could result in substantial costs and loss of substantial revenue.
as of december 31, 2017, the u.s. government was our largest tenant by square feet. we are subject to compliance with a wide variety of complex legal requirements because we are a federal government contractor. these laws regulate how we conduct business, require us to administer various compliance programs and require us to impose compliance responsibilities on some of our contractors. our failure to comply with these laws could subject us to fines, penalties and damages, cause us to be in default of our leases and other contracts with the federal government and bar us from entering into future leases and other contracts with the federal government. there can be no assurance that these costs and loss of revenue will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations or business.
some potential losses are not covered by insurance.
we carry insurance coverage on our properties, including those under development, of types and in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are in line with coverage customarily obtained by owners of similar properties. certain properties owned in joint ventures with third parties are insured by the third party partner with insurance coverage of types and in amounts and with deductibles we believe are in line with coverage customarily obtained by owners of similar properties. in response to the uncertainty in the insurance market following the terrorist attacks of september 11, 2001, the federal terrorism risk insurance act (as amended, "tria") was enacted in november 2002 to require regulated insurers to make available coverage for "certified" acts of terrorism (as defined by the statute). the expiration date of tria was extended to december 31, 2014 by the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2007 and further extended to december 31, 2020 by the terrorism risk insurance
22
program reauthorization act of 2015 ("tripra"), and we can provide no assurance that it will be extended further. currently, our property insurance program per occurrence limits are $1.0 billion for our portfolio insurance program, including coverage for acts of terrorism other than nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological terrorism ("terrorism coverage"). we also carry $250 million of terrorism coverage for 601 lexington avenue, new york, new york ("601 lexington avenue") in excess of the $1.0 billion of coverage in our property insurance program. certain properties, including the general motors building located at 767 fifth avenue in new york, new york ("767 fifth avenue"), are currently insured in separate insurance programs. the property insurance program per occurrence limits for 767 fifth avenue are $1.625 billion, including terrorism coverage. we also currently carry nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological terrorism insurance coverage for acts of terrorism certified under tria ("nbcr coverage"), which is provided by ixp as a direct insurer, for the properties in our portfolio, including 767 fifth avenue, but excluding certain other properties owned in joint ventures with third parties or which we manage. the per occurrence limit for nbcr coverage is $1.0 billion. under tria, after the payment of the required deductible and coinsurance, the nbcr coverage provided by ixp is backstopped by the federal government if the aggregate industry insured losses resulting from a certified act of terrorism exceed a "program trigger." in 2017, the program trigger was $140 million and the coinsurance was 17%, however, both will increase in subsequent years pursuant to tripra. if the federal government pays out for a loss under tria, it is mandatory that the federal government recoup the full amount of the loss from insurers offering tria coverage after the payment of the loss pursuant to a formula in tripra. we may elect to terminate the nbcr coverage if the federal government seeks recoupment for losses paid under tria, if there is a change in our portfolio or for any other reason. we intend to continue to monitor the scope, nature and cost of available terrorism insurance and maintain terrorism insurance in amounts and on terms that are commercially reasonable.
we also currently carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas known to be subject to earthquakes in an amount and subject to self-insurance that we believe is commercially reasonable. in addition, this insurance is subject to a deductible in the amount of 3% of the value of the affected property. specifically, we currently carry earthquake insurance which covers our san francisco (including salesforce tower) and los angeles regions with a $240 million (increased from $170 million on march 1, 2017) per occurrence limit, and a $240 million (increased from $170 million on march 1, 2017) annual aggregate limit, $20 million of which is provided by ixp, as a direct insurer. prior to march 1, 2017, the builders risk policy maintained for the development of salesforce tower in san francisco included a $60 million per occurrence and annual aggregate limit of earthquake coverage. the amount of our earthquake insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses from earthquakes. in addition, the amount of earthquake coverage could impact our ability to finance properties subject to earthquake risk. we may discontinue earthquake insurance or change the structure of our earthquake insurance program on some or all of our properties in the future if the premiums exceed our estimation of the value of the coverage.
ixp, a captive insurance company which is a wholly-owned subsidiary, acts as a direct insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage for our greater san francisco and los angeles properties and our nbcr coverage. insofar as we own ixp, we are responsible for its liquidity and capital resources, and the accounts of ixp are part of our consolidated financial statements. in particular, if a loss occurs which is covered by our nbcr coverage but is less than the applicable program trigger under tria, ixp would be responsible for the full amount of the loss without any backstop by the federal government. ixp would also be responsible for any recoupment charges by the federal government in the event losses are paid out and its insurance policy is maintained after the payout by the federal government. if we experience a loss and ixp is required to pay under its insurance policy, we would ultimately record the loss to the extent of the required payment. therefore, insurance coverage provided by ixp should not be considered as the equivalent of third-party insurance, but rather as a modified form of self-insurance. in addition, bplp has issued a guarantee to cover liabilities of ixp in the amount of $20 million.
the mortgages on our properties typically contain requirements concerning the financial ratings of the insurers who provide policies covering the property. we provide the lenders on a regular basis with the identity of the insurance companies in our insurance programs. the ratings of some of our insurers are below the rating requirements in some of our loan agreements and the lenders for these loans could attempt to claim that an event of default has occurred under the loan. we believe we could obtain insurance with insurers which satisfy the rating requirements. additionally, in the future, our ability to obtain debt financing secured by individual properties, or the terms of such financing, may be adversely affected if lenders generally insist on ratings for insurers or amounts of insurance which are difficult to obtain or which result in a commercially unreasonable premium. there can be no assurance that a deficiency in the financial ratings of one or more of our insurers will not have a material adverse effect on us.
23
we continue to monitor the state of the insurance market in general, and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism and california earthquake risk in particular, but we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years. there are other types of losses, such as from wars, for which we cannot obtain insurance at all or at a reasonable cost. with respect to such losses and losses from acts of terrorism, earthquakes or other catastrophic events, if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties. depending on the specific circumstances of each affected property, it is possible that we could be liable for mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition and results of operations.
actual or threatened terrorist attacks may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties.
we have significant investments in large metropolitan markets that have been or may be in the future the targets of actual or threatened terrorism attacks, including boston, los angeles, new york, san francisco and washington, dc. as a result, some tenants in these markets may choose to relocate their businesses to other markets or to lower-profile office buildings within these markets that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity. this could result in an overall decrease in the demand for office space in these markets generally or in our properties in particular, which could increase vacancies in our properties or necessitate that we lease our properties on less favorable terms or both. in addition, future terrorist attacks in these markets could directly or indirectly damage our properties, both physically and financially, or cause losses that materially exceed our insurance coverage. as a result of the foregoing, our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties could decline materially. see also "-some potential losses are not covered by insurance."
we face risks associated with our tenants and contractual counterparties being designated "prohibited persons" by the office of foreign assets control.
pursuant to executive order 13224 and other laws, the office of foreign assets control of the united states department of the treasury ("ofac") maintains a list of persons designated as terrorists or who are otherwise blocked or banned ("prohibited persons"). ofac regulations and other laws prohibit conducting business or engaging in transactions with prohibited persons (the "ofac requirements"). certain of our loan and other agreements require us to comply with ofac requirements. we have established a compliance program whereby tenants and others with whom we conduct business are checked against the ofac list of prohibited persons prior to entering into any agreement and on a periodic basis thereafter. our leases and other agreements, in general, require the other party to comply with ofac requirements. if a tenant or other party with whom we contract is placed on the ofac list we may be required by the ofac requirements to terminate the lease or other agreement. any such termination could result in a loss of revenue or a damage claim by the other party that the termination was wrongful.
we face possible risks associated with the physical effects of climate change.
the physical effects of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations and business. for example, many of our properties are located along the east and west coasts, particularly those in the central business districts of boston, los angeles, new york, san francisco and washington, dc. to the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns, our markets could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea-levels. over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for office space in our buildings or our inability to operate the buildings at all. climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable, increasing the cost of energy and increasing the cost of snow removal at our properties. there can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations or business.
potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs.
under federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be required to investigate and clean up the effects of releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at or migrating from our properties simply because of our current or past ownership or operation of the real estate. if unidentified environmental problems arise, we may have to make substantial payments, which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders, because: as owner or operator we may have to pay for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with the contamination; the law typically imposes clean-up responsibility and liability regardless of whether the owner or
24
operator knew of or caused the contamination; even if more than one person may be responsible for the contamination, each person who shares legal liability under the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs; and governmental entities and third parties may sue the owner or operator of a contaminated site for damages and costs.
these costs could be substantial and in extreme cases could exceed the amount of our insurance or the value of the contaminated property. we currently carry environmental insurance in an amount and subject to deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable. specifically, we carry a pollution legal liability policy with a $20 million limit per incident and a policy aggregate limit of $40 million. the presence or migration of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or the failure to properly remediate contamination may give rise to third-party claims for bodily injury, property damage and/or response costs and may materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against, sell or rent an affected property. in addition, applicable environmental laws create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with contamination. changes in laws, regulations and practices and their implementation increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing at our properties, or increasing the restrictions on the handling, storage or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or other actions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures.
environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos and other building materials. for example, laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos:
•   properly manage and maintain the asbestos;
•   notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos; and
•   undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building.
such laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers.
some of our properties are located in urban and previously developed areas where fill or current or historic industrial uses of the areas have caused site contamination. it is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update phase i environmental site assessments and asbestos surveys with respect to our acquisition of properties. these assessments generally include a visual inspection of the properties and the surrounding areas, an examination of current and historical uses of the properties and the surrounding areas and a review of relevant state, federal and historical documents, but do not involve invasive techniques such as soil and ground water sampling. where appropriate, on a property-by-property basis, our practice is to have these consultants conduct additional testing, including sampling for asbestos, for lead and other contaminants in drinking water and, for soil and/or groundwater contamination where underground storage tanks are or were located or where other past site usage creates a potential environmental problem. even though these environmental assessments are conducted, there is still the risk that:
•   the environmental assessments and updates did not identify or properly address all potential environmental liabilities;
•   a prior owner created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the assessments;
•   new environmental liabilities have developed since the environmental assessments were conducted; and
•   future uses or conditions such as changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in environmental liability for us.
inquiries about indoor air quality may necessitate special investigation and, depending on the results, remediation beyond our regular indoor air quality testing and maintenance programs. indoor air quality issues can stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contaminants from indoor or outdoor sources, and biological contaminants such as molds, pollen, viruses and bacteria. indoor exposure to chemical or biological contaminants above certain levels can be alleged to be connected to allergic reactions or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals. if these conditions were to occur at one of our properties, we may be subject to third-party claims for personal injury, or may need to undertake a targeted remediation program, including without limitation,
25
steps to increase indoor ventilation rates and eliminate sources of contaminants. such remediation programs could be costly, necessitate the temporary relocation of some or all of the property's tenants or require rehabilitation of the affected property.
we face risks associated with security breaches through cyber attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology (it) networks and related systems.
we face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems. the risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations (including managing our building systems) and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of it networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. even the most well-protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases, are designed not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.
a security breach or other significant disruption involving our it networks and related systems could:
•   disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our tenants;
•   result in misstated financial reports, violations of loan covenants, missed reporting deadlines and/or missed permitting deadlines;
•   result in our inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding bxp's qualification as a reit;
•   result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or which could expose us to damage claims by third-parties for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;
•   result in our inability to maintain the building systems relied upon by our tenants for the efficient use of their leased space;
•   require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result;
•   subject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties or termination of leases or other agreements; and
•   damage our reputation among our tenants and investors generally.
any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
we did not obtain new owner's title insurance policies in connection with properties acquired during bxp's initial public offering.
we acquired many of our properties from our predecessors at the completion of bxp's initial public offering in june 1997. before we acquired these properties, each of them was insured by a title insurance policy. we did not obtain new owner's title insurance policies in connection with the acquisition of these properties. to the extent we have financed properties after acquiring them in connection with the initial public offering, we have obtained new title insurance policies, however, the amount of these policies may be less than the current or future value of the applicable properties. nevertheless, because in many instances we acquired these properties indirectly by
26
acquiring ownership of the entity that owned the property and those owners remain in existence as our subsidiaries, some of these title insurance policies may continue to benefit us. many of these title insurance policies may be for amounts less than the current or future values of the applicable properties. if there was a title defect related to any of these properties, or to any of the properties acquired at the time of the initial public offering of bxp, that is no longer covered by a title insurance policy, we could lose both our capital invested in and our anticipated profits from such property. we have obtained title insurance policies for all properties that we have acquired after the initial public offering of bxp, however, these policies may be for amounts less than the current or future values of the applicable properties.
we may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could negatively impact our financial condition.
at any time, the u.s. federal income tax laws governing reits or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended, including with respect to our hotel ownership structure. we cannot predict if or when any new u.s. federal income tax law, regulation, or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing u.s. federal income tax law, treasury regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective and any such law, regulation, or interpretation may take effect retroactively. bxp, its taxable reit subsidiaries, and our securityholders could be adversely affected by any such change in, or any new, u.s. federal income tax law, treasury regulation or administrative interpretation.
the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the "tcja"), signed into law on december 22, 2017, represents sweeping tax reform legislation that makes significant changes to corporate and individual tax rates and the calculation of taxes.  while we currently do not expect the tcja will have a significant direct impact on us, it may impact us indirectly as our tenants and the jurisdictions in which we do business as well as the overall investment thesis for reits may be impacted both positively and negatively in ways that are difficult to predict. additionally, the overall impact of the tcja depends on future interpretations and regulations that may be issued by federal tax authorities, as well as changes in state and local taxation in response to the tcja, and it is possible that such future interpretations, regulations and other changes could adversely impact us.
we face possible adverse state local tax audits and changes in state and local tax law.
because bxp is organized and qualifies as a reit, it is generally not subject to federal income taxes, but we are subject to certain state and local taxes. in the normal course of business, certain entities through which we own real estate either have undergone, or are currently undergoing, tax audits. although we believe that we have substantial arguments in favor of our positions in the ongoing audits, in some instances there is no controlling precedent or interpretive guidance on the specific point at issue. collectively, tax deficiency notices received to date from the jurisdictions conducting the ongoing audits have not been material. however, there can be no assurance that future audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
from time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted, which may result in an increase in our tax liability. a shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. if such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. these increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends and distributions to our securityholders.
changes in accounting pronouncements could adversely affect our operating results, in addition to the reported financial performance of our tenants.
accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standard-setting by the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission, which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for u.s. companies, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. proposed changes include, but are not limited to, changes in revenue recognition, lease accounting and the adoption of accounting standards likely to require the increased use of "fair-value" measures.
these changes could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations. in some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements. similarly, these changes could have a material impact on our
27
tenants' reported financial condition or results of operations or could affect our tenants' preferences regarding leasing real estate.
failure to qualify as a reit would cause bxp to be taxed as a corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of dividends.
if bxp fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, it will be taxed as a corporation unless certain relief provisions apply. we believe that bxp is organized and qualified as a reit and intends to operate in a manner that will allow bxp to continue to qualify as a reit. however, we cannot assure you that bxp is qualified as such, or that it will remain qualified as such in the future. this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code as to which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of facts and circumstances not entirely within our control. future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification.
in addition, we currently hold certain of our properties through subsidiaries that have elected to be taxed as reits and we may in the future determine that it is in our best interests to hold one or more of our other properties through one or more subsidiaries that elect to be taxed as reits. if any of these subsidiaries fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, then bxp may also fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes.
if bxp or any of its subsidiaries that are reits fails to qualify as a reit then, unless certain relief provisions apply, it will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for payment of dividends for each of the years involved because:
•   bxp would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing its taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates;
•   bxp also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for tax years ending before january 1, 2018 and possibly increased state and local taxes; and
•   unless bxp is entitled to relief under statutory provisions, bxp could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which it was disqualified.
in addition, if bxp fails to qualify as a reit and the relief provisions do not apply, it will no longer be required to pay dividends. as a result of all these factors, bxp's failure to qualify as a reit could impair our ability to raise capital and expand our business, and it would adversely affect the value of bxp's common stock. if bxp or any of its subsidiaries that are reits fails to qualify as a reit but is eligible for certain relief provisions, then it may retain its status as a reit, but may be required to pay a penalty tax, which could be substantial.
in order to maintain bxp's reit status, we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions.
in order to maintain bxp's reit status, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the reit distribution requirements, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. to qualify as a reit, bxp generally must distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its taxable income each year, excluding capital gains and with certain other adjustments. in addition, bxp will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which dividends paid in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of ordinary income, 95% of capital gain net income and 100% of undistributed income from prior years. we may need short-term debt or long-term debt or proceeds from asset sales, creation of joint ventures or sales of common stock to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the recognition of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. any inability of our cash flows to cover our distribution requirements could have an adverse impact on our ability to raise short- and long-term debt or sell equity securities in order to fund distributions required to maintain bxp's reit status.
limits on changes in control may discourage takeover attempts beneficial to stockholders.
provisions in bxp's charter and bylaws, bxp's shareholder rights agreement and the limited partnership agreement of bplp, as well as provisions of the internal revenue code and delaware corporate law, may:
28
•   delay or prevent a change of control over bxp or a tender offer, even if such action might be beneficial to bxp's stockholders; and
•   limit bxp's stockholders' opportunity to receive a potential premium for their shares of common stock over then-prevailing market prices.
stock ownership limit to facilitate maintenance of bxp's qualification as a reit and to otherwise address concerns relating to concentration of stock ownership, bxp's charter generally prohibits ownership, directly, indirectly or beneficially, by any single stockholder of more than 6.6% of the number of outstanding shares of any class or series of its common stock. we refer to this limitation as the "ownership limit." bxp's board of directors may waive, in its sole discretion, or modify the ownership limit with respect to one or more persons if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize bxp's status as a reit for federal income tax purposes. in addition, under bxp's charter, each of mortimer b. zuckerman and the respective families and affiliates of mortimer b. zuckerman and edward h. linde, as well as, in general, pension plans and mutual funds, may actually and beneficially own up to 15% of the number of outstanding shares of any class or series of bxp's equity common stock. shares owned in violation of the ownership limit will be subject to the loss of rights to distributions and voting and other penalties. the ownership limit may have the effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control.
bplp's partnership agreement bxp has agreed in the limited partnership agreement of bplp not to engage in specified extraordinary transactions, including, among others, business combinations, unless limited partners of bplp other than bxp receives, or have the opportunity to receive, either (1) the same consideration for their partnership interests as holders of bxp common stock in the transaction or (2) limited partnership units that, among other things, would entitle the holders, upon redemption of these units, to receive shares of common equity of a publicly traded company or the same consideration as holders of bxp common stock received in the transaction. if these limited partners would not receive such consideration, we cannot engage in the transaction unless limited partners holding at least 75% of the common units of limited partnership interest, other than those held by bxp or its affiliates, consent to the transaction. in addition, bxp has agreed in the limited partnership agreement of bplp that it will not complete specified extraordinary transactions, including among others, business combinations, in which bxp receive the approval of its common stockholders unless (1) limited partners holding at least 75% of the common units of limited partnership interest, other than those held by bxp or its affiliates, consent to the transaction or (2) the limited partners of bplp are also allowed to vote and the transaction would have been approved had these limited partners been able to vote as common stockholders on the transaction. therefore, if bxp's common stockholders approve a specified extraordinary transaction, the partnership agreement requires the following before it can complete the transaction:
•   holders of partnership interests in bplp, including bxp, must vote on the matter;
•   bxp must vote its partnership interests in the same proportion as its stockholders voted on the transaction; and
•   the result of the vote of holders of partnership interests in bplp must be such that had such vote been a vote of stockholders, the business combination would have been approved.
with respect to specified extraordinary transactions, bxp has agreed in bplp's partnership agreement to use its commercially reasonable efforts to structure such a transaction to avoid causing its limited partners to recognize gain for federal income tax purposes by virtue of the occurrence of or their participation in such a transaction.
as a result of these provisions, a potential acquirer may be deterred from making an acquisition proposal, and bxp may be prohibited by contract from engaging in a proposed extraordinary transaction, including a proposed business combination, even though bxp stockholders approve of the transaction.
changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of bxp's common stock.
as with other publicly traded equity securities, the value of bxp's common stock depends on various market conditions that may change from time to time. among the market conditions that may affect the value of bxp's common stock are the following:
•   the extent of investor interest in our securities;
29
•   the general reputation of reits and the attractiveness of our equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate-based companies;

the market value of bxp's common stock is based primarily upon the market's perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash dividends. consequently, bxp's common stock may trade at prices that are greater or less than bxp's net asset value per share of common stock. if our future earnings or cash dividends are less than expected, it is likely that the market price of bxp's common stock will diminish.
further issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to current securityholders.
the interests of our existing securityholders could be diluted if additional equity securities are issued to finance future developments, acquisitions or repay indebtedness. our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing, including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt, and equity financing, including common and preferred equity.
the number of shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of bxp's stock.
in connection with and subsequent to bxp's initial public offering, we have completed many private placement transactions in which shares of stock of bxp or partnership interests in bplp were issued to owners of properties we acquired or to institutional investors. this common stock, or common stock issuable in exchange for such partnership interests in bplp, may be sold in the public securities markets over time under registration rights we granted to these investors. additional common stock issuable under our employee benefit and other incentive plans, including as a result of the grant of stock options and restricted equity securities, may also be sold in the market at some time in the future. future sales of bxp common stock in the market could adversely affect the price of its common stock. we cannot predict the effect the perception in the market that such sales may occur will have on the market price of bxp's common stock.
we may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our stockholders.
our operating and financial policies, including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends, are exclusively determined by bxp's board of directors. accordingly, our securityholders do not control these policies.
item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.

overview bxp is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed reit and one of the largest owners, managers and developers of primarily class a office properties in the united states. bplp is the entity through which bxp conducts substantially all of its business and owns (either directly or through subsidiaries) substantially all of its assets. our properties are concentrated in five markets - boston, los angeles, new york, san francisco and washington, dc. we generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing class a office space to our tenants. when making leasing decisions, we consider, among other things, the creditworthiness of the tenant, the length of the lease, the rental rate to be paid at inception and throughout the lease term, the costs of tenant improvements and other landlord concessions, anticipated operating expenses and real estate taxes, current and anticipated vacancy, current and expected future demand for the space, the impact of any expansion rights and general economic factors.
our core strategy has always been to develop, acquire and operate properties in supply-constrained markets with high barriers-to-entry and to focus on executing long-term leases with financially strong tenants. historically, this combination has tended to reduce our exposure in down cycles and enhance revenues as market conditions improve. to be successful in any leasing environment, we believe we must consider all aspects of the tenant-landlord relationship. in this regard, we believe that our understanding of tenants' short- and long-term space utilization and amenity needs in the local markets, our relationships with local brokers, our reputation as a premier developer, owner and operator of class a office properties, our financial strength and our ability to maintain high building standards provide us with a competitive advantage.

outlook economic growth in the united states remains stable resulting in fourth quarter gdp growth of 2.6%. the federal reserve has increased interest rates four times since december 2016 with indications of more increases to come, yet interest rates remain relatively low by historical standards. in addition, recently passed federal tax reform may provide a boost to the u.s. economy and prolong the current economic recovery. given the pace of gdp growth, low inflation and tax reform, we do not expect a sharp increase in long-term interest rates and expect reasonably healthy operating and financial market conditions to continue.
in this economic climate, we continue to focus on:
•   ensuring tenant satisfaction;
•   leasing available space in our in-service and development properties, as well as focusing on sizable future lease expirations well in advance;
•   completing the construction of our development properties;
•   completing the redevelopment and repositioning of several key properties to increase future revenues and asset values over the long-term, despite the adverse impact on near-term revenue and earnings;
•   maintaining discipline in our underwriting of investment opportunities by (1) seeking significant pre-leasing commitments before beginning new construction, and (2) targeting acquisition activity in non-stabilized assets near innovation centers where we see the best prospects for overall growth and our operational expertise can create value; and
•   managing our near-term debt maturities and maintaining our conservative balance sheet.
the overall occupancy of our in-service properties increased to 90.7% at december 31, 2017 from 90.2% at september 30, 2017 due mainly to increased leasing activity at our boston central business district ("cbd") assets. during the fourth quarter, we signed leases across our portfolio totaling approximately 2.4 million square feet, which is greater than our most recent 10-year historical quarterly average of 1.4 million, and commenced revenue recognition on approximately 1.3 million square feet of leases in second-generation space. of these second-generation leases, approximately 1.0 million square feet had been vacant for less than one year and, in the aggregate, they represent a slight increase in net rental obligations (gross rent less operating expenses) of approximately 0.2%. the muted increase in net rents was primarily due to releasing space at lower rental rates than the expiring tenants at 399 park avenue in our new york region and one lease renewal in suburban montgomery county in our washington, dc region. across our portfolio we continue to experience increases in construction costs, which generally result in increased tenant allowances and costs to build out tenant spaces.
our investment strategy remains mostly unchanged. other than possible acquisitions of value-add assets, such as those requiring lease-up or repositioning, we intend to continue to invest primarily in higher yielding new development opportunities, in each case with significant pre-leasing commitments, rather than lower yielding acquisitions of stabilized assets for which demand and pricing remain strong.
our development activity remains vibrant. as of december 31, 2017, our development pipeline consisted of twelve construction/redevelopment projects that, when completed, we expect will total approximately 6.2 million net rentable square feet. our share of the total budgeted cost for these projects is approximately $3.4 billion, of which approximately $1.5 billion of equity remains to be invested as of december 31, 2017. as of february 22, 2018, approximately 81% of the commercial space in these development projects is pre-leased.
during the fourth quarter of 2017 and into february 2018, we commenced development on two new office projects, including an approximately 276,000 square foot project located in reston, va with 100% of the office space pre-leased to leidos and an approximately 211,000 square foot project located in waltham, ma that is 52% leased, as of february 22, 2018, to an engineering firm. we also commenced our hub on causeway residential joint venture project located in boston, ma. we expect our share of the estimated development costs for these three projects to total approximately $400 million.
in addition, we signed leases with two anchor tenants; 1) a tenant for 66% of the office space for our 2100 pennsylvania avenue project, which we expect to commence development upon receipt of necessary approvals from the district of columbia and the expiration of leases in the existing buildings on the site in 2019 and 2) with fannie mae to lease approximately 850,000 net rentable square feet of class a office space at our reston gateway
48
development project located in reston, virginia. the initial phase of the reston gateway development project will consist of approximately 1.0 million net rentable square feet. we expect to commence the construction of this project in the second half of 2018, upon receipt of all necessary approvals.
during the fourth quarter of 2017, we reduced our overall borrowing cost and extended our debt maturities by redeeming $850 million of 3.700% unsecured senior notes that were scheduled to mature on november 15, 2018 with the proceeds from the issuance of $850 million of 3.200% unsecured senior notes maturing january 15, 2025. excluding our unconsolidated joint ventures assets, we have no debt maturing in 2018 and $700 million of 5.875% unsecured senior notes that matures in october 2019.
given that interest rates remain relatively low, we may elect to supplement our liquidity position to provide additional capacity to fund our remaining capital requirements for existing development and redevelopment projects, refinance debt before maturity and pursue other attractive investment opportunities. depending on the type and timing of financing, raising capital may result in us carrying additional cash and cash equivalents pending our use of the proceeds.
the same factors that create challenges to acquiring assets present opportunities for us to continue to review our portfolio to identify properties as potential sales candidates because they may no longer fit within our portfolio strategy or they could attract premium pricing in the current market environment. we expect to sell a modest number of non-core assets in 2018, subject to market conditions.
a brief overview of each of our markets follows.
boston the greater boston region continues to attract life science and established technology companies, as well as start-up technology and maker organizations. the boston cbd submarket continues to be driven by lease expirations from traditional financial and professional services tenants and a steady flow of new technology companies moving into the cbd. during the fourth quarter of 2017, we signed leases for approximately 68,000 square feet at our 200 clarendon street property, bringing our total leasing at the property to more than 350,000 square feet for 2017 and resulting in the property being 97.8% committed at the end of the year. in january 2018, we signed leases for approximately 25,000 square feet at 200 clarendon street and are negotiating a lease for another approximately 30,000 square feet. in addition, we completed a lease for approximately 147,000 square feet at our hub on causeway podium office project and have reached an agreement with a retail user that, if completed, would bring the total project to 89% leased. we expect to complete the development of this phase of the project in 2019.
the cambridge office market continues to generate strong rental rates. this is evidenced by the releasing, during january 2018, of approximately 90,000 square feet with an increase in net rents of approximately 122%. our approximately 1.6 million square foot in-service office portfolio in cambridge is dominated by large users and is nearly 100% occupied. our suburban waltham/lexington submarket continues to strengthen due to the organic growth of our existing tenant base and other tenants in the market looking for space to accommodate their expanding workforces. during the fourth quarter, we completed approximately 395,000 square feet of leasing in the suburban submarket, including a 110,000 square foot, lease for 52% of our 211,000 square foot 20 citypoint project.
los angeles our colorado center joint venture asset in santa monica, california is approximately 93.8% leased, including leases with future commencement dates, as of december 31, 2017. in our first full year of ownership, our approach to property management, leasing and commitment to invest capital has transformed this once under-leased asset into a top-tier property in the marketplace.
we are committed to growing our presence and portfolio in the los angeles market and expect to continue to underwrite investment opportunities in this market while maintaining our disciplined investment approach.
49
new york our overall expectations for the midtown manhattan office market and the leasing activity in our portfolio remain generally consistent with recent quarters. new supply continues to come into the market in the form of new deliveries and large lease expirations. as a result, tenants have increasing options, and therefore we do not expect significant growth in office rents in the near-term, and we are experiencing higher tenant concessions. however, we are encouraged that we completed leases for approximately 622,000 square feet in the fourth quarter that were primarily long-term renewals. our new york city portfolio occupancy improved to 90.3% as of december 31, 2017 from 90.0% as of september 30, 2017. we are in discussions for large blocks of space at 399 park avenue and one five nine east 53rd street, but we do not expect revenue from replacement tenants to begin until 2019.
san francisco the san francisco cbd leasing market remains healthy and among the strongest markets in the united states. we continue to benefit from this strength as evidenced by the approximately 50,000 square feet of second generation leases that commenced during the fourth quarter of 2017. these leases were for space that had been vacant for less than one year and provided an average increase in net rental obligations of approximately 85.5%.
during the fourth quarter, we leased approximately 205,000 square feet of space at salesforce tower, a class a office project with approximately 1.4 million square feet, and, on december 1, 2017 we partially placed the project in-service. as of february 22, 2018 the project is 97% leased.
washington, dc overall market conditions in the washington cbd have not changed in any meaningful way over the past few quarters. leasing activity remains very competitive primarily because there has been a significant increase in supply without a corresponding increase in demand. outside of the district of columbia, our reston town center properties are approximately 96.7% leased, and leasing activity is healthy for our available and near-term expiring space.
our development activities are active as we signed a lease for an anchor tenant for 66% of the space at our 2100 pennsylvania avenue project. in january 2018, we entered into an approximately 276,000 square foot build-to-suit lease with leidos to construct its new office headquarters at reston town center. in addition, in february 2018, we executed a lease with fannie mae to lease approximately 850,000 net rentable square feet of class a office space at our reston gateway development project located in reston, virginia. the initial phase of the reston gateway development project will consist of approximately 1.0 million net rentable square feet.

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, or gaap, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. from time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.
real estate upon acquisitions of real estate, which includes the consolidation of previously unconsolidated joint ventures, we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets, (including land, buildings, tenant improvements, "above-" and "below-market" leases, leasing and assumed financing origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities) and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land and buildings as if vacant. we assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate, as well as available market information. estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions.
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. we also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants' credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. based on our acquisitions to date, our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial.
we record acquired "above-" and "below-market" leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (2) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. acquired "above-" and "below-market" lease values have been reflected within prepaid expenses and other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets. other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease. factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. in estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. in estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.
management reviews its long-lived assets for impairment following the end of each quarter and when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value. an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding anticipated hold periods, future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. because cash flows on properties considered to be "long-lived assets to be held and used" are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired, our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. if our hold strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. if we determine that an impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value, less cost to sell.
guidance in accounting standards codification ("asc") 360 "property plant and equipment" ("asc 360") requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold, or otherwise qualify
52
as "held for sale," be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale. discontinued operations presentation applies only to disposals representing a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results (e.g., a disposal of a major geographical area, a major line of business, a major equity method investment or other major parts of an entity). the components of the property's net income that are reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain (or loss) upon the disposition of the property held for sale, operating results, depreciation and interest expense (if the property is subject to a secured loan). we generally consider assets to be "held for sale" when the transaction has been approved by bxp's board of directors, or a committee thereof, and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale, such that a sale of the property within one year is considered probable. following the classification of a property as "held for sale," no further depreciation is recorded on the assets, and the asset is written down to the lower of carrying value or fair market value, less cost to sell.
real estate is stated at depreciated cost. a variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. the cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. we capitalize acquisition costs that we incur to effect an asset acquisition and expense acquisition costs that we incur to effect a business combination, including legal, due diligence and other closing related costs. costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized. capitalized development costs include interest, internal wages, property taxes, insurance, and other project costs incurred during the period of development. after the determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. determination of when a development project commences and capitalization begins, and when a development project is substantially complete and held available for occupancy and capitalization must cease, involves a degree of judgment. our capitalization policy on development properties follows the guidance in asc 835-20 "capitalization of interest" and asc 970 "real estate-general." the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs.
the capitalized costs include pre-construction costs necessary to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. we begin the capitalization of costs during the pre-construction period which we define as activities that are necessary for the development of the property. we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. we cease capitalization on the portion (1) substantially completed, (2) occupied or held available for occupancy, and we capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction or (3) if activities necessary for the development of the property have been suspended.
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures we consolidate variable interest entities ("vies") in which we are considered to be the primary beneficiary. vies are entities in which the equity investors do not have sufficient equity at risk to finance their endeavors without additional financial support or that the holders of the equity investment at risk do not have substantive participating rights. the primary beneficiary is defined by the entity having both of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the activities that, when taken together, most significantly impact the variable interest entity's performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive the returns from the variable interest entity that could potentially be significant to the vie. for ventures that are not vies, we consolidate entities for which we have significant decision making control over the ventures' operations. our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity involves the consideration of various factors including the form of our ownership interest, our representation in the entity's governance, the size of our investment (including loans), estimates of future cash flows, our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace us as manager and/or liquidate the venture, if applicable. our assessment of our influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements. in addition to evaluating control rights, we consolidate entities in which the outside partner has no substantive kick-out rights to remove us as the managing member.
accounts of the consolidated entity are included in our accounts and the noncontrolling interest is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of equity or in temporary equity between liabilities and equity. investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are recorded initially at cost, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on the balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset. under the equity method of accounting,
53
our net equity investment is reflected within the consolidated balance sheets, and our share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the consolidated statements of operations. the joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses; however, our recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint venture's distribution priorities, which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds. we may account for cash distributions in excess of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture as income when we are not the general partner in a limited partnership and when we have neither the requirement nor the intent to provide financial support to the joint venture. our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for impairment periodically and we record impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair values below the carrying values has occurred and such decline is other-than-temporary. the ultimate realization of the investment in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value below the carrying value of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other-than-temporary.
to the extent that we contribute assets to a joint venture, our investment in the joint venture is recorded at our cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture. to the extent that our cost basis is different than the basis reflected at the joint venture level, the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in our share of equity in net income of the joint venture. in accordance with the provisions of asc 970-323 "investments-equity method and joint ventures" ("asc 970-323"), we will recognize gains on the contribution of real estate to joint ventures, relating solely to the outside partner's interest, to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale.
the combined summarized financial information of the unconsolidated joint ventures is disclosed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition in general, we commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use. contractual rental revenue is reported on a straight-line basis over the terms of our respective leases. we recognize rental revenue of acquired in-place "above-" and "below-market" leases at their fair values over the original term of the respective leases. accrued rental income as reported on the consolidated balance sheets represents cumulative rental income earned in excess of rent payments received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, the impact of the net adjustments of rents from "above-" and "below-market" leases increased rental revenue by approximately $23.5 million. for the year ended december 31, 2017, the impact of the straight-line rent adjustment increased rental revenue by approximately $54.8 million. those amounts exclude the adjustment of rents from "above-" and "below-market" leases and straight-line income from unconsolidated joint ventures, which are disclosed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
our leasing strategy is generally to secure creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting guidelines. furthermore, following the initiation of a lease, we continue to actively monitor the tenant's creditworthiness to ensure that all tenant related assets are recorded at their realizable value. when assessing tenant credit quality, we:
•   review relevant financial information, including:
•   financial ratios;
•   net worth;
•   revenue;
•   cash flows;
•   leverage; and
•   liquidity;
•   evaluate the depth and experience of the tenant's management team; and
•   assess the strength/growth of the tenant's industry.
as a result of the underwriting process, tenants are then categorized into one of three categories:
(1)   acceptable-risk tenants;
(2)   the tenant's credit is such that we may require collateral, in which case we:
54
•   may require a security deposit; and/or
•   may reduce upfront tenant improvement investments; or
(3)   the tenant's credit is below our acceptable parameters.
we consistently monitor the credit quality of our tenant base. we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenant's inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential losses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease.
tenants are assigned a credit rating of 1 through 4. a rating of 1 represents the highest possible rating and no allowance is recorded. a rating of 4 represents the lowest credit rating, in which case we record a full reserve against the receivable and accrued rent balances. among the factors considered in determining the credit rating include:
•   payment history;
•   credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric);
•   change in tenant space needs (i.e., expansion/downsize);
•   tenant financial performance;
•   economic conditions in a specific geographic region; and
•   industry specific credit considerations.
if our estimates of collectability differ from the cash received, the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted. the average remaining term of our in-place tenant leases, including unconsolidated joint ventures, was approximately 7.3 years as of december 31, 2017. the credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of our existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants' risk profiles prior to lease execution and consistent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants.
recoveries from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs, are recognized as revenue in the period during which the expenses are incurred. tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with guidance in asc 605-45 "principal agent considerations" ("asc 605-45"). asc 605-45 requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis, as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk. we also receive reimbursement of payroll and payroll related costs from third parties which we reflect on a net basis.
our parking revenues are derived from leases, monthly parking and transient parking. we recognize parking revenue as earned.
our hotel revenue is derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for telephone service, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services. hotel revenue is recognized as earned.
we receive management and development fees from third parties. property management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management, and not on a straight-line basis, because such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents. we record development fees as earned depending on the risk associated with each project. we recognize development fees earned from joint venture projects equal to its cost plus profit to the extent of the third party partners' ownership interest.
gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions included in asc 360-20 "real estate sales" ("asc 360-20"). the specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in asc 360-20 related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties. if the sales criteria for the full accrual method are not met, we defer some or all of the gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, leasing, profit sharing, deposit, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met.
depreciation and amortization we compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight-line method based on estimated useful asset lives. we allocate the acquisition cost of real estate to its components and depreciate or amortize these assets over their useful lives. the amortization of acquired "above-" and "below-market" leases and
55
acquired in-place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization, respectively, in the consolidated statements of operations.
fair value of financial instruments the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, escrows, receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other assets and liabilities are reasonable estimates of their fair values because of the short maturities of these instruments.
we follow the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements when valuing our financial instruments for disclosure purposes. bplp determine the fair value of its unsecured senior notes using market prices. the inputs used in determining the fair value of bplp's unsecured senior notes is categorized at a level basis (as defined in asc 820 "fair value measurements and disclosures", the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures) due to the fact that we use quoted market rates to value these instruments. however, the inputs used in determining the fair value could be categorized at a level 2 basis (as defined in the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures) if trading volumes are low. we determine the fair value of our mortgage notes payable using discounted cash flow analysis by discounting the spread between the future contractual interest payments and hypothetical future interest payments on mortgage debt based on current market rates for similar securities. in determining the current market rates, we add our estimates of market spreads to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our debt. the inputs used in determining the fair value of our mortgage notes payable and mezzanine notes payable are categorized at a level 3 basis (as defined in the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures) due to the fact that we consider the rates used in the valuation techniques to be unobservable inputs. to the extent that there are outstanding borrowings under the unsecured line of credit, we utilize a discounted cash flow methodology in order to estimate the fair value. to the extent that credit spreads have changed since the origination, the net present value of the difference between future contractual interest payments and future interest payments based on our estimate of a current market rate would represent the difference between the book value and the fair value. our estimate of a current market rate is based upon the rate, considering current market conditions and our specific credit profile, at which we estimate we could obtain similar borrowings. to the extent there are outstanding borrowings, this current market rate is estimated and therefore would be primarily based upon a level 3 input.
derivative instruments and hedging activities derivative instruments and hedging activities require management to make judgments on the nature of its derivatives and their effectiveness as hedges. these judgments determine if the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are reported in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of net income or as a component of comprehensive income and as a component of equity on the consolidated balance sheets. while management believes its judgments are reasonable, a change in a derivative's effectiveness as a hedge could materially affect expenses, net income and equity. we account for the effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative in other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassify the effective portion to earnings over the term that the hedged transaction affects earnings. we account for the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative directly in earnings.

at december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we owned or had interests in a portfolio of 179, 174 and 168 properties, respectively (in each case, the "total property portfolio"). as a result of changes within our total property portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period-to-period. accordingly, we do not believe that our period-to-period financial data with respect to the total property portfolio are necessarily meaningful. therefore, the comparison of operating results for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us and in-service throughout each period compared (the "same property portfolio") and the changes attributable to the properties included in the placed in-service, acquired, development or redevelopment or sold portfolios.
in our analysis of operating results, particularly to make comparisons of net operating income between periods meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in-service and owned by us throughout each period presented. we refer to properties acquired or placed in-service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us and in-service through the end of the latest period presented as our same property portfolio. the same property portfolio therefore excludes properties placed in-service, acquired or in development or redevelopment after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented.

net operating income ("noi") is a non-gaap financial measure equal to net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders, as applicable, the most directly comparable gaap financial measures, plus (1) preferred dividends/distributions, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, losses from interest rate contracts, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment loss, transaction costs and corporate general and administrative expense less (2) gains on sales of real estate, gains (losses) from early extinguishments of debt, gains (losses) from investments in securities, interest and other income, gain on sale of investment in unconsolidated joint venture, income from unconsolidated joint ventures and development and management services revenue. we use noi internally as a performance measure and believe it provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and financial condition because, when compared across periods, it reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders. for example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. similarly, interest expense may be incurred at the property level even though the financing proceeds may be used at the corporate level (e.g., used for other investment activity). in addition, depreciation and amortization expense, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance measures at the property level.
noi presented by us may not be comparable to noi reported by other reits or real estate companies that define noi differently. we believe that, in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, noi should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders as presented in our consolidated financial statements. noi should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders or net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders (determined in accordance with gaap) or any other gaap financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to our financial information prepared in accordance with gaap.
the gains on sales of real estate and depreciation expense may differ between bxp and bplp as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by bxp for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor op unit redemptions by bplp. this accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at bxp that was allocated to certain properties. the difference between the real estate assets of bxp as compared to bplp for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in the gains on sales of real estate and depreciation expense when those properties are sold. for additional information see the explanatory note that follows the cover page of this annual report on form 10-k.
comparison of the year ended december 31, 2017 to the year ended december 31, 2016
the table below shows selected operating information for the same property portfolio and the total property portfolio. the same property portfolio consists of 144 properties totaling approximately 38.7 million net rentable square feet of space, excluding unconsolidated joint ventures. the same property portfolio includes properties acquired or placed in-service on or prior to january 1, 2016 and owned and in service through december 31, 2017. the total property portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either placed in-service, acquired or in development or redevelopment after january 1, 2016 or disposed of on or prior to december 31, 2017. this table includes a reconciliation from the same property portfolio to the total property portfolio by also providing information for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 with respect to the properties which were placed in-service, acquired, in development or redevelopment or sold.

same property portfolio rental revenue rental revenue from the same property portfolio increased by approximately $66.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016. the increase was primarily the result of an increase in revenue from our leases and parking and other income of approximately $62.9 million and $4.6 million, respectively, partially offset by decreases in other recoveries of approximately $0.9 million. rental revenue from our leases increased by approximately $62.9 million as a result of our average revenue per square foot increasing by approximately $1.70, contributing approximately $62.5 million, and an approximately $0.4 million increase due to our average occupancy increasing from 91.53% to 91.54%.
termination income termination income decreased by approximately $35.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016.
termination income for the year ended december 31, 2017 resulted from the termination of 33 tenants across the same property portfolio which totaled approximately $24.5 million of which approximately $21.3 million was attributable to the new york region. the remaining approximately $2.8 million of termination income was primarily related to the washington, dc region. in addition, we received the fifth interim distribution from our unsecured creditor's claim against lehman brothers, inc. of approximately $0.4 million (see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements). recently, claims of similar priority to that of our remaining claim were quoted privately reflecting a value for our remaining claim of approximately $1.0 million; however, there can be no assurance as to the timing or amount of additional proceeds, if any, that we may receive.
termination income for the year ended december 31, 2016 resulted from the termination of 35 tenants across the same property portfolio which totaled approximately $60.2 million of which approximately $58.8 million was from our new york region. on february 3, 2016, we entered into a lease termination agreement with a tenant for an approximately 85,000 square foot lease at our 250 west 55th street property located in new york city.  the lease was scheduled to expire on february 28, 2035.  in consideration for the termination of the lease, the tenant paid us approximately $45.0 million. the remaining approximately $12.4 million of termination income from the new york region was primarily related to negotiated early releases with three other tenants. in addition, during the year ended december 31, 2016, we received the fourth interim distribution from our unsecured creditor's claim against lehman brothers, inc. of approximately $1.4 million.
real estate operating expenses real estate operating expenses from the same property portfolio increased by approximately $30.9 million, or 3.6%, for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016, due primarily to increases in real estate taxes and other real estate operating expenses of approximately $17.8 million, or 4.3% and $13.1 million, or 2.7%, respectively. the increase in real estate taxes was primarily experienced in the new york cbd properties.
properties acquired portfolio the table below lists the properties acquired between january 1, 2016 and december 31, 2017. rental revenue and real estate operating expenses increased by approximately $3.7 million and $1.2 million, respectively for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016, as detailed below.

(1)   average monthly rental rate is calculated as the average of the quotients obtained by dividing (a) rental revenue as determined in accordance with gaap, by (b) the number of occupied units for each month within the applicable fiscal period.
(2)   average physical occupancy is defined as (1) the average number of occupied units divided by (2) the total number of units, expressed as a percentage.
(3)   average economic occupancy is defined as (1) total possible revenue less vacancy loss divided by (2) total possible revenue, expressed as a percentage. total possible revenue is determined by valuing average occupied units at contract rates and average vacant units at market rents. vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current market rents. by measuring vacant units at their market rents, average economic occupancy takes into account the fact that units of different sizes and locations within a residential property have different economic impacts on a residential property's total possible gross revenue. market rents used by us in calculating economic occupancy are based on the current market rates set by the managers of our residential properties based on their experience in renting their residential property's units and publicly available market data. trends in market rents for a region as reported by others could vary. market rents for a period are based on the average market rents during that period and do not reflect any impact for cash concessions.

other operating income and expense items development and management services revenue development and management services revenue increased by approximately $6.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016. development and management services revenue increased by approximately $4.0 million and $2.3 million, respectively. the increase in development revenue is primarily related to an approximately $2.5 million development fee we received as a result of a third-party terminating their development agreement with us. the remaining increase in development revenue was from a third-party development agreement in the boston region and from our unconsolidated joint ventures that are developing dock 72 in brooklyn, new york and the hub on causeway in boston, massachusetts. management services revenue increased primarily due to property management fees we earned from our unconsolidated joint venture, that acquired colorado center in santa monica, california on july 1, 2016, as well as an increase in service income that we earned from our tenants in our new york region. we expect our development and management services revenue to contribute between $29 million and $34 million for 2018.
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased by approximately $8.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to compensation expense and other general and administrative expenses increasing by approximately $7.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively. the increase in compensation expense was primarily related to (1) an approximately $1.4 million increase in the value of our deferred compensation plan, (2) an approximately $2.8 million difference between the unrecognized expense remaining from the 2014 myltip units compared to the expense that was recognized during year ended december 31, 2017 for the 2017 myltip units (see notes 11 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements) and (3) an increase in other compensation related expenses of approximately $3.0 million. the increase in other general and administrative expenses was primarily related to the write-off of the remaining fees associated with bxp's atm stock offering program that was scheduled to expire on june 3, 2017 and an increase in other professional fees. we expect our general and administrative expenses to be between $115 million and $120 million for 2018.
wages directly related to the development and leasing of rental properties are capitalized and included in real estate assets or deferred charges on our consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the applicable asset or lease term. capitalized wages for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $18.6 million and $18.3 million, respectively. these costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above.
transaction costs transaction costs decreased by approximately $1.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016. this decrease was primarily related to the acquisition of 3625-3635 peterson way in santa clara, california, on april 22, 2016, and the acquisition of a 49.8% interest in an existing joint venture that owns and operates colorado center in santa monica, california on july 1, 2016. in general, transaction costs relate to the formation of new and pending joint ventures, pending and completed asset sales and the pursuit of other transactions, including acquisitions are expensed. however, in january 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-01, "business combinations (topic 805): clarifying the definition of a business" and we chose to early adopt it during the first quarter of 2017. we expect that acquisitions of real estate or in-substance real estate will not meet the revised definition of a business because substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets (i.e. land, buildings, and related intangible assets) or because the acquisition does not include a substantive process in the form of an acquired workforce or an acquired contract that cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort or delay (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).

impairment loss on september 27, 2016, we executed a letter of intent for the sale of the remaining parcel of land at our washingtonian north property located in gaithersburg, maryland. the letter of intent caused us to reevaluate our strategy for the land and, based on a shorter than expected hold period, we reduced the carrying value of the land to the estimated net sales price and recognized an impairment loss of approximately $1.8 million during the year ended december 31, 2016.
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation expense may differ between bxp and bplp as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by bxp for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor op unit redemptions by bplp.  this accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at bxp that was allocated to certain properties.  the difference between the real estate assets of bxp as compared to bplp for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in depreciation expense. for additional information see the explanatory note that follows the cover page of this annual report on form 10-k.

(1)   we commenced several repositioning and capital improvement projects during the year ended december 31, 2016 and as a result accelerated depreciation and amortization on the portion of the building that was being repositioned or undergoing capital improvements.
(2)   on august 19, 2016, the consolidated entity in which we have a 55% interest and that owns 601 lexington avenue located in new york city commenced the redevelopment of the six-story, low-rise office and retail building component of the complex. the redeveloped portion of the low-rise building will contain approximately 195,000 net rentable square feet of class a office space and approximately 25,000 net rentable square feet of retail space. we recorded approximately $47.6 million of accelerated depreciation expense for the portion of the complex that was demolished.
other income and expense items income from unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016, income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased by approximately $3.2 million due to an approximately $8.1 million increase in our share of net income which primarily resulted from the joint venture that owns colorado center in santa monica, california and our 901 new york avenue joint venture in washington, dc. these increases were partially offset by an approximately $4.9 million decrease in our share of net income, which primarily resulted from our annapolis junction and market square north joint ventures located in the washington, dc region.
on july 28, 2017, the joint venture that owns colorado center, which we acquired on july 1, 2016, obtained mortgage loan financing, which increased interest expense and reduced the net income for the joint venture. the increase in net income from our 901 new york avenue joint venture was related to our allocation of income and distributions for the year ended december 31, 2017. due to our nominal ownership interest as a result of the achievement of specified investment return thresholds, as provided for in the joint venture agreement, a disproportionate distribution was made by the joint venture to us.
the decrease in our share of net income from our annapolis junction joint venture is primarily due to a decrease in occupancy and an increase in interest expense related to annapolis junction building one's mortgage loan having an event of default and, commencing october 17, 2016, being charged interest at the default interest rate. the decrease in net income from our market square north joint venture was primarily related to an increase in depreciation expense. for additional information pertaining to the annapolis junction building one mortgage loan refer to "item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-capitalization-off-balance sheet arrangements-joint venture indebtedness."
gain on sale of investment in unconsolidated joint venture on october 20, 2016, we and our partner in the unconsolidated joint venture that owns metropolitan square located in washington, dc, completed the sale of an 80% interest in the joint venture for a gross sale price of approximately $282.4 million, including the assumption by the buyer of its pro rata share of the mortgage loan collateralized by the property totaling approximately $133.4 million. in addition, the buyer agreed to assume certain unfunded leasing costs totaling approximately $14.2 million. net proceeds to us totaled approximately $58.2 million, resulting in a gain on sale of investment totaling approximately $59.4 million. prior to the sale, we owned a 51% interest and our partner owned a 49% interest in the joint venture. following the sale, we continue to own a 20% interest in the joint venture with the buyer owning the remaining 80%. metropolitan square is an approximately 607,000 net rentable square foot class a office property.
interest and other income interest and other income decreased by approximately $1.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016 due primarily to a decrease in other income of approximately $2.6 million, partially offset by an increase in interest income of approximately $1.2 million. the decrease in other income was primarily due to an approximately $1.3 million tax credit that we received from our washington, dc region and approximately $1.7 million related to the sale of historic tax credits at the lofts at atlantic wharf in boston, massachusetts, in each case during 2016. neither of these items recurred during 2017. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the income from a purchase rebate program in which we participate.
on october 20, 2010, we closed a transaction with a financial institution (the "htc investor") related to the historic rehabilitation of the lofts at atlantic wharf in boston, massachusetts. the htc investor has contributed an aggregate of approximately $15 million to the project. as part of its contribution, the htc investor received substantially all of the benefits derived from the tax credits. beginning in july 2012 through july 2016, we

recognized the cash received as revenue over the five-year tax credit recapture period as defined in the internal revenue code.
gains from investments in securities gains from investments in securities for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 related to investments that we have made to reduce our market risk relating to a deferred compensation plan that we maintain for bxp's officers. under this deferred compensation plan, each officer who is eligible to participate is permitted to defer a portion of the officer's current income on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on these deferrals based on the performance of specific investments selected by the officer. in order to reduce our market risk relating to this plan, we typically acquire, in a separate account that is not restricted as to its use, similar or identical investments as those selected by each officer. this enables us to generally match our liabilities to officers of bxp under the deferred compensation plan with equivalent assets and thereby limit our market risk. the performance of these investments is recorded as gains from investments in securities. during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, we recognized gains of approximately $3.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively, on these investments. by comparison, our general and administrative expense increased by approximately $3.7 million and $2.3 million during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as a result of increases in our liability under our deferred compensation plan that were associated with the performance of the specific investments selected by officers of bxp participating in the plan.

(3)   includes the repayment of the mortgage loans collateralized fountain square, embarcadero center four and 599 lexington avenue.
(4)   the increase was primarily due to the commencement and continuation of several development projects. for a list of development projects refer to "liquidity and capital resources" within "item 2-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
(5)   the related interest expense from the outside members' notes payable totaled approximately $16.3 million and $34.3 million for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. these amounts are allocated to the outside joint venture partners as an adjustment to noncontrolling interests in property partnerships in our consolidated statements of operations. on june 7, 2017, a portion of the outside members' notes payable was repaid and the remaining portion was contributed as equity in the consolidated entity (see notes 6 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements).
interest expense directly related to the development of rental properties is capitalized and included in real estate assets on our consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate or lease term. as portions of properties are placed in-service, we cease capitalizing interest on that portion and interest is then expensed. interest capitalized for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $61.1 million and $39.2 million, respectively. these costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above.
we estimate net interest expense, which includes debt extinguishment costs, will be between $365 million to $380 million for 2018. these amounts are net of approximately $55 million to $65 million of estimated capitalized interest. the amount of net interest expense depends on a variety of factors, including, among others, the timing of outflows for development costs, the timing of placing developments in service, the amount of interest capitalization and the incurrence of additional debt financings to fund additional investments. in addition, if we refinance, prepay or repurchase existing indebtedness prior to its maturity, we may incur prepayment penalties, and recognize the acceleration of amortized costs. there can be no assurance that our actual interest expense will not differ materially from the estimates above.
at december 31, 2017, our variable rate debt consisted of bplp's $2.0 billion 2017 credit facility, of which $45.0 million was outstanding at december 31, 2017. for a summary of our consolidated debt as of december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016 refer to the heading "liquidity and capital resources-capitalization-debt financing" within "item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
gains (losses) from early extinguishments of debt on december 17, 2017, bplp completed the redemption of $850 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.700% senior notes due november 15, 2018. the redemption price was approximately $865.5 million, which included approximately $2.8 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. excluding the accrued and unpaid interest, the redemption price was approximately 101.49% of the principal amount being redeemed. we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $13.9 million, which amount included the payment of the redemption premium totaling approximately $12.7 million.
on june 7, 2017, our consolidated entity in which we have a 60% ownership interest and that owns 767 fifth avenue (the general motors building) located in new york city completed the refinancing of approximately $1.6 billion of indebtedness that had been secured by direct and indirect interests in 767 fifth avenue. the new mortgage financing has a principal amount of $2.3 billion, bears interest at a fixed interest rate of 3.43% per annum and matures on june 9, 2027. the loan requires monthly interest-only payments during the 10-year term of the loan, with the entire principal amount due at maturity. the extinguished debt bore interest at a weighted-average rate of approximately 5.96% per annum, an effective gaap interest rate of approximately 3.03% per annum and was scheduled to mature on october 7, 2017. there was no prepayment penalty associated with the repayment of the prior indebtedness. we recognized a net gain from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $14.6 million primarily consisting of the acceleration of the remaining balance related to the historical fair value debt adjustment.
on april 24, 2017, bplp entered into the 2017 credit facility (see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). certain lenders, under the prior credit facility, chose to not participate in the 2017 credit facility and as such we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.3 million related to the acceleration of finance fees associated with the prior credit agreement.

on september 1, 2016, we used a portion of the net proceeds from bplp's august 2016 offering of senior unsecured notes and available cash to repay the mortgage loan collateralized by our 599 lexington avenue property located in new york city totaling $750.0 million. the mortgage loan bore interest at a fixed rate of 5.57% per annum (5.41% per annum including the impact of financing costs and interest rate hedges) and was scheduled to mature on march 1, 2017. there was no prepayment penalty. we recognized a gain from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.4 million consisting of the acceleration of the remaining balance related to the effective portion of a previous interest rate hedging program included within accumulated other comprehensive loss, offset by the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.
on september 1, 2016, we used a portion of the net proceeds from bplp's august 2016 offering of senior unsecured notes and available cash to repay the mortgage loan collateralized by our embarcadero center four property located in san francisco, california totaling approximately $344.8 million. the mortgage loan bore interest at a fixed rate of 6.10% per annum (7.02% per annum including the impact of financing costs and interest rate hedges) and was scheduled to mature on december 1, 2016. there was no prepayment penalty. we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.7 million consisting of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and the acceleration of the remaining balance related to the effective portion of a previous interest rate hedging program included within accumulated other comprehensive loss.
losses from interest rate contracts on august 17, 2016, in conjunction with bplp's offering of senior unsecured notes, we terminated forward-starting interest rate swap contracts that fixed the 10-year swap rate at a weighted-average rate of approximately 2.423% per annum on notional amounts aggregating $550.0 million. we cash-settled the contracts and made cash payments to the counterparties aggregating approximately $49.3 million. we recognized approximately $0.1 million of losses on interest rate contracts during the year ended december 31, 2016 related to the partial ineffectiveness of the interest rate contracts. we will reclassify into earnings, as an increase to interest expense, approximately $49.2 million (or approximately $4.9 million per year over the 10-year term of the 2.750% senior unsecured notes due 2026) of the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets within accumulated other comprehensive loss, which represents the effective portion of the applicable interest rate contracts.
gains on sales of real estate the gains on sales of real estate may differ between bxp and bplp as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by bxp for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor op unit redemptions by bplp. this accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at bxp that was allocated to certain properties. the difference between the real estate assets of bxp as compared to bplp for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in the gains on sales of real estate when those properties are sold. for additional information see the explanatory note that follows the cover page of this annual report on form 10-k.

(2)   on june 7, 2017, our consolidated entity in which we have a 60% interest completed the refinancing of indebtedness that had been secured by direct and indirect interests in 767 fifth avenue. the net loss allocation was primarily due to the partners' share of the interest expense for the outside members' notes payable which was $16.3 million and $34.3 million for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. on june 7, 2017, a portion of the outside members' notes payable was repaid and the remaining portion was contributed as equity in the consolidated entity (see notes 6 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements).
(3)   on august 19, 2016, the consolidated entity in which we have a 55% interest and that owns this property commenced the redevelopment of the six-story low-rise office and retail building component of the complex. the redeveloped portion of the low-rise building will contain approximately 195,000 net rentable square feet of class a office space and approximately 25,000 net rentable square feet of retail space. we will capitalize incremental costs during the redevelopment. bxp and bplp recognized approximately $50.8 million and $47.6 million, respectively, of depreciation expense associated with the acceleration of depreciation on the assets being removed from service and demolished as part of the redevelopment of the property. approximately $21.4 million of those amounts was allocated to the outside partners.
noncontrolling interest-common units of the operating partnership for bxp, noncontrolling interest-common units of the operating partnership decreased by approximately $7.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to 2016 due primarily to a decreases in allocable income, which was the result of recognizing a greater gain on sales of real estate amount during 2016 and a decrease in the noncontrolling interest's ownership percentage. due to our ownership structure, there is no corresponding line item on bplp's financial statements.

same property portfolio rental revenue rental revenue from the same property portfolio increased by approximately $35.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 2015. the increase was primarily the result of an increase in revenue from our leases of approximately $38.4 million partially offset by decreases in other recoveries and parking and other income of approximately $1.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively. rental revenue from our leases increased by approximately $38.4 million as a result of our average revenue per square foot increasing by approximately $1.92, contributing approximately $66.0 million partially, offset by an approximately $27.6 million decrease due to a reduction in our average occupancy from 92.0% to 91.4%.
termination income termination income increased by approximately $19.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 2015.
termination income for the year ended december 31, 2016 resulted from the termination of 35 tenants across the same property portfolio which totaled approximately $60.2 million of which approximately $58.8 million was from our new york region. on february 3, 2016, we entered into a lease termination agreement with a tenant for an approximately 85,000 square foot lease at our 250 west 55th street property located in new york city.  the lease was scheduled to expire on february 28, 2035.  in consideration for the termination of the lease, the tenant paid us approximately $45.0 million. the remaining approximately $12.4 million of termination income from the new york region was primarily related to negotiated early releases with three other tenants. in addition, during the year ended december 31, 2016, we received the fourth interim distribution from our unsecured creditor claim again lehman brothers, inc. of approximately $1.4 million.
termination income for the year ended december 31, 2015 resulted from the termination of 32 tenants across the same property portfolio which totaled approximately $40.6 million of which approximately $32.5 million, $6.4 million, $1.2 million and $0.5 million related to early terminations in our new york, san francisco, boston and washington, dc regions, respectively. the termination income from the new york region was primarily due to distributions we received from our unsecured creditor claim against lehman brothers, inc. (see below) and our negotiated early terminations of a tenant at 767 fifth avenue (the general motors building), two tenants at 601 lexington avenue and a tenant in princeton, new jersey each in order to accommodate leasing the space to other tenants. approximately $7.0 million of our termination income for the year ended december 31, 2015 was non-cash and resulted from the acceleration of "above-" and "below-market" lease revenue and straight-line rent adjustments.
on march 11, 2015 and september 9, 2015, we received the second and third interim distributions from our unsecured creditor claim against lehman brothers, inc. aggregating approximately $8.1 million.
real estate operating expenses real estate operating expenses from the same property portfolio increased by approximately $20.1 million, or 2.4%, for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 2015, due primarily to an increase of approximately $21.0 million, or 5.4%, in real estate taxes, which we primarily experienced in the new york cbd properties partially offset by a decrease in other real estate operating expenses of approximately $0.9 million, or 0.2%.

(1)   average monthly rental rate is calculated as the average of the quotients obtained by dividing (a) rental revenue as determined in accordance with gaap, by (b) the number of occupied units for each month within the applicable fiscal period.
(2)   average physical occupancy is defined as (1) the average number of occupied units divided by (2) the total number of units, expressed as a percentage.
(3)   average economic occupancy is defined as (1) total possible revenue less vacancy loss divided by (2) total possible revenue, expressed as a percentage. total possible revenue is determined by valuing average occupied units at contract rates and average vacant units at market rents. vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current market rents. by measuring vacant units at their market rents, average economic occupancy takes into account the fact that units of different sizes and locations within a residential property have different economic impacts on a residential property's total possible gross revenue. market rents used by us in calculating economic occupancy are
77
based on the current market rates set by the managers of our residential properties based on their experience in renting their residential property's units and publicly available market data. trends in market rents for a region as reported by others could vary. market rents for a period are based on the average market rents during that period and do not reflect any impact for cash concessions.

other operating income and expense items development and management services revenue development and management services revenue increased by approximately $5.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 2015. development service income increased by approximately $2.5 million and management service income increased by approximately $3.2 million. the increase in development service income is primarily due to increases in development fees from our boston and new york unconsolidated joint ventures, as well as an increase in our san francisco third-party development fees, partially offset by a decrease in development fees from our washington, dc third-party developments and unconsolidated joint ventures. management service income increased primarily due to management fees and leasing commissions. the increase in management fees was primarily due to the fees we earned from our colorado center joint venture, which we acquired on july 1, 2016, in santa monica, california. the increase in leasing commissions was related to a commission we earned on a lease that was extended at one of our third party managed buildings in new york city.
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased by approximately $8.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to an approximately $8.9 million increase in overall compensation expense. the increase in compensation expense was primarily due to the following items: (1) approximately $3.7 million related to the difference between the unrecognized expense remaining from the 2013 myltip units compared to the expense that was recognized during the year ended december 31, 2016 for the newly issued 2016 myltip units, (2) an approximately $2.9 million increase in the value of bxp's deferred compensation plan and (3) an approximately $2.3 million increase in other compensation expenses.
wages directly related to the development and leasing of rental properties are capitalized and included in real estate assets or deferred charges on our consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the applicable asset or lease term. capitalized wages for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $18.3 million and $15.9 million, respectively. these costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above.
transaction costs transaction costs increased by approximately $1.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 2015 due to the write off of approximately $1.0 million of costs related to the unsuccessful pursuit of a development opportunity in cambridge, massachusetts. in general, transaction costs relate to the formation of new and pending joint ventures, pending and completed asset sales and the pursuit of other transactions, including acquisitions are expensed (refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).

impairment loss on september 27, 2016, we executed a letter of intent for the sale of the remaining parcel of land at our washingtonian north property located in gaithersburg, maryland. the letter of intent caused us to reevaluate our strategy for the land and, based on a shorter than expected hold period, we reduced the carrying value of the land to the estimated net sales price and recognized an impairment loss of approximately $1.8 million during the year ended december 31, 2016.
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation expense may differ between bxp and bplp as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by bxp for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor op unit redemptions by bplp.  this accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at bxp that was allocated to certain properties.  the difference between the real estate assets of bxp as compared to bplp for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in depreciation expense. for additional information see the explanatory note that follows the cover page of this annual report on form 10-k.

(1)   on august 19, 2016, the consolidated entity in which we have a 55% interest and that owns 601 lexington avenue located in new york city commenced the redevelopment of the six-story, low-rise office and retail building component of
79
the complex. the redeveloped portion of the low-rise building will contain approximately 195,000 net rentable square feet of class a office space and approximately 25,000 net rentable square feet of retail space. we recorded approximately $47.6 million of accelerated depreciation expense for the portion of the complex that was demolished.
other income and expense items income from unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 2015, income from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased by approximately $14.7 million due primarily to an approximately $12.4 million decrease in our share of net income from 901 new york avenue in washington, dc. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we received a distribution of approximately $24.5 million, which was generated from the excess loan proceeds from the joint venture's refinancing of its mortgage loan to a new 10-year mortgage loan totaling $225.0 million. our allocation of income and distributions for the year ended december 31, 2015 was not proportionate to our nominal ownership interest as a result of the achievement of specified investment return thresholds, as provided for in the joint venture agreement. in addition, we had an approximately $4.3 million and $0.7 million decrease in our share of net income from our annapolis junction joint venture and metropolitan square joint venture, respectively. the decrease for metropolitan square is documented below under the heading "gain on sale of investment in unconsolidated joint venture." the decrease in our share of net income from the annapolis junction joint venture is primarily due to an increase in interest expense related to annapolis junction building one having an event of default and as of october 17, 2016 the property was being charged interest at the default interest rate. also, annapolis junction building seven and building eight had construction loans and, therefore, the venture capitalized the interest and did not expense it during the development period in 2015. in addition, there was an increase in depreciation and amortization expense as a result of annapolis junction building seven and building eight no longer being in development for the entire year ended december 31, 2016. these decreases were partially offset by the acquisition of colorado center located in santa monica, california and the placing in-service of 1265 main street in waltham, massachusetts.
gain on sale of investment in unconsolidated joint venture on october 20, 2016, we and our partner in the unconsolidated joint venture that owns metropolitan square located in washington, dc, completed the sale of an 80% interest in the joint venture for a gross sale price of approximately $282.4 million, including the assumption by the buyer of its pro rata share of the mortgage loan collateralized by the property totaling approximately $133.4 million. in addition, the buyer agreed to assume certain unfunded leasing costs totaling approximately $14.2 million. net proceeds to us totaled approximately $58.2 million, resulting in a gain on sale of investment totaling approximately $59.4 million. prior to the sale, we owned a 51% interest and our partner owned a 49% interest in the joint venture. following the sale, we continue to own a 20% interest in the joint venture with the buyer owning the remaining 80%. metropolitan square is an approximately 607,000 net rentable square foot class a office property.
interest and other income interest and other income increased by approximately $0.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to a purchase rebate program in which we participated.
gains (losses) from investments in securities gains (losses) from investments in securities for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 related to investments that we have made to reduce our market risk relating to a deferred compensation plan that we maintain for bxp's officers. under this deferred compensation plan, each officer who is eligible to participate is permitted to defer a portion of the officer's current income on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on these deferrals based on the performance of specific investments selected by the officer. in order to reduce our market risk relating to this plan, we typically acquire, in a separate account that is not restricted as to its use, similar or identical investments as those selected by each officer. this enables us to generally match our liabilities to officers of bxp under the deferred compensation plan with equivalent assets and thereby limit our market risk. the performance of these investments is recorded as gains (losses) from investments in securities. during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized gains (losses) of approximately $2.3 million and $(0.7) million, respectively, on these investments. by comparison, our general and administrative expense increased (decreased) by approximately $2.3 million and $(0.6) million during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively,

as a result of increases (decreases) in our liability under our deferred compensation plan that were associated with the performance of the specific investments selected by officers of bxp participating in the plan.

_______________
(1)   the related interest expense from the outside members' notes payable totaled approximately $34.3 million and $30.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. these amounts are allocated to the outside joint venture partners as an adjustment to noncontrolling interests in property partnerships in our consolidated statements of operations.
(2)   includes the repayment of kingstowne two and kingstowne retail, fountain square, embarcadero center four and 599 lexington avenue.
(3)   the increase was primarily due to the commencement and continuation of several development projects. for a list of development projects refer to "liquidity and capital resources" within "item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
interest expense directly related to the development of rental properties is capitalized and included in real estate assets on our consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate or lease term. as portions of properties are placed in-service, we cease capitalizing interest on that portion and interest is then expensed. interest capitalized for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $39.2 million and $34.2 million, respectively. these costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above.
at december 31, 2016, our variable rate debt consisted of bplp's $1.0 billion unsecured line of credit, of which no amount was outstanding at december 31, 2016. for a summary of our consolidated debt as of december 31, 2016 refer to the heading "liquidity and capital resources-capitalization-debt financing" within "item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."

losses from early extinguishments of debt on september 1, 2016, we used a portion of the net proceeds from bplp's august 2016 offering of senior unsecured notes (see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements) and available cash to repay the mortgage loan collateralized by our 599 lexington avenue property located in new york city totaling $750.0 million. the mortgage loan bore interest at a fixed rate of 5.57% per annum (5.41% per annum including the impact of financing costs and interest rate hedges) and was scheduled to mature on march 1, 2017. there was no prepayment penalty. we recognized a gain from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.4 million consisting of the acceleration of the remaining balance related to the effective portion of a previous interest rate hedging program included within accumulated other comprehensive loss, offset by the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.
on september 1, 2016, we used a portion of the net proceeds from bplp's august 2016 offering of senior unsecured notes (see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements) and available cash to repay the mortgage loan collateralized by our embarcadero center four property located in san francisco, california totaling approximately $344.8 million. the mortgage loan bore interest at a fixed rate of 6.10% per annum (7.02% per annum including the impact of financing costs and interest rate hedges) and was scheduled to mature on december 1, 2016. there was no prepayment penalty. we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.7 million consisting of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and the acceleration of the remaining balance related to the effective portion of a previous interest rate hedging program included within accumulated other comprehensive loss.
on december 15, 2015, we legally defeased the mortgage loan collateralized by our 100 & 200 clarendon street properties located in boston, massachusetts. the mortgage loan had an outstanding principal balance of $640.5 million, bore interest at a fixed rate of 5.68% per annum and was scheduled to mature on january 6, 2017. the cash outlay required for the defeasance in the net amount of approximately $667.3 million was based on the purchase price of u.s. government securities that will generate sufficient cash flow to fund continued interest payments on the loan from the effective date of the defeasance through, and the repayment of the loan on, october 6, 2016, which is the date on which we could repay the loan at par. in connection with the defeasance, the mortgage and other liens on the property were extinguished and all existing collateral, including various guarantees, were released. as a result of the defeasance, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $22.0 million, consisting of approximately $26.8 million, which is the difference between the purchase price for the u.s. government securities acquired for the defeasance and the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loan, and approximately $1.4 million of unamortized deferred financing costs, offset by approximately $4.8 million from the acceleration of the remaining balance of the historical fair value debt adjustment and approximately $1.4 million of accrued interest expense through the effective date of the defeasance.
losses from interest rate contracts on august 17, 2016, in conjunction with bplp's offering of senior unsecured notes, we terminated forward-starting interest rate swap contracts that fixed the 10-year swap rate at a weighted-average rate of approximately 2.423% per annum on notional amounts aggregating $550.0 million. we cash-settled the contracts and made cash payments to the counterparties aggregating approximately $49.3 million. we recognized approximately $0.1 million of losses on interest rate contracts during the year ended december 31, 2016 related to the partial ineffectiveness of the interest rate contracts. we will reclassify into earnings, as an increase to interest expense, approximately $49.2 million (or approximately $4.9 million per year over the 10-year term of the 2.750% senior unsecured notes due 2026) of the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets within accumulated other comprehensive loss, which represents the effective portion of the applicable interest rate contracts.
gains on sales of real estate the gains on sales of real estate may differ between bxp and bplp as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by bxp for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor op unit redemptions by bplp. this accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at bxp that was allocated to certain properties. the difference between the real estate assets of bxp as compared to bplp for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in the gains on sales of real estate when those properties are sold. for additional information see the explanatory note that follows the cover page of this annual report on form 10-k.

_______________
(1)   on september 18, 2015, we sold this property and approximately $101.1 million of the gain was allocated to the outside partners (see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements).
(2)   on september 15, 2015, we acquired our partners' nominal 50% interest (see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements).
84
(3)   the net loss allocation is primarily due to the partners' share of the interest expense for the outside members' notes payable which was $34.3 million and $30.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
(4)   on august 19, 2016, the consolidated entity in which we have a 55% interest and that owns this property commenced the redevelopment of the six-story, low-rise office and retail building component of the complex. the redeveloped portion of the low-rise building will contain approximately 195,000 net rentable square feet of class a office space and approximately 25,000 net rentable square feet of retail space. we will capitalize incremental costs during the redevelopment. bxp and bplp recognized approximately $50.8 million and $47.6 million, respectively, of depreciation expense associated with the acceleration of depreciation on the assets being removed from service and demolished as part of the redevelopment of the property. approximately $21.4 million of those amounts was allocated to the outside partners.
noncontrolling interest-common units of the operating partnership for bxp, noncontrolling interest-common units of the operating partnership decreased by approximately $7.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to a decrease in allocable income, which was the result of recognizing a greater gain on sales of real estate amount during 2015, partially offset by an increase in the noncontrolling interest's ownership percentage. due to our ownership structure, there is no corresponding line item on bplp's financial statements.
85
liquidity and capital resources general our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond are to fund:
•   normal recurring expenses;
•   meet debt service and principal repayment obligations, including balloon payments on maturing debt;
•   capital expenditures, including major renovations, tenant improvements and leasing costs;
•   development costs;
•   dividend requirements on bxp's series b preferred stock;
•   possible acquisitions of properties, either directly or indirectly through the acquisition of equity interests therein; and
•   make the minimum distribution required to enable bxp to maintain its reit qualification under the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended.
we expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following:
•   cash flow from operations;
•   distribution of cash flows from joint ventures;
•   cash and cash equivalent balances;
•   issuances of bxp equity securities and/or additional preferred or common units of partnership interest in bplp;
•   bplp's 2017 credit facility and other short-term bridge facilities;
•   construction loans;
•   long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness (including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness); and
•   sales of real estate.
we draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long-term capital needs. our current development properties are expected to be primarily funded with our available cash balances, construction loans and bplp's 2017 credit facility. we use bplp's 2017 credit facility primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, refinance outstanding indebtedness and meet short-term development and working capital needs. although we may seek to fund our development projects with construction loans, which may require guarantees by bplp, the financing for each particular project ultimately depends on several factors, including, among others, the project's size and duration, the extent of pre-leasing and our available cash and access to cost effective capital at the given time.

(4)   under the joint venture agreement, if the project is funded with 100% equity, we have agreed to fund 50% of our partner's equity requirement, structured as preferred equity. we expect to fund approximately $25.4 million at a rate of libor plus 3.0% per annum and receive priority distributions from all distributions to our partner until the principal and interest are repaid. as of december 31, 2017, we had contributed an aggregate of approximately $16.4 million of preferred equity to the venture. this property was 7% placed in-service.

contractual rental revenue, recoveries from tenants, other income from operations, available cash balances, mortgage financings and draws on bplp's 2017 credit facility are the principal sources of capital that we use to fund operating expenses, debt service, maintenance and repositioning capital expenditures, tenant improvements and the minimum distribution required to enable bxp to maintain its reit qualification. we seek to maximize income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. our sources of revenue also include third-party fees generated by our property management, leasing and development and construction businesses, as well as the sale of assets from time to time. we believe our revenue, together with our cash balances and proceeds from financing activities, will continue to provide the funds necessary for our short-term liquidity needs, including our properties under development and redevelopment.
material adverse changes in one or more sources of capital may adversely affect our net cash flows. in turn, these changes could adversely affect our ability to fund operating expenses, dividends and distributions, debt service payments, maintenance and repositioning capital expenditures and tenant improvements. in addition, a material adverse change in the cash provided by our operations may affect our ability to comply with the financial covenants under bplp's 2017 credit facility and unsecured senior notes.
our primary uses of capital will be the completion of our current development and redevelopment projects. as of december 31, 2017, our share of the remaining development and redevelopment costs that we expect to fund through 2022 is approximately $1.5 billion.
with approximately $301 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately $1.8 billion available under the 2017 credit facility, in each case, as of february 22, 2018, we have sufficient capital to complete these projects. we believe that our strong liquidity, including our availability under bplp's 2017 credit facility, and proceeds from debt financings and asset sales provide sufficient liquidity to fund our remaining capital requirements on existing development and redevelopment projects and pursue additional attractive investment opportunities. in addition, on june 2, 2017 we renewed bxp's $600 million atm stock offering program for a period of three years. we have not sold any shares under this atm stock offering program. during the fourth quarter, we reduced our overall borrowing cost and extended our debt maturities by refinancing $850 million of 3.700% senior notes that were scheduled to mature on november 15, 2018 with the proceeds from the issuance of $850 million of 3.200% senior notes maturing january 2025.
given the relatively low interest rates currently available to us in the debt markets, we may seek to enhance our liquidity to provide sufficient capacity to meet our debt obligations and to fund our remaining capital requirements on existing development projects, our foreseeable potential development activity and pursue attractive additional investment opportunities. depending on interest rates and overall conditions in the debt markets, we may decide to access the debt markets in advance of the need for the funds. doing so may result in us carrying additional cash and cash equivalents pending bplp's use of the proceeds, and it would be dilutive to our earnings by increasing our net interest expense.

reit tax distribution considerations dividend bxp as a reit is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that bxp currently distribute at least 90% of its annual taxable income (excluding capital gains and with certain other adjustments). our policy is for bxp to distribute at least 100% of its taxable income, including capital gains, to avoid paying federal tax. on december 18, 2017, the board of directors of bxp increased our regular quarterly dividend to $0.80 per common share. common and ltip unitholders of limited partnership interest in bplp, as of the close of business on december 29, 2017, received the same total distribution per unit, on january 30, 2018.
bxp's board of directors will continue to evaluate bxp's dividend rate in light of our actual and projected taxable income, liquidity requirements and other circumstances, and there can be no assurance that the future dividends declared by its board of directors will not differ materially.
sales to the extent that we sell assets at a gain and cannot efficiently use the proceeds in a tax deferred manner for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions, bxp would, at the appropriate time, decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend, adopt a stock repurchase program, reduce our indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities. such a decision will depend on many factors including, among others, the timing, availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities, our then-current and anticipated leverage, the cost and availability of capital from other sources, the price of bxp's common stock and reit distribution requirements. at a minimum, we expect that bxp would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for bxp to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales.
cash flow summary the following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below.
cash and cash equivalents were approximately $434.8 million and $356.9 million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing an increase of approximately $77.9 million. the following table sets forth changes in cash flows:

our principal source of cash flow is related to the operation of our properties. the average term of our in-place tenant leases, including our unconsolidated joint ventures, is approximately 7.3 years with occupancy rates historically in the range of 90% to 94%. our properties generate a relatively consistent stream of cash flow that provides us with resources to pay operating expenses, debt service and fund regular quarterly dividend and distribution payment requirements. in addition, over the past several years, we have raised capital through the sale of some of our properties, secured and unsecured borrowings and equity offerings of bxp.
cash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development, net investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and maintenance and repositioning capital expenditures. we selectively invest in new projects that enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing and property management skills and invest in existing buildings to enhance or maintain their market position. cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2017 consisted primarily of development projects, building and tenant improvements and capital contributions and distributions to/from unconsolidated joint ventures. cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2016 consisted primarily of development projects, tenant improvements and capital contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of real estate as detailed below:

consolidated debt to consolidated market capitalization ratio is a measure of leverage commonly used by analysts in the reit sector. we present this measure as a percentage and it is calculated by dividing (a) our consolidated debt by (b) our consolidated market capitalization, which is the market value of our outstanding equity securities plus our consolidated debt. consolidated market capitalization is the sum of:
(1) our consolidated debt; plus
(2) the product of (x) the closing price per share of bxp common stock on december 29, 2017, as reported by the new york stock exchange, multiplied by (y) the sum of:
(i)   the number of outstanding shares of common stock of bxp,
(ii)   the number of outstanding op units in bplp (excluding op units held by bxp),
(iii)   the number of op units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding ltip units, assuming all conditions have been met for the conversion of the ltip units, and
(iv)   the number of op units issuable upon conversion of 2012 opp units, 2013 myltip units and 2014 myltip units that were issued in the form of ltip units; plus
(3) the aggregate liquidation preference ($2,500 per share) of the outstanding shares of bxp's 5.25% series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock.
the calculation of consolidated market capitalization does not include ltip units issued in the form of myltip awards unless and until certain performance thresholds are achieved and they are earned. because their three-year performance periods had not yet ended as of december 31, 2017, 2015, 2016 and 2017 myltip units (see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements) are not included in this calculation.
92
we also present bxp's share of market capitalization, which is calculated in the same manner, except that bxp's share of debt is utilized instead of our consolidated debt in both the numerator and the denominator. bxp's share of debt is defined as our consolidated debt plus our share of debt from our unconsolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon our ownership percentage), minus our partners' share of debt from our consolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon the partners' percentage ownership interests). management believes that bxp's share of debt provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition because it includes our share of debt from unconsolidated joint ventures and excludes our partners' share of debt from consolidated joint ventures, in each case presented on the same basis. we have several significant joint ventures and presenting various measures of financial condition in this manner can help investors better understand our financial condition and/or results of operations after taking into account our economic interest in these joint ventures.  we caution investors that the ownership percentages used in calculating bxp's share of debt may not completely and accurately depict all of the legal and economic implications of holding an interest in a consolidated or unconsolidated joint venture. for example, in addition to partners' interests in profits and capital, venture agreements vary in the allocation of rights regarding decision making (both for routine and major decisions), distributions, transferability of interests, liquidations and other matters.  moreover, in some cases we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, the joint venture in which case gaap requires that we account for the joint venture entity using the equity method of accounting and we do not consolidate it for financial reporting purposes. as a result, presentations of bxp's share of a financial measure should be considered with and as a supplement to our financial information presented in accordance with gaap.
we present these supplemental ratios because our degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes and because different investors and lenders consider one or both of these ratios. investors should understand that these ratios are, in part, a function of the market price of the common stock of bxp and as such will fluctuate with changes in such price, and they do not necessarily reflect our capacity to incur additional debt to finance our activities or our ability to manage our existing debt obligations. however, for a company like bxp, whose assets are primarily income-producing real estate, these ratios may provide investors with an alternate indication of leverage, so long as they are evaluated along with the ratio of indebtedness to other measures of asset value used by financial analysts and other financial ratios, as well as the various components of our outstanding indebtedness.
for a discussion of our unconsolidated joint venture indebtedness, see "liquidity and capital resources-capitalization-off-balance sheet arrangements-joint venture indebtedness" within "item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations." and for a discussion of our consolidated joint venture indebtedness see "liquidity and capital resources-capitalization-mortgage notes payable, net" and "-mezzanine notes payable" and "outside members' notes payable" within "item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
debt financing as of december 31, 2017, we had approximately $10.3 billion of outstanding consolidated indebtedness, representing approximately 31.29% of our consolidated market capitalization as calculated above consisting of approximately (1) $7.247 billion (net of discount) in publicly traded unsecured senior notes having a gaap weighted-average interest rate of 4.15% per annum and maturities in 2019 through 2026, (2) $3.0 billion of property-specific mortgage debt having a gaap weighted-average interest rate of 3.95% per annum and weighted-average term of 8.2 years and (3) $45.0 million outstanding under bplp's 2017 credit facility that matures on april 24, 2022.

(1)   gaap interest rate differs from the stated interest rate due to the inclusion of the amortization of financing charges and the effects of hedging transactions.
(2)   the mortgage loan requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity.
(3)   this property is owned by a consolidated entity in which we have a 60% interest.

market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. our primary market risk results from our indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and variable rates. the fair value of our debt obligations are affected by changes in the market interest rates. we manage our market risk by matching long-term leases with long-term, fixed-rate, non-recourse debt of similar duration. we continue to follow a conservative strategy of generally pre-leasing development projects on a long-term basis to creditworthy tenants in order to achieve the most favorable construction and permanent financing terms. approximately 99.6% of our outstanding debt, excluding our unconsolidated joint ventures, has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the interest rate risk through the maturity of such outstanding debt. we also manage our market risk by entering into hedging arrangements with financial institutions. our primary objectives when undertaking hedging transactions and derivative positions is to reduce our floating rate exposure and to fix a portion of the interest rate for anticipated financing and refinancing transactions. this in turn, reduces the risks that the variability of cash flows imposes on variable rate debt. our strategy mitigates against future increases in our interest rates.
at december 31, 2017, our weighted-average coupon/stated rate on our fixed rate outstanding consolidated debt was 3.98% per annum. at december 31, 2017, we had $45.0 million outstanding of consolidated variable rate debt. at december 31, 2017, the gaap interest rate on our variable rate debt was approximately 2.46%. if market interest rates on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest expense would have increased approximately $450,000 for the year ended december 31, 2017.
funds from operations pursuant to the revised definition of funds from operations adopted by the board of governors of nareit we calculate funds from operations, or "ffo," for each of bxp and bplp by adjusting net income (loss) attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income (loss) attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders, respectively, (computed in accordance with gaap) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, impairment losses on depreciable real estate consolidated on our balance sheet, impairment losses on our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures and our share of real estate-related depreciation and amortization. ffo is a non-gaap financial measure, but we believe the presentation of ffo, combined with the presentation of required gaap financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and has helped make comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful. management generally considers ffo to be useful measures for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), ffo can help
96
investors compare the operating performance of a company's real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies.
our computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently. we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership as presented in our consolidated financial statements. ffo should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders or net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders (determined in accordance with gaap) or any other gaap financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to our financial information prepared in accordance with gaap.

net operating income ("noi") is a non-gaap financial measure equal to net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders, as applicable, the most directly comparable gaap financial measures, plus (1) preferred dividends/distributions, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, impairment loss, losses from interest rate contracts, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, transaction costs and corporate general and administrative expense less (2) discontinued operations, gains on sales of real estate, gains (losses) from early extinguishments of debt, gains (losses) from investments in securities, interest and other income, gains on consolidation of joint ventures, gain on sale of investment in unconsolidated joint venture, income from unconsolidated joint ventures and development and management services revenue. we use noi internally as a performance measure and believe it provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and financial condition because, when compared across periods, it reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders. for

example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. similarly, interest expense may be incurred at the property level even though the financing proceeds may be used at the corporate level (e.g., used for other investment activity). in addition, depreciation and amortization expense, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance measures at the property level.
noi presented by us may not be comparable to noi reported by other reits or real estate companies that define noi differently. we believe that, in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, noi should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders and net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders as presented in our consolidated financial statements. noi should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to boston properties, inc. common shareholders or net income attributable to boston properties limited partnership common unitholders (determined in accordance with gaap) or any other gaap financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to our financial information prepared in accordance with gaap.

(1)   amounts include principal and interest payments.
(2)   interest payments are calculated using the december 31, 2017 interest rate of 2.35%.
(3)   committed tenant-related obligations based on executed leases as of december 31, 2017 (tenant improvements and lease commissions).
(4)   includes 100% of the obligations for our consolidated entities and only our share for the unconsolidated joint ventures.
we have various service contracts with vendors related to our property management. in addition, we have certain other contracts we enter into in the ordinary course of business that may extend beyond one year. these contracts include terms that provide for cancellation with insignificant or no cancellation penalties. contract terms are generally between three and five years.
during 2017, we paid approximately $309.8 million to fund tenant-related obligations, including tenant improvements and leasing commissions, and incurred approximately $323 million of new tenant-related obligations associated with approximately 4.0 million square feet of second generation leases, or approximately $80 per square foot. in addition, we signed leases for approximately 2.4 million square feet at our development properties. the tenant-related obligations for the development properties are included within the projects' "estimated total investment" referred to in "item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
106
operations-liquidity and capital resources." in the aggregate, during 2017, we signed leases for approximately 6.4 million square feet of space and incurred aggregate tenant-related obligations of approximately $698 million, or approximately $108 per square foot.
off-balance sheet arrangements-joint venture indebtedness we have investments in unconsolidated joint ventures with our effective ownership interests ranging from 20% to 60%. ten of these joint ventures have mortgage indebtedness. we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities and therefore they are presently accounted for using the equity method of accounting. see also note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. at december 31, 2017, the aggregate carrying amount of debt, including both our and our partners' share, incurred by these ventures was approximately $1.4 billion (of which our proportionate share is approximately $604.8 million). the table below summarizes the outstanding debt of these joint venture properties at december 31, 2017. from time to time, we (or the applicable joint venture) have also agreed to guarantee portions of the principal, interest or other amounts in connection with other unconsolidated joint venture borrowings. in addition, we have agreed to customary construction completion guarantees for construction loans, environmental indemnifications and nonrecourse carve-outs (e.g., guarantees against fraud, misrepresentation and bankruptcy) on certain of the loans.

_______________
(1)   gaap interest rate differs from the stated interest rate due to the inclusion of the amortization of financing charges.
(2)   the loan requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity.
(3)   mortgage loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to libor plus 1.50% per annum.
(4)   on april 11, 2016, a notice of event of default was received from the lender because the loan to value ratio was not in compliance with the applicable covenant in the loan agreement. on october 17, 2016, the lender notified the joint venture that it has elected to charge the default rate on the loan. the default rate is defined as libor plus 5.75% per annum. subsequently, the cash flows generated from the property have become insufficient to fund debt service payments and capital improvements necessary to lease and operate the property and the joint venture is not prepared to fund additional cash shortfalls at this time. consequently, the
107
joint venture is not current on making debt service payments and remains in default. the loan has one, three-year extension option, subject to certain conditions including that no event of default exists or is ongoing.
(5)   the loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to libor plus 2.25% per annum.

(8)   the construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to libor plus 2.25% per annum and matures on september 6, 2021, with two, one-year extension options, subject to certain conditions. in connection with the construction financing, we obtained the right to complete the construction of the garage underneath the project being developed by an affiliate of our joint venture partner and obtain funding from the garage construction lender. we agreed to guarantee completion of the garage to the construction lender and an affiliate of our partner agreed to reimburse us for our partner's share of any payments under the guarantee.
environmental matters it is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update phase i environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos surveys in connection with our acquisition of properties. these pre-purchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and we are not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to our properties that we believe would have such a material adverse effect. however, from time to time environmental conditions at our properties have required and may in the future require environmental testing and/or regulatory filings, as well as remedial action.
in february 1999, we (through a joint venture) acquired from exxon corporation a property in massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater contamination. we developed an office park on the property. we engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction. under the property acquisition agreement, exxon agreed to (1) bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to our ownership, (2) continue monitoring and/or remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3) indemnify us for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions. any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses, and there can be no assurance that the amounts paid under the indemnity, if any, would be sufficient to cover the liabilities arising from any such releases and discharges.
environmental investigations at some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off-site source properties. in each case we engaged a licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments, and to prepare any required submittals to the regulatory authorities. in each case the environmental consultant concluded that the properties qualify under the regulatory program or the regulatory practice for a status which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site. we also believe that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory provisions or regulatory practices regarding upgradient releases. although we believe that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties may bear responsibility for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, we will take such further response actions (if any) that we deem necessary or advisable. other than periodic testing at some of these properties, no such additional response actions are anticipated at this time.
some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates are located in urban, industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or current or historical use of the areas have caused site contamination. accordingly, it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and/or groundwater handling procedures and/or include particular building design features in connection with development, construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure and/or ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner. in these situations, it is our practice to investigate the nature and extent of detected contamination, including potential issues associated with contaminant migration, assess potential liability risks and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures. we then use this information as part of our decision-making process with respect to the acquisition, deal structure and/or development of the property. for example, we own a parcel in massachusetts which was formerly used as a quarry/asphalt batching facility. pre-purchase testing indicated that the site contained relatively low levels of certain contaminants. we have developed an office park on this property. prior to and during redevelopment activities, we engaged a specially
108
licensed environmental consultant to monitor environmental conditions at the site and prepare necessary regulatory submittals based on the results of an environmental risk characterization. a submittal has been made to the regulatory authorities in order to achieve regulatory closure at this site. the submittal included an environmental deed restriction that mandates compliance with certain protective measures in a portion of the site where low levels of residual soil contamination have been left in place in accordance with applicable laws.
we expect that resolution of the environmental matters described above will not have a material impact on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. however, we cannot assure you that we have identified all environmental liabilities at our properties, that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties, that we will be indemnified, in full or at all, or that we will have insurance coverage in the event that such environmental liabilities arise.
new accounting pronouncements for a discussion of the new accounting pronouncements that may have an effect on our consolidated financial statements (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).
inflation substantially all of our leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations over a base amount. in addition, many of our leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed increases. we believe that inflationary increases in costs may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and operating expense escalations.

item 1a. risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k, we have identified the following additional risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition or results of operations. investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impact our business operations. if any of these risks occur, our business prospects, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, the market price of our capital stock and the trading price of our debt securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our capital stock or debt securities.
risks related to our real estate investments and our operations developments such as an economic downturn, instability in the banking sector or a negative impact on economic growth resulting from current or future legislation or government initiatives may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
the industry in which we operate may be adversely affected by national and international economic conditions. although the u.s. real estate market has recently improved, certain international markets are experiencing increased levels of volatility due to a combination of factors, including, among others, political instability from ongoing geopolitical conflicts, high unemployment rates, fluctuating oil and gas prices and fiscal deficits, and these factors could contribute to an economic downturn in the u.s. if the u.s. experiences a downturn in the economy, instability in the banking sector or a negative impact on economic growth resulting from changes in legislation, government tax increases, debt policy or spending restrictions, we may experience adverse effects on our occupancy levels, our rental revenues and the value of our properties, any of which could adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.
other economic risks which may adversely affect conditions in the markets in which we operate include the following:
•   local conditions, such as an oversupply of apartments or other housing available for rent, or a reduction in demand for apartments in the area;
•   low mortgage interest rates and home pricing, making alternative housing more affordable;
•   government or builder incentives with respect to home ownership, making alternative housing options more attractive; and
•   regional economic downturns which affect one or more of our geographical markets.
failure to generate sufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions.
our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions depends on our ability to generate cash flow in excess of operating costs and capital expenditure requirements and/or to have access to the markets for debt and equity
8
financing. our funds from operations may be insufficient because of factors that are beyond our control. such events or conditions could include:
•   competition from other apartment communities;
•   overbuilding of new apartments or oversupply of available apartments in our markets, which might adversely affect occupancy or rental rates and/or require rent concessions in order to lease apartments;
•   conversion of condominiums and single family houses to rental use or the increase in the number condominiums and single family homes available for sale;
•   weakness in the overall economy which lowers job growth and the associated demand for apartment housing;
•   increases in operating costs (including real estate taxes, utilities and insurance premiums) due to inflation and other factors, which may not be offset by increased rental rates;
•   inability to initially, or subsequently after lease terminations, rent apartments on favorable economic terms;
•   failure of development communities to be completed within budget and on a timely basis or to lease-up as anticipated, if at all;
•   changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance;
•   changes in laws including, but not limited to, tax laws and housing laws including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing;
•   withdrawal of government support of apartment financing through its financial backing of the federal national mortgage association, or fannie mae, or the federal home loan mortgage corporation, or freddie mac;
•   an uninsured loss, including those resulting from a catastrophic storm, earthquake, or act of terrorism;
•   changes in interest rate levels and the availability of financing, borrower credit standards, and down-payment requirements which could lead renters to purchase homes (if interest rates decrease and home loans are more readily available) or increase our acquisition and operating costs (if interest rates increase and financing is less readily available); and
•   the relative illiquidity of real estate investments.
at times, we have relied on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders and our capital investment program, including our existing property developments. while we have sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings, if necessary, any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to make payments on our debt and to make distributions at the current rate, in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate. any decline in our funds from operations could adversely affect our ability to make distributions or to meet our loan covenants and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price or the trading price of our debt securities.
we are dependent on a concentration of our investments in a single asset class, making our results of operations more vulnerable to a downturn or slowdown in the sector or other economic factors.
as of december 31, 2017, substantially all of our investments are concentrated in the multifamily sector. as a result, we will be subject to risks inherent in investments in a single type of property. a downturn or slowdown in the demand for multifamily housing may have more pronounced effects on our results of operations or on the value of our assets than if we had diversified our investments into more than one asset class.
our operations are concentrated in the southeast and southwest regions of the united states; we are subject to general economic conditions in the regions in which we operate.
as of december 31, 2017, approximately 39.4% of our portfolio is located in our top five markets: atlanta, georgia; dallas, texas; austin, texas; charlotte, north carolina; and orlando, florida. in addition, our overall operations are concentrated in the southeast and southwest regions of the united states. our performance could be adversely affected by economic conditions in, and other factors relating to, these geographic areas, including supply and demand for apartments in these areas, zoning and other regulatory conditions and competition from other communities and alternative forms of housing. in particular our performance is disproportionately influenced by job growth and unemployment. to the extent the economic conditions, job growth and unemployment in any of these markets deteriorate or any of these areas experiences natural disasters, the value of our portfolio, our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions could be adversely affected.
failure to succeed in new markets or sectors may have adverse consequences on our performance.
we may make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise. our historical experience in our existing markets does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets, should we
9
choose to enter them. we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets, including an inability to accurately evaluate local market conditions, to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities, to hire and retain key personnel, and a lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures. in addition, we may abandon opportunities to enter new markets that we have begun to explore for any reason and may, as a result, fail to recover expenses already incurred.
substantial competition among apartment communities and real estate companies may adversely affect our revenues and development and acquisition opportunities.
there are numerous other apartment communities and real estate companies, some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we have, within the market area of each of our communities that compete with us for residents and development and acquisition opportunities. the number of competitive apartment communities and real estate companies in these areas could have a material effect on (1) our ability to rent our apartments and generate revenues, and (2) development and acquisition opportunities. the activities of these competitors could cause us to pay a higher price for a new property than we otherwise would have paid or may prevent us from purchasing a desired property at all, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make payments on our debt and make distributions.
actual or threatened terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and could decrease the value of our assets.
actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. attacks that directly impact one or more of our apartment communities could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results. further, our insurance coverage may not cover all losses caused by a terrorist attack. in addition, the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the u.s. economy could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
we rely on information technology systems in our operations, and any breach or security failure of those systems could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.
we rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store information and to manage or support our business processes. we maintain confidential financial and business information regarding us and persons with which we do business on our information technology systems. we also collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents and prospective residents in connection with our leasing and property management activities, and we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our employees in connection with their employment. in addition, we engage third party service providers that may collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents, prospective residents and employees in connection with providing business services to us, including web hosting, property management, leasing, accounting and payroll services. the protection of the information technology systems on which we rely is critically important to us. we take steps, and generally require third party service providers to take steps, to protect the security of the information maintained in our and our service providers' information technology systems, including the use of systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting and storing of the information. however, we face risks associated with breaches or security failures of the information technology systems on which we rely, which could result from, among other incidents, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the internet, malware, computer viruses or employee error or misconduct. this risk of a breach or security failure, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusion, has generally increased due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of the perpetrators of attempted attacks and intrusions.
the security measures put in place by us and our service providers cannot provide absolute security and there can be no assurance that we or our service providers will not suffer a data security incident in the future, that unauthorized parties will not gain access to sensitive information stored on our or our service providers' systems, that such access will not, whether temporarily or permanently, impact, interfere with or interrupt our operations, or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely manner. even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable as the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed to not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. accordingly, we and our providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures. further, in the future, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance information security measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.
a data security incident could compromise our or our service providers' information technology systems, and the information stored by us or our service providers, including personally identifiable information of residents, prospective
10
residents and employees, could be accessed, misused, publicly disclosed, corrupted, lost or stolen. any failure to prevent a breach or a security failure of our or our service providers' information technology systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation and brand, damage our competitive position, make it difficult for us to attract and retain residents, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future apartment community acquisitions, and the failure to integrate acquired apartment communities and new personnel successfully could create inefficiencies.
we have acquired in the past, and if presented with attractive opportunities we intend to acquire in the future, apartment communities that meet our investment criteria. our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:
•   we may be unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all;
•   even if we are able to finance the acquisition, cash flow from the acquisition may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments on the acquisition;
•   even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for an apartment community, we may be unable to complete the acquisition after incurring certain acquisition-related costs;
•   we may incur significant costs and divert management's attention in connection with the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, including potential acquisitions that we are subsequently unable to complete;
•   when we acquire an apartment community, we may invest additional amounts in it with the intention of increasing profitability, and these additional investments may not produce the anticipated improvements in profitability;
•   we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate acquired apartment communities and new personnel into our existing operations, and the failure to successfully integrate such apartment communities or personnel will result in inefficiencies that could adversely affect our expected return on our investments and our overall profitability; and
•   we may acquire properties that are subject to liabilities or that have problems relating to environmental condition, state of title, physical condition or compliance with zoning laws, building codes or other legal requirements and in each case, our acquisition may be without any, or with only limited, recourse with respect to unknown liabilities or conditions and we may be obligated to pay substantial sums to settle or cure it, which could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results.
we are subject to certain risks associated with selling apartment communities, which could limit our operational and financial flexibility.
we periodically dispose of apartment communities that no longer meet our strategic objectives, but adverse market conditions may make it difficult to sell apartment communities like the ones we own. we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms we set, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. furthermore, we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. these conditions may limit our ability to dispose of properties and to change our portfolio promptly in order to meet our strategic objectives, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market value of our securities. we are also subject to the following risks in connection with sales of our apartment communities:
•   a significant portion of the proceeds from our overall property sales may be held by intermediaries in order for some sales to qualify as like-kind exchanges under section 1031 of the code, so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes. as a result, we may not have immediate access to all of the cash proceeds generated from our property sales. in addition, if a transaction intended to qualify as a section 1031 exchange is later determined to be taxable, we may face adverse consequences, and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed, we may not be able to dispose of properties on a tax deferred basis. intermediary agents of section 1031 exchange transactions typically handle large sums of money in trusts. misappropriation of funds by one of these agents could have a material negative impact on our results of operations. additionally, misappropriation of funds could result in the disposal of the property not qualifying for a tax deferred basis and adversely affect our financial condition. it is also possible the qualification of a transaction as a section 1031 exchange could be successfully challenged and determined to be currently taxable. in such case, our taxable income and earnings and profits would increase, which could increase the dividend income to our shareholders by reducing any return of capital they received. in some circumstances, we may be required to pay additional dividends or, in lieu of additional dividends, corporate income tax, possibly including interest and penalties. as a result, we may be required to borrow funds in order to pay additional dividends or taxes and the payment of such taxes could cause us to have less cash available to distribute to our shareholders. in addition, if a section 1031 exchange were later to be determined to be taxable, we
11
may be required to amend our tax returns for the applicable year in question, including any information reports sent to our shareholders; and
•   federal tax laws applicable to reits limit our ability to profit on the sale of communities, and this limitation may prevent us from selling communities when market conditions are favorable.
property ownership through joint ventures could limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest.
from time to time we may acquire and/or develop properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. in that case, we could become engaged in a dispute with one or more of our partners which might affect our ability to operate a jointly-owned property. moreover, our partners could have business, economic or other objectives that are inconsistent with our objectives, including objectives that relate to the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of a property. in some instances, our partners could have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest. also, our partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due and we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses. in general, we and our partners could each have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partners' interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and may result in the valuation of our interest in the joint venture (if we are the seller) or of our partners' interest in the joint venture (if we are the buyer) at levels which may not be representative of the valuation that would result from an arm's length marketing process. other potential risks of a jointly-owned property include (i) a deadlock if we and our partners are unable to agree upon certain major and other decisions, (ii) a limitation of our ability to liquidate our position in the partnership or joint venture without the consent of the other partners and (iii) a requirement to provide guarantees in favor of lenders with respect to the indebtedness of the joint venture.
environmental problems are possible and can be costly.
under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances in, on, around or under such property. such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. the presence of, or failure to properly remediate, hazardous, toxic substances or petroleum product releases may adversely affect the owner's or operator's ability to sell or rent the affected property or to borrow using the property as collateral. persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at a disposal or treatment facility, whether or not the facility is owned or operated by the person. certain environmental laws impose liability for the release of asbestos-containing materials into the air, and third parties may also seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injury associated with asbestos-containing materials and other hazardous or toxic substances. federal and state laws also regulate the operation and subsequent removal of certain underground storage tanks. in connection with the current or former ownership (direct or indirect), operation, management, development or control of real property, we may be considered an owner or operator of such communities or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and, therefore, may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs, as well as certain other costs, including governmental fines, and claims for injuries to persons and property.
our current policy is to obtain a phase i environmental study on each apartment community that we seek to acquire or develop, which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling, and to proceed accordingly. we cannot assure you, however, that the phase i environmental studies or other environmental studies undertaken with respect to any of our current or future apartment communities will reveal:
•   all or the full extent of potential environmental liabilities;
•   that any prior owner or operator of a property did not create any material environmental condition unknown to us;
•   that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of such apartment communities; or
•   that environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions and pay amounts due on our debt.
certain environmental laws impose liability on a previous owner of property to the extent that hazardous or toxic substances were present during the prior ownership period. a transfer of the property does not relieve an owner of such liability. thus, we may have liability with respect to apartment communities previously sold by our predecessors or by us. there have been a number of lawsuits against owners and operators of multifamily communities alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate. some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements. insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding mold-related claims from
12
standard policies and pricing mold endorsements separately. we have obtained a separate pollution insurance policy that covers mold-related claims and have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our communities as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold. to the extent not covered by our pollution policy, the presence of mold could expose us to liability from residents and others if property damage or health concerns, or allegations thereof, arise.
extreme weather or natural disasters may cause property damage or disrupt business, which could harm our business and operating results.
we have properties located in areas that may be subject to extreme weather and natural disasters, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, winds, floods, hurricanes and fires. such conditions may damage our properties, disrupt our operations and adversely impact our tenants. there can be no assurances that such conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations or business.
losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage, which may negatively impact our results of operations and reduce the value of our properties.
we carry comprehensive liability and property insurance on our communities and intend to obtain similar coverage for apartment communities we acquire in the future. some losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as losses from floods, hurricanes or earthquakes, are subject to limitations, and thus may be uninsured. we exercise our discretion in determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance, with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms. if we suffer a substantial loss, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment. inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed. any losses we experience that are not fully covered by our insurance may negatively impact our results of operations and may reduce the value of our properties.
increasing real estate taxes, utilities and insurance premiums may negatively impact operating results.
as a result of our substantial real estate holdings, the cost of real estate taxes, utilities and insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense. real estate taxes, utilities and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations, which can be widely outside of our control. if the costs associated with real estate taxes, utilities and insurance premiums should rise, without being offset by a corresponding increase in revenues, our results of operations could be negatively impacted, and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions could be adversely affected.
compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost.
the americans with disabilities act of 1990, or the ada, the fair housing act of 1988, or the fha, and other federal, state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons. noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants. these laws may require us to modify our existing apartment communities. these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features that increase our construction costs. legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons. we cannot ascertain the costs of compliance with these laws, which may be substantial.
development and construction risks could impact our profitability.
as of december 31, 2017, we had three development communities under construction totaling 937 units. we may make further investments in these and other development communities as opportunities arise and may do so through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties. our development and construction activities are subject to the following risks:
•   we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased development costs, could delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion of a development community, and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are unable to obtain permits or authorizations;
•   we may be unable to obtain financing for development activities under favorable terms, which could cause a delay in
13
construction resulting in increased costs, decreases in revenue, and potentially cause us to abandon the opportunity;
•   yields may be less than anticipated as a result of delays in completing projects, costs that exceed budget, higher than expected concessions for lease-up and lower rents than initially estimated;
•   bankruptcy of developers in our development projects could impose delays and costs on us with respect to the development of our communities and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations;
•   we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring such opportunities;
•   we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of an apartment community on schedule, or incur development or construction costs that exceed our original estimates, and we may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such costs;
•   occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed apartment community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, preventing us from meeting our profitability goals for that community;
•   when we sell to third parties apartment communities or properties that we developed or renovated, we may be subject to warranty or construction defects that are uninsured or exceed the limit of our insurance; and
•   our failure to successfully enter into a joint venture agreement may prohibit an otherwise advantageous investment if we cannot raise the money through other means.
short-term leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents.
our apartment leases are generally for a term of one year or less. as these leases typically permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty, our revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms.
we may not realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the merger or do so within the anticipated time frame.
because post properties was a public company, we expect to benefit from the elimination of duplicative costs associated with supporting post properties' public company platform and the leveraging of our technology and systems. these savings are expected to be realized upon full integration. integration efforts are ongoing, and we may encounter difficulties and delays in the integration process. if we are unable to manage and complete the integration of post properties' business in an efficient and timely manner, we may not achieve the cost savings anticipated to result from the merger in the expected time frame, or at all. likewise, there can be no assurance that we will realize other anticipated operating efficiencies and synergies from the merger.
risks related to our indebtedness and financing activities our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
as of december 31, 2017, the amount of our total debt was approximately $4.5 billion. we may incur additional indebtedness in the future in connection with, among other things, our acquisition, development and operating activities.
the degree of our leverage creates significant risks, including the following:
•   we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our funds from operations to servicing our debt and our cash flow may be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest;
•   debt service obligations will reduce funds available for distribution and funds available for acquisitions, development and redevelopment;
•   we may be more vulnerable to economic and industry downturns than our competitors that have less debt;
•   we may be limited in our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions;
•   we may default on our indebtedness, which could result in acceleration of those obligations, assignment of rents and leases and loss of properties to foreclosure; and
•   if one of our subsidiaries defaults, it could trigger a cross default or cross acceleration provision under other indebtedness, which could cause an immediate default or could allow the lenders to declare all funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable.
if any one of these events were to occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
14
we may be unable to renew, repay or refinance our outstanding debt, which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.
we are subject to the normal risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, the risk that either secured or unsecured indebtedness, will not be able to be renewed, repaid or refinanced when due or that the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness. if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, if at all, we might be forced to dispose of one or more of our apartment communities on disadvantageous terms, which might result in losses to us. such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions and pay amounts due on our debt. furthermore, if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, the mortgagee could foreclose upon the property, appoint a receiver and receive an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies, all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value. foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds, thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the code.
rising interest rates would increase the cost of our variable rate debt and could adversely impact additional debt we may incur in the future.
we have incurred and expect in the future to incur indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. accordingly, increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions and pay amounts due on our debt or cause us to be in default under certain debt instruments. in addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead holders of shares of our common stock to demand a higher yield on their shares from distributions by us, which could adversely affect the market price for our common stock. in june 2017, the federal reserve reached a decision to raise the federal funds rate by 0.25 points with additional gradual increases anticipated to occur over the next year, subject to ongoing economic uncertainty. in december 2017, the federal reserve increased the federal funds rate by another 0.25 points to a range of 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent. these increases in the federal funds rate and any future increases due to other key economic indicators, such as the unemployment rate or inflation, may cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise, which may negatively impact our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms. any continued adverse economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we may incur additional debt in the future, which may adversely impact our financial condition.
we currently fund the acquisition and development of apartment communities partially through borrowings (including our revolving credit facility) as well as from other sources such as sales of communities which no longer meet our investment criteria. in addition, we may fund other of our capital requirements through debt. our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur, and we may incur more debt in the future. accordingly, subject to limitations on indebtedness set forth in various loan agreements and the indentures governing our senior notes, we could become more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service and an increased risk of default on our obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, our ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions.
the restrictive terms of certain of our indebtedness may cause acceleration of debt payments.
at december 31, 2017, we had outstanding borrowings of approximately $4.5 billion. our indebtedness contains financial covenants as to interest coverage ratios, maximum secured debt, maintenance of unencumbered asset value, and total debt to gross assets, among others, and cross default provisions with other material debt. in the event that an event of default occurs, our lenders may declare borrowings under the respective loan agreements to be due and payable immediately, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions.
failure to hedge effectively against interest rates may adversely affect results of operations.
from time-to-time, we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements, such as interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements. these agreements involve risks, such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such an agreement is not legally enforceable. hedging may reduce overall returns on our investments. failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions.
15
a downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we have a significant amount of debt outstanding. we are currently assigned corporate credit ratings from each of the three ratings agencies based on their evaluation of our creditworthiness. these ratings are based on a number of factors, which include their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flows and earnings. if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, we could be required to pay additional interest and fees on our outstanding borrowings. in addition, a downgrade may adversely impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt and otherwise limit our access to capital, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
financing may not be available and could be dilutive.
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including the occupancy and turnover rates of our apartment communities, development and capital expenditures, costs of operations and potential acquisitions. we cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our capital requirements. if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans, we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated. we and other companies in the real estate industry have experienced limited availability of financing from time to time. restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain debt financing. if we issue additional equity securities to obtain additional financing, the interest of our existing shareholders could be diluted.
risks related to maa's organization and ownership of its stock maa's ownership limit restricts the transferability of its capital stock.
maa's charter limits ownership of its capital stock by any single shareholder to 9.9% of the value of all outstanding shares of its capital stock, both common and preferred, unless approved by its board of directors. the charter also prohibits anyone from buying shares if the purchase would result in it losing reit status. this could happen if a share transaction results in fewer than 100 persons owning all of its shares or in five or fewer persons, applying certain broad attribution rules of the code, owning 50% or more of its shares. if an investor acquires shares in excess of the ownership limit or in violation of the ownership requirements of the code for reits, maa:
•   will consider the transfer to be null and void;
•   will not reflect the transaction on its books;
•   may institute legal action to enjoin the transaction;
•   will not pay dividends or other distributions with respect to those shares;
•   will not recognize any voting rights for those shares;
•   will consider the shares held in trust for its benefit; and
•   will either direct the holder to sell the shares and turn over any profit to maa, or maa will redeem the shares. if maa redeems the shares, the holder will be paid a price equal to the lesser of:
◦   the principal price paid for the shares by the holder,
◦   a price per share equal to the market price (as determined in the manner set forth in its charter) of the applicable capital stock,
◦   the market price (as so determined) on the date such holder would, but for the restrictions on transfers set forth in its charter, be deemed to have acquired ownership of the shares and
◦   the maximum price allowed under the tennessee greenmail act (such price being the average of the highest and lowest closing market price for the shares during the 30 trading days preceding the purchase of such shares or, if the holder of such shares has commenced a tender offer or has announced an intention to seek control of maa, during the 30 trading days preceding the commencement of such tender offer or the making of such announcement).
the redemption price may be paid, at maa's option, by delivering one common unit (subject to adjustment from time to time in the event of, among other things, stock splits, stock dividends, or recapitalizations affecting its common stock or certain mergers, consolidations or asset transfers by maa) issued by the operating partnership for each excess share being redeemed.
if an investor acquires shares in violation of the limits on ownership described above:
•   the holder may lose its power to dispose of the shares;
16
•   the holder may not recognize profit from the sale of such shares if the market price of the shares increases; and
•   the holder may be required to recognize a loss from the sale of such shares if the market price decreases.
future offerings of debt or equity securities, which may rank senior to our common stock, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
if we decide to issue additional debt securities in the future, which would rank senior to our common stock, it is likely that they will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. additionally, any equity securities or convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution to owners of our common stock. we and, indirectly, our shareholders, will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of any future offerings. thus, holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings.
the form, timing and amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations.
though our board of directors has a history of declaring dividends in advance of the quarter they are paid, the form, timing and amount of dividend distributions will be declared, and standing practice changed, at the discretion of the board of directors. the form, timing and amount of dividend distributions will depend on actual cash from operations, our financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as our board of directors may consider relevant. our board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time.
provisions of maa's charter and tennessee law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of maa.
ownership limit the 9.9% ownership limit discussed above may have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of maa by a third party without the consent of our board of directors.
preferred stock maa's charter authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, 867,846 of which have been designated as 8.50% series i cumulative redeemable preferred stock, which we refer to as maa series i preferred stock. in addition to the maa series i preferred stock, the board of directors may establish the preferences and rights of any other series of preferred shares issued. the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of maa, even if a change in control were in maa shareholders' best interests. as of december 31, 2017, 867,846 shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding, all of which shares were maa series i preferred stock.
tennessee anti-takeover statutes as a tennessee corporation, maa is subject to various legislative acts, which impose restrictions on and require compliance with procedures designed to protect shareholders against unfair or coercive mergers and acquisitions. these statutes may delay or prevent offers to acquire maa and increase the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if maa's acquisition would be in maa shareholders' best interests.
market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of maa's common stock.
the market price of shares of common stock of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares, as a percentage of the price of the shares, relative to market interest rates. if market interest rates increase, prospective purchasers of maa's common stock may expect a higher annual distribution rate. higher interest rates would not, however, result in more funds for maa to distribute and, in fact, would likely increase maa's borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution. this could cause the market price of maa's common stock to go down. in addition, although maa's common stock is listed on the nyse, the daily trading volume of maa's common stock may be lower than the trading volume for other industries. as a result, maa's investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of maa's common stock.
17
changes in market conditions or a failure to meet the market's expectations with regard to our results of operations and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of maa's common stock.
we believe that the market value of a reit's equity securities is based primarily upon the market's perception of the reit's growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions, and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets. for that reason, maa's common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share. to the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves or other purposes, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may not correspondingly increase the market price of maa's common stock. in addition, we are subject to the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to pay distributions to maa's shareholders. our failure to meet the market's expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of maa's common stock.
the stock markets, including the nyse, on which maa lists its common stock, have, at times, experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. as a result, the market price of maa's common stock could be similarly volatile, and investors in maa's common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. among the market conditions that may affect the market price of maa's publicly traded securities are the following:
•   our financial condition and operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;
•   actual or anticipated differences in our quarterly and annual operating results;
•   changes in our revenues or earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;
•   publication of research reports about us or our industry by securities analysts;
•   additions and departures of key personnel;
•   inability to access the capital markets;
•   strategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, dispositions, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy;
•   the issuance of additional shares of maa's common stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, including under maa's at-the-market offering programs;
•   the reputation of reits generally and the reputation of reits with portfolios similar to ours;
•   the attractiveness of the securities of reits in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other real estate companies);
•   an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for maa's common stock;
•   the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us or our industry;
•   speculation in the press or investment community;
•   actions by institutional shareholders or hedge funds;
•   changes in accounting principles;
•   terrorist acts; and
•   general market conditions, including factors unrelated to our performance.
in the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention and resources.
risks related to the operating partnership's organization and ownership of op units the operating partnership's existing unitholders have limited approval rights, which may prevent the operating partnership's sole general partner, maa, from completing a change of control transaction that may be in the best interests of all unitholders and of all the shareholders of maa.
maa may not engage in a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the operating partnership, dissolve the operating partnership or, upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, take any action that would result in any unitholder realizing taxable gain, without the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding op units held by holders other than maa or its affiliates, or class a op units. the right of the holders of our class a op units to vote on these transactions could limit maa's ability to complete a change of control transaction that might otherwise be in the best interest of all unitholders of the operating partnership and all shareholders of maa.
18
in certain circumstances, certain of the operating partnership's unitholders must approve the operating partnership's sale of certain properties contributed by the unitholders.
in certain circumstances as detailed in the partnership agreement of the operating partnership, the operating partnership may not sell or otherwise transfer certain properties unless a specified percentage of the limited partners who were partners in the limited partnership holding such properties at the time of its acquisition by us approves such sale or transfer. the exercise of these approval rights by the operating partnership's unitholders could delay or prevent the operating partnership from completing a transaction that may be in the best interest of all of the operating partnership's unitholders and all shareholders of maa.
maa, its officers and directors have substantial influence over the operating partnership's affairs.
maa, as the operating partnership's sole general partner and acting through its officers and directors, has a substantial influence on the operating partnership's affairs. maa, its officers and directors could exercise their influence in a manner that is not in the best interest of the operating partnership's unitholders. also, maa owns approximately 96.4% of the op units and as such, will have substantial influence on the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to the operating partnership's unitholders for approval.
market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of maa's common stock, which would affect the redemption price of the op units.
the market price of shares of common stock of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares, as a percentage of the price of the shares, relative to market interest rates. if market interest rates increase, prospective purchasers of maa's common stock may expect a higher annual distribution rate. higher interest rates would not, however, result in more funds for maa to distribute and, in fact, would likely increase maa's borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution. this could cause the market price of maa's common stock to go down, which would reduce the price received upon redemption of any op units, or if maa so elects, the value of maa's common stock received in lieu of cash upon redemption of such op units. in addition, although maa's common stock is listed on the nyse, the daily trading volume of maa's shares may be lower than the trading volume for companies in other industries. as a result, maa's investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of the shares.
insufficient cash flow from operations or a decline in the market price of maa's common stock may reduce the amount of cash available to the operating partnership to meet its obligations.
the operating partnership is subject to the risk that its cash flow will be insufficient to service its debt and to pay distributions to its unitholders, which may cause maa to not have the funds to pay distributions to its shareholders. maa's failure to meet the market's expectations with regard to future results of operations and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of its shares and thus potentially reduce maa's ability to contribute funds from issuances down to the operating partnership, resulting in a lower level of cash available for investment, to service debt or to make distributions to the operating partnership's unitholders.
risks related to tax laws failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation, which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to shareholders.
if maa fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes, maa will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates (subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax) without the benefit of the dividends paid deduction applicable to reits. in addition, unless maa is entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, maa would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which it loses its qualification. the additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to maa's shareholders. maa's failure to qualify as a reit also could impair its ability to expand its business and raise capital, and would adversely affect the value of maa's stock.
maa believes that it is organized and qualified as a reit, and maa intends to operate in a manner that will allow it to continue to qualify as a reit. maa cannot assure, however, that it is qualified or will remain qualified as a reit. this is because qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which
19
there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within maa's control. in addition, future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of qualification as a reit.
even if maa qualifies as a reit, maa will be subject to various federal, state and local taxes, including property taxes and income taxes on taxable income that maa does not timely distribute to its shareholders. in addition, maa may hold certain assets and engage in certain activities that a reit could not engage in directly through its taxable reit subsidiaries, or trss, and those trss will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on their taxable income without the benefit of the dividends paid deduction applicable to reits.
furthermore, we have a subsidiary that has elected to be treated as a reit, and if our subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit, it is possible that we also would fail to qualify as a reit unless we (or the subsidiary reit) could qualify for certain relief provisions. the qualification of our subsidiary reit as a reit will depend on satisfaction, on an annual or quarterly basis, of numerous requirements set forth in highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. a determination as to whether such requirements are satisfied involves various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. the fact that we hold substantially all of our assets through the operating partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements for us. no assurance can be given that our subsidiary reit will qualify as a reit for any particular year.
if post properties, or any other reit previously acquired by us, failed to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we would incur adverse tax consequences and our financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.
prior to the merger, post properties operated in a manner intended to allow it to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. if post properties, or any other reit previously acquired by maa (each, a "merged reit"), is determined to have lost its reit status at any time prior to its merger with maa, maa would be subject to serious adverse tax consequences, including:
•   maa would be required to pay u.s. federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the taxable income of such merged reit without the benefit of the dividends paid deduction for the taxable years that the merged reit did not qualify as a reit and for which the statute of limitations period remains open; and
•   maa would be required to pay any federal alternative minimum tax liability of the merged reit and any applicable state and local tax liability, in each case, for all taxable years that remain open under the applicable statute of limitations periods.
maa is liable for any tax liability of a merged reit with respect to any periods prior to the merger of such merged reit with maa. if a merged reit failed to qualify as a reit, then in the event of a taxable disposition by maa of an asset previously held by the merged reit during a specified period of up to 5 years following the merger of the merged reit with maa, maa will be subject to corporate income tax with respect to any built-in gain inherent in such asset as of the date of such merger. in addition, unless an applicable statutory relief provision applies, if a merged reit failed to qualify as a reit for a taxable year, then the merged reit would not have been entitled to re-elect to be taxed as a reit until the fifth taxable year following the year during which it was disqualified. furthermore, if both maa and a merged reit were "investment companies" under the "investment company" rules set forth in section 368 of the code at the time of the merger of maa and such merged reit, the failure of maa or such merged reit to have qualified as a reit at the time of their merger could result in such merger being treated as taxable for federal income tax purposes. as a result of all these factors, the failure by a merged reit to have qualified as a reit could jeopardize maa's qualification as a reit and require the operating partnership to provide material amounts of cash to maa to satisfy maa's additional tax liabilities and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on maa's business prospects, financial condition or results of operations and on maa's ability to make payments on our debt and to make distributions.
the operating partnership may fail to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
we believe that the operating partnership qualifies, and has so qualified since its formation, as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and not as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation. no assurance can be provided, however, that the internal revenue service, or irs, will not challenge the treatment of the operating partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. if the irs were successful in treating the operating partnership as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, then the taxable income of the operating partnership would be taxable at regular corporate income tax rates. in addition, the treatment of the operating partnership as a
20
corporation would cause maa to fail to qualify as a reit. see "failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation, which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to shareholders" above.
certain dispositions of property by us may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a 100% penalty tax on any gain attributable to the disposition.
any gain resulting from a transfer of property that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated for federal income tax purposes as income from a prohibited transaction that is subject to a 100% penalty tax. since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property would be considered prohibited transactions. whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. as such, the irs may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. if the irs were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. in addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes. a safe harbor to the characterization of the disposition of property as a prohibited transaction and the resulting imposition of the 100% tax is available; however, we cannot assure that we will be able to comply with such safe harbor in connection with any property dispositions.
the recently enacted legislation informally titled the tax cuts and jobs act and other legislative, regulatory and administrative developments may adversely affect maa or its shareholders.
on december 22, 2017, president trump signed into law p.l. 115-97, informally titled the tax cuts and jobs act, or the tax act. the tax act makes major changes to the code, including a number of provisions of the code that affect the taxation of reits and their shareholders. certain provisions of the tax act that may impact us and our shareholders include:
•   temporarily reducing individual u.s. federal income tax rates on ordinary income; the highest individual u.s. federal income tax rate will be reduced from 39.6% to 37% (through taxable years ending in 2025);
•   reducing the maximum corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%;
•   permitting a deduction for certain pass-through business income, including dividends received from reits that are not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income, which generally will allow individuals, trusts and estates to deduct up to 20% of such amounts, resulting in an effective maximum u.s. federal income tax rate of 29.6% on such dividends (through taxable years ending in 2025);
•   reducing the highest rate of withholding with respect to distributions to non-u.s. shareholders attributable to gains from the sale or exchange of u.s. real property interests from 35% to 21%;
•   limiting the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of taxable income (prior to the application of dividends paid deduction);
•   amending the limitation on the deduction of net interest expense for all businesses, other than certain electing businesses, including real estate businesses (which could adversely affect the taxation of any taxable reit subsidiaries); and
•   eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax.
the individual and collective impact of these provisions and other provisions of the tax act on maa and its shareholders is uncertain, and may not become evident for some period of time. in addition, other legislative, regulatory or administrative changes may be enacted or promulgated, either prospectively or with retroactive effect, and may adversely affect maa or its shareholders. maa's shareholders and prospective shareholders should consult their individual tax advisors regarding the implications of the tax act and other potential legislative, regulatory or administrative changes on their investment in maa's capital stock.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of both maa and the operating partnership, of which maa is the sole general partner and in which maa owned a 96.4% limited partner interest as of december 31, 2017. maa conducts all of its business through the operating partnership and its various subsidiaries. this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
maa is a multifamily focused, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or reit. we own, operate, acquire and selectively develop apartment communities primarily located in the southeast and southwest regions of the united states. as of december 31, 2017, activities include full ownership and operation of 301 multifamily properties, which includes commercial space at certain properties, four additional commercial properties, and a partial ownership in one multifamily property. these properties are located in alabama, arizona, arkansas, colorado, florida, georgia, kansas, kentucky, maryland, mississippi, missouri, nevada, north carolina, south carolina, tennessee, texas, virginia and washington, d.c.
our primary business objectives are to protect and grow existing property values, to maintain a stable and increasing cash flow that will fund our dividends and distributions through all parts of the real estate investment cycle, and to create shareholder value by growing in a disciplined manner. to achieve these objectives, we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies:
•   effectively and efficiently operate our existing properties with an intense property and asset management focus and a decentralized structure;
•   manage real estate cycles by taking an opportunistic approach to buying, selling, renovating and developing apartment communities;
28
•   diversify investment capital across markets in which we operate to achieve a balanced portfolio with less volatile operating performance; and
•   actively manage our capital structure to enhance predictability of earnings to fund our dividends and distributions.
overview we experienced an increase in net income available for maa common shareholders for the year ended december 31, 2017 as the growth in revenues outpaced increases in our property operating expenses. the increase in revenues was primarily driven by a 3.0% increase in our large market same store segment, a 2.6% increase in our secondary market same store segment and a $375.2 million increase in our non-same store and other segment, which was primarily a result of the merger. the increase in property operating expenses was primarily due to a 2.0% increase in our large market same store segment, a 2.7% increase in our secondary market same store segment and a $145.1 million increase in our non-same store and other segment, which was primarily the result of the merger. the drivers of these increases are discussed below in the "results of operations" section.
on december 1, 2016, we consummated the merger and acquired all of post properties' consolidated net assets. the consolidated net assets and results of operations of post properties are included in our consolidated financial statements from the closing date of the merger going forward. all properties acquired from post properties are included in our non-same store and other operating segment, as the properties are recent acquisitions and had not been owned and stabilized for at least twelve months as of january 1, 2017.
over the past three years, our growth has been driven by our acquisition strategy to invest in large and mid-sized growing markets in the southeast and southwest region of the united states. as a result of the merger, we acquired 61 apartment communities in 2016. we acquired two apartment communities in 2017, five in 2016 apart from the merger, and seven in 2015. we disposed of five apartment communities in 2017, 12 in 2016, and 21 in 2015.
trends during the year ended december 31, 2017, demand for apartments continued to be relatively strong, as it was during the year ended december 31, 2016. this strength was evident on two fronts: occupancy and effective rent per unit. same store physical occupancy at december 31, 2017 was 97%. average physical occupancy for the same store portfolio was 96.2% for the year ended december 31, 2017, consistent with the year ended december 31, 2016. same store average effective rent per unit continued to increase, and was up 3.0% for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. as we move through the remainder of the typically slower winter leasing season and into the typically stronger spring leasing season, we believe the current level of physical occupancy puts us in a good position to capture solid pricing in the first half of 2018.
an important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain a diversity of markets, submarkets, product types and price points across the southeast and southwest regions of the united states. this diversity tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area. we believe that a well-balanced portfolio, including inner loop, suburban, and downtown/central business district locations and various monthly rent price points, will perform well in "up" cycles as well as weather "down" cycles better. through our investment in 37 defined metropolitan statistical areas, or msas, we are diversified across markets, urban and suburban submarkets, and a variety of monthly rent pricing points.
current supply levels are impacting our total portfolio from a demand standpoint, particularly properties located in urban submarkets, the majority of which were acquired in the merger. properties in our same store portfolio have been impacted somewhat less by supply, primarily because less new development has occurred in those submarkets. encouragingly, according to u.s. census bureau data, full year 2017 multifamily permitting across our markets was down 5% as compared to the prior year. this activity should result in relatively lower supply in our markets in the future as compared to the current environment.
demand for our apartments is primarily driven by general economic conditions in our markets. in particular, job growth relative to new supply is a critical factor in our ability to maintain occupancy and increase rents. to the extent that the tax cuts and jobs act results in improving economic conditions such as increased job growth or more disposable income, we believe that we may be able to maintain occupancy more effectively and increase rents.
also, we believe that more disciplined credit terms for residential mortgages should continue to favor rental demand at existing multifamily properties. furthermore, rental competition from single family homes has not been a major competitive factor impacting our portfolio. for the year ended december 31, 2017, total move outs attributable to single family home
29
rentals for our combined portfolio represented about 6% of total move outs, in line with the year ended december 31, 2016. we have seen significant rental competition from single family homes in only a few of our submarkets. long term, we expect demographic trends (including the growth of prime age groups for rentals and immigration and population movement to the southeast and southwest regions) will continue to support apartment rental demand in our markets.
rising interest rates may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations. as of december 31, 2017, we had approximately $4.5 billion of debt, of which 17% had variable rate interest and 83% had fixed or hedged interest rates. to the extent interest rates rise, our net interest expense on variable rate debt will increase as will potentially our net interest expense on any debt refinancing. given the short-term nature of our leases, to the extent interest rates rise due to general economic growth, we would expect increases in interest expense to be somewhat offset by positive leasing trends.
results of operations comparison of the year ended december 31, 2017 to the year ended december 31, 2016
for the year ended december 31, 2017, we achieved net income available for maa common shareholders of $324.7 million, a 53.2% increase over the prior year, and total revenue growth of $403.6 million, a 35.9% increase over the prior year. the following discussion describes the primary drivers of the increase in net income for maa common shareholders for the year ended december 31, 2017.
property revenues the following table presents our property revenues by segment for the years ended december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):
december 31, 2017       december 31, 2016           increase           % increase large market same store            $672,131                $652,560               $19,571               3.0       %
secondary market same store         349,007                 340,161                 8,846               2.6       %

non-same store and other            507,849                 132,627               375,222             282.9       %
total                            $1,528,987              $1,125,348              $403,639              35.9       %
the increases in property revenues from our large market same store and secondary market same store portfolio were primarily a result of increased effective rent per unit of 3.1% and 2.7%, respectively, as compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase in property revenues from our non-same store and other portfolio was primarily the result of the merger, as we classified the properties we acquired as non-same store.
property operating expenses property operating expenses include costs for property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping, other operating expenses and depreciation and amortization. the following table reflects our property operating expenses by segment excluding depreciation and amortization for the years ended december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):

the increase in property operating expenses for our large market same store segment was primarily the result of increases in real estate taxes of $4.7 million, personnel expenses of $1.0 million, and utilities expense of $0.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in insurance expense of $1.5 million. the increase in property operating expenses for our secondary market same store segment was primarily driven by increases in real estate taxes of $1.5 million, personnel expenses of $1.3 million, and utilities expense of $0.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in insurance expense of $0.3 million. the increase in property operating expenses for our non-same store and other portfolio was primarily due to the merger.

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december 31, 2017 was approximately $493.7 million, an increase of $170.8 million from the year ended december 31, 2016. in addition to asset acquisitions made in the normal course of business, the increase was primarily driven by the full year of depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the merger compared to only one month of comparable depreciation and amortization in 2016. as a result of the merger, depreciation expense and amortization expense increased $138.2 million and $23.2 million, respectively, for year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016.
other operating expenses property management expenses for the year ended december 31, 2017 were approximately $43.6 million, an increase of $9.5 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily due to the growth in our portfolio as a result of the merger.
merger and integration expenses for the year ended december 31, 2017 were primarily comprised of $16.0 million of systems and professional costs and $4.0 million of legal costs, as we integrated post properties into our consolidated operations. merger and integration expenses for the year ended december 31, 2017 were approximately $20.8 million less than merger and integration expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016, as we incurred significant merger related expenses in 2016 to complete the merger on december 1, 2016.
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2017 were approximately $40.2 million, an increase of $11.2 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily driven by legal expenses.
non-operating expenses and other interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2017 was approximately $154.8 million, an increase of $24.8 million from the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily due to increased borrowing as we assumed several loans as a result of the merger, including a secured loan with a face value of $186.0 million and two unsecured loans with face values of $150.0 million and $250.0 million, respectively. we entered into a new $300.0 million term loan on the closing date of the merger. interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2017 increased $16.0 million due to these borrowings resulting from the merger. in addition, in may 2017, we publicly issued senior unsecured notes with a face value of $600.0 million, bearing interest at 3.60% per annum, which resulted in additional interest expense of approximately $14.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. such increases were offset by a slight decreases in interest expense as a result of retirements of secured property mortgages and unsecured notes during the year ended december 31, 2017; the notes were scheduled to mature in october 2017.
gains on sale of depreciable assets totaled $127.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $47.0 million from the year ended december 31, 2016. although disposition activity decreased year-over-year, the gain on sale of depreciable assets increased primarily due to the nature of the real estate assets sold.
other non-operating income for the year ended december 31, 2017 was $14.4 million, an increase of approximately $16.2 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. the year-over-year increase was primarily due to an $8.8 million increase in the net mark-to-market adjustments of the bifurcated embedded derivative related to the maa series i preferred stock issued in the merger. the year-over-year increase was also driven by the $3.3 million increase in the net gain on debt extinguishment, primarily due to gains of $4.8 million from the write-offs of mark-to-market debt adjustments related to the retirement of secured mortgages and a term loan, partially offset by a cash prepayment penalty of $1.6 million.
during the year ended december 31, 2017 we recorded quarterly dividend distributions to holders of maa's series i preferred stock totaling $3.7 million. as there were no shares of maa series i preferred stock issued and outstanding until completion of the merger on december 1, 2016, preferred dividends only impacted our results of operations for one month totaling $0.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2016.
comparison of the year ended december 31, 2016 to the year ended december 31, 2015
for the year ended december 31, 2016, we achieved net income available for maa common shareholders of $211.9 million, a 36.2% decrease over the prior year, and total revenue growth of $82.6 million, a 7.9% increase over the prior year.

the following discussion describes the primary drivers of the decrease in net income for maa common shareholders for the year ended december 31, 2016.
the comparison of the year ended december 31, 2016 to the year ended december 31, 2015 shows the segment break down based on the 2016 same store portfolios. a comparison using the 2017 same store portfolio would not be comparative due to the nature of the classifications.
property revenues the following table presents our property revenues by segment for the years ended december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):

the increase in property revenues from our same store portfolio was primarily a result of increased effective rent per unit of 4.9% and 2.9% for our large and secondary markets, respectively. the increase in property revenues from our non-same store and other segment was due to the merger.
property operating expenses property operating expenses include costs for property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping, other operating expenses and depreciation and amortization. the following table reflects our property operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization by segment for the years ended december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):

the increase in property operating expenses from our large market same store segment was primarily the result of increases in real estate taxes of $5.3 million, personnel expenses of $1.5 million and utilities expenses of $1.2 million. the increase in property operating expenses from our secondary market same store segment was primarily driven by increases in real estate taxes of $1.3 million. the increase in property operating expenses from our non-same store and other segment was due to the merger.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $323.0 million, an increase of $28.4 million, from the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was primarily driven by depreciation expense of $17.4 million related to the merger. additionally, the amortization of the fair market value of in-place leases related to the merger began in december 2016, and totaled $4.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016.
other operating expenses merger and integration expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016 were $40.8 million as a result of the expenses associated with the merger, which closed on december 1, 2016. there were no merger and integration expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015 as no merger occurred in that year.
interest expense for the year ended december 31, 2016 was approximately $129.9 million, an increase of $7.6 million from the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was due in part to decreased amortization of the fair market value of
32
debt adjustments related to debt acquired and increased interest rates towards the end of 2016. additionally, we assumed additional debt as a result of the merger, including a secured loan in the principal amount of $186.0 million and two series of unsecured senior notes with face values of $150.0 million and $250.0 million, respectively. additionally, we entered into a new $300.0 million term loan on the closing date of the merger.
we recorded a gain on sale of depreciable assets of $80.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, a decrease of approximately $109.6 million from the year ended december 31, 2015. the decrease was primarily the result of a decline in disposition activity year-over-year. dispositions decreased from 21 multifamily properties for the year ended december 31, 2015, to 12 multifamily properties for the year ended december 31, 2016.
non-operating expenses and other other non-operating expense for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $1.8 million, a decrease of approximately $4.4 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the $3.5 million decrease in loss on debt extinguishment due to the 2015 removal of properties from a secured tax-free debt facility; there was an immaterial loss on debt extinguishment activity for the year ended december 31, 2016.
funds from operations funds from operations, or ffo, a non-gaap financial measure, represents net income available for maa common shareholders (computed in accordance with the united states generally accepted accounting principles, or gaap) excluding extraordinary items, asset impairment and gains or losses on disposition of real estate assets, plus net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, depreciation and amortization of real estate, and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis. because noncontrolling interest is added back, ffo, when used in this annual report on form 10-k, represents ffo attributable to the company.
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. management believes that ffo is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance primarily because its calculation excludes depreciation and amortization expense on real estate assets. we believe that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. while our calculation of ffo is in accordance with nareit's definition, it may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other reits.
the following table presents a reconciliation of net income available for maa common shareholders to ffo for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, as we believe net income available for maa common shareholders is the closest corresponding gaap measure (dollars in thousands):

ffo for the year ended december 31, 2017 increased by approximately $236.2 million from the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily as a result of the increases in property revenues of $403.6 million and other non-operating income of $16.2 million, in addition to decreased merger and integration expenses of $20.8 million. the increases to ffo were offset by the impact of increases in property operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, of $153.4 million, interest expense of $24.8 million, general and administrative expenses of $11.2 million, property management expenses of $9.5 million and preferred dividends of $3.4 million.
33
ffo for the year ended december 31, 2016 increased by approximately $11.0 million from the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily as a result of the increase in property revenues of $82.6 million, which was offset by increases in merger and integration expenses of $40.8 million, property operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, of $22.7 million, general and administrative expenses of $3.3 million and property management expenses of $3.1 million.
liquidity and capital resources our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as well as general economic and market conditions, are the principal factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources.
operating activities net cash flow provided by operating activities increased to $658.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 from $484.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily driven by the inclusion of twelve months of operating results of post properties for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to one month of operating results for the year ended december 31, 2016.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2017 was $283.4 million compared to net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2016 of $710.5 million. the primary drivers of the change were as follows:

the decrease in cash outflows for purchases of real estate and other assets resulted from the acquisition of two apartment communities during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the acquisition of five apartment communities during the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase in cash outflows for capital improvements, development and other during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the prior year resulted from the property portfolio increase and development pipeline increase as a result of the merger. the decrease in proceeds from the disposition of real estate assets primarily resulted from the sale of five apartment communities and four land parcels during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the sale of 12 apartment communities, one commercial property, and three land parcels during the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase in cash inflows from the funding of escrow for future acquisitions resulted from the funding of three anticipated future 1031(b) transactions offset by the release of three 1031(b) transactions that never occurred during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the funding of one anticipated future 1031(b) transaction during the year ended december 31, 2016. the decrease in cash outflows for the acquisition of post properties, net of cash acquired, compared to prior year resulted from the completion of the merger; there were no mergers during the year ended december 31, 2017.

the decrease in cash outflows related to the net change in credit lines resulted from the decrease in net borrowings of $80.0 million on our unsecured revolving credit facility and $80.0 million on our secured credit facility during the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to an increase in net borrowings of $415.0 million on the unsecured revolving credit facility and a decrease of $80.0 million on the secured credit facility during the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase in proceeds from notes payable during the year ended december 31, 2017 related to the may 2017 issuance of $600.0 million senior unsecured notes, as discussed in note 6, compared to the 2016 issuance of the unsecured term loan in the amount of $300.0 million. the increase in cash outflows from principal payments on notes payable primarily resulted from paying off approximately $233.6 million of secured property mortgages and $168.0 million of senior unsecured notes during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to paying off the $140.0 million legacy post properties' line of credit facility during the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase in cash outflows from dividends paid on common shares primarily resulted from the increased number of common shares outstanding as a result of the merger and the increase in the annual dividend rate to $3.48 per share during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the dividend rate of $3.28 per share during the year ended december 31, 2016.
equity as of december 31, 2017, maa owned 113,643,166 op units, comprising a 96.4% limited partnership interest in the operating partnership, while the remaining 4,191,586 outstanding op units were held by third party limited partners of the operating partnership. holders of op units (other than maa and its corporate affiliates) may require us to redeem their op units from time to time, in which case maa may, at its option, pay the redemption price either in cash (in an amount per op unit equal, in general, to the average closing price of maa's common stock on the nyse over a specified period prior to the redemption date) or by delivering one share of maa's common stock (subject to adjustment under specified circumstances) for each op unit so redeemed. in addition, maa has registered under the securities act the 4,191,586 shares of its common stock, that as of december 31, 2017, were issuable upon redemption of op units, so that those shares can be sold freely in the public markets.

unsecured revolving credit facility on october 15, 2015, the operating partnership entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks led by keybank national association, or keybank, and fourteen other banks, the keybank facility. the keybank facility replaced our operating partnership's previous unsecured credit facility with keybank. the interest rate is determined using an investment grade pricing grid using libor plus a spread of 0.85% to 1.55%. on december 1, 2016, the operating partnership amended the keybank facility by increasing the borrowing capacity from $750.0 million to $1.0 billion. as of december 31, 2017, we had $410.0 million borrowed under the keybank facility, bearing interest at a rate of libor plus 0.90%. the keybank facility serves as our primary source of short-term liquidity and has an accordion feature that we may use to expand its capacity to $1.5 billion. this facility matures on april 15, 2020, with an option to extend for an additional six months.
senior unsecured notes we have also issued both public and private unsecured notes. as of december 31, 2017, we had approximately $2.0 billion (face value) of publicly issued notes and $292.0 million of unsecured notes issued in two private placements.  in october 2013, we publicly issued $350.0 million of senior unsecured notes due 2023 with a coupon of 4.30%, paid semi-annually on april 15 and october 15. in june 2014, we publicly issued $400.0 million of senior unsecured notes due 2024 with a coupon of 3.75%, paid semi-annually on june 15 and december 15.  in november 2015, we publicly issued $400.0 million senior unsecured notes due 2025 with a coupon of 4.00%, paid semi-annually on may 15 and november 15. as a result of the merger in december 2016, we assumed two series of publicly issued senior notes totaling $400.0 million. one series of senior notes assumed as a result of the merger has a face value of $250.0 million, is due 2022, and has a coupon of 3.38% paid semi-annually on june 1 and december 1. the other series of senior notes assumed as a result of the merger had a face value of $150.0 million and was due in october 2017, but was paid off in july 2017. in may 2017, we publicly issued $600.0 million of senior unsecured notes due june 1, 2027 with a coupon of 3.60%, paid semi-annually on june 1 and december 1. the proceeds from the senior unsecured notes issued in may 2017 were used to pay down outstanding amounts of the key bank facility. as of december 31, 2017, all of these amounts, with the exception of the series of senior unsecured notes assumed in the merger with a face value of $150.0 million that was paid off in july 2017, remained outstanding.
in july 2011, we issued $135.0 million of senior unsecured notes. the notes were offered and sold in a private placement with three maturity tranches: $50.0 million at 4.7% maturing on july 29, 2018, $72.8 million at 5.4% maturing on july 29, 2021; and $12.3 million at 5.6% maturing on july 29, 2023; all of which were outstanding at december 31, 2017. on august 31, 2012, we issued $175.0 million of senior unsecured notes. the notes were offered and sold in a private placement with four tranches: $18.0 million at 3.15% maturing on november 30, 2017; $20.0 million at 3.61% maturing on november 30, 2019; $117.0 million at 4.17% maturing on november 30, 2022; and $20.0 million at 4.33% maturing on november 30, 2024. the $18 million tranche was paid off on its maturity date. the remaining tranches were outstanding as of december 31, 2017.
unsecured term loans in addition to the keybank facility, we maintain four unsecured term loans. we had total borrowings of $850.0 million outstanding under these term loan agreements at december 31, 2017, comprised of:
a $250.0 million term loan with wells fargo, n.a., or wells fargo, that bears interest at a rate of libor plus a spread of 0.90% to 1.90% based on the credit ratings of our unsecured debt. the loan matures on august 1, 2018. as of december 31, 2017, this loan was bearing interest at a rate of libor plus 0.98%.
a $150.0 million term loan with u.s. bank national association, or u.s. bank, that bears interest at a rate of libor plus a spread of 0.90% to 1.90% based on the credit ratings of our unsecured debt. the loan matures on march 1, 2020. as of december 31, 2017, this loan was bearing interest at a rate of libor plus 0.98%.
a $150.0 million term loan with key bank that bears interest at a rate of libor plus a spread of 0.90% to 1.75% based on the credit ratings of our unsecured debt. the loan matures on march 1, 2021. as of december 31, 2017, this loan was bearing interest at a rate of libor plus 0.95%.
a $300.0 million term loan with wells fargo that bears interest at a rate of libor plus a spread of 0.90% to 1.75% based on the credit ratings of our unsecured debt. the loan matures on march 1, 2022. as of december 31, 2017, this loan was bearing interest at a rate of libor plus 0.95%.

secured property mortgages we also maintain secured property mortgages with fannie mae, freddie mac and various life insurance companies. these mortgages are usually fixed rate and can range from five to ten years in maturity. as of december 31, 2017, we had $882.8 million of secured property mortgages.
secured credit facility approximately 1.8% of our outstanding obligations at december 31, 2017 were borrowed through a credit facility with prudential mortgage capital, which is credit enhanced by fannie mae, or the fannie mae facility. the fannie mae facility has a combined line limit of $80.0 million, of which $80.0 million was collateralized, available to borrow, and borrowed, at december 31, 2017. the fannie mae facility matures in 2018.

(1) fixed rate and swapped interest are reflected in this table. the average interest rates of variable rate debt are presented in preceding tables.
(2) represents principal payments gross of discounts, debt issuance costs and fair market value adjustments of debt assumed.
(3) swapped interest is subject to the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges as described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
(4) represents development fees.
(5) primarily comprised of a ground lease underlying one apartment community we own.
we have a commitment, which is not reflected in the table above, to make additional capital contributions to a limited partnership in which we hold an equity interest. the capital contributions may be called by the general partner at any time until september 2022 after giving appropriate notice. at december 31, 2017, we had committed to make additional capital contributions totaling up to $13.5 million if and when called by the general partner of the limited partnership and prior to september 2022.
off-balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2017, and 2016, we did not have any relationships, including those with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
as of december 31, 2017, we had a 35.0% ownership interest in a limited liability company, which owns one apartment community comprised of 269 units, located in washington, d.c. we also had a 31.0% ownership interest in a limited partnership. our interests in these investments are unconsolidated and are recorded using the equity method for the investments as we do not have a controlling interest.
in addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. as such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. we do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with us or our related parties other than those disclosed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
38
insurance we carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities, with limits of liability we believe are customary within the multifamily apartment industry, to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. we also maintain insurance against the risk of direct physical damage to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period.
we renegotiated our primary insurance programs effective july 1, 2017. we believe that the current property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that any insurable loss experienced that can be reasonably anticipated would not have a significant impact on our liquidity, financial position or results of operation.
inflation our resident leases at our apartment communities allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder, and thus may enable us to seek rent increases. almost all leases are for one year or less. the short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation.
critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and that involves some degree of uncertainty. the preceding discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
we believe that the estimates and assumptions listed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require the greatest subjective determinations and form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical.
acquisition of real estate assets we account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate as asset acquisitions in accordance with asu 2017-01, business combinations (topic 805): clarifying the definition of a business, which requires the cost of the of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the individual acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, buildings and improvements and other, and identified intangible assets, consisting of the value of in-place leases and other contracts, on a relative fair value basis. in calculating the total asset value of acquired tangible assets, management uses stabilized net operating income, or noi, and market specific capitalization and discount rates. management analyzed historical stabilized noi to determine its estimate for forecasted noi. management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similarly sized markets. management then allocates the purchase price of the asset acquisition based on the relative fair value of the individual components as a proportion of the total assets acquired.
impairment of long-lived assets we account for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. we periodically evaluate long-lived assets, including investments in real estate, for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance, market conditions and legal factors. long-lived assets, such as real estate assets, equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, which is estimated by analyzing historical cash flows of the asset. if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. we calculate the fair value of an asset by dividing historical operating cash flows by a market capitalization rate. we estimate the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similarly sized markets. no material impairment losses have been recognized
39
during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.
cost capitalization in conformity with gaap, we capitalize those expenditures that materially enhance the value of an existing asset or substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset. expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred. therefore, repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements, renovations, and replacements are capitalized. the cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by us in order to elevate the condition of the property to our standards are capitalized as incurred. the carrying costs related to development projects, including interest, property taxes, insurance and allocated direct development salary cost during the construction period, are capitalized. management uses judgment in determining whether costs should be expensed or capitalized. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for additional detail.
loss contingencies the outcomes of claims, disputes and legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainty. we record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. we review these accruals quarterly and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances. when a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable, then we do not accrue the loss. however, for material loss contingencies, if the unrecorded loss (or an additional loss in excess of the accrual) is at least a reasonable possibility and material, then we disclose a reasonable estimate of the possible loss, or range of loss, if such reasonable estimate can be made. if we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss, or range of loss, then that is disclosed.
the assessment of whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or range of loss is reasonably estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. among the factors that we consider in this assessment, including with respect to the matters disclosed in this annual report on form 10-k, are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims, the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency (if reasonably estimable), the progress of the matter, existing law and precedent, the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, our experience in similar matters, the facts available to us at the time of assessment, and how we intend to respond, or have responded, to the proceeding or claim. our assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress. for matters where we are not currently able to reasonably estimate a range of reasonably possible loss, the factors that have contributed to this determination include the following: (i) the damages sought are indeterminate; (ii) the proceedings are in the early stages; (iii) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories or a large or uncertain number of actual or potential cases or parties; and/or (iv) discussions with the parties in matters that are expected ultimately to be resolved through negotiation and settlement have not reached the point where we believe a reasonable estimate of loss, or range of loss, can be made. in such instances, we believe that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss or business impact, if any.

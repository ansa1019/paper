item 1a.       risk factors in addition to the other information in this report, you should carefully consider the following risks. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and/or operating results could be materially adversely affected. the risk factors summarized below are not the only risks we face. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
the company and tccc have extensive commercial arrangements and, as a result, the companys future performance is substantially dependent on the success of its relationship with tccc.
in connection with the tccc transaction and the accompanying amended distribution coordination agreements entered into with tccc, we have transitioned third parties rights to distribute the companys products in most territories in the u.s. to members of tcccs distribution network, which largely consists of independent bottlers/distributors. in addition, tccc has become our preferred distribution partner globally with members of tcccs network distributing our products internationally in countries throughout, but not limited to, africa, asia, canada, central and south america, europe, mexico and the middle east. as we continue our international expansion, tcccs distribution network will continue its role as our preferred distribution partner globally. as a result, we have reduced our distributor diversification and are now substantially dependent on tcccs domestic and international distribution platforms.
also in connection with the tccc transaction, tccc made a substantial equity investment in the company and has agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to compete in the energy drink category in europe through june 2018 and in certain other territories through june 2020. while we believe that this will incentivize tccc to take steps to assure that our products receive the appropriate attention in the tccc distribution system, there can be no assurance of this as tccc is a much larger company with many strategic priorities. in addition, tccc does not control all members of its distribution system, many of which are independent companies that make their own business decisions that may not always align with tcccs interests. moreover, it is also possible that we may fail to recognize the expected benefits of the new distribution arrangements regardless of tcccs priorities or the priorities of the members of tcccs distribution system. in any such case, our operating results could suffer and the value of the companys common shares could be adversely affected.
we derive virtually all of our revenues from energy drinks, and competitive pressure in the energy drink category could adversely affect our business and operating results.
our focus is in the energy drink category, and our business is vulnerable to adverse changes impacting the energy drink category and business, which could adversely impact our business and the trading price of our common stock.
virtually all of our sales are derived from our energy drinks, including our monster energy® brand energy drinks and our strategic brands acquired from tccc in 2015. our monster energy® brand energy drinks and strategic brands represented 90.1% and 8.9% of net sales, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2017. any decrease in the sales of our monster energy® brand and other energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. historically, we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the energy drink category as well as from the energy shot category. domestically, our energy drinks compete directly with red bull, rockstar, amp, venom, vpx redline, xenergy, mio energy, rip it, starbucks double shot, starbucks double shot energy plus coffee, rockstar roasted, 5-hour energy shots, stacker 2, vpx bang, v8+ energy, uptime, hi*ball and many other brands.  in addition, certain large companies, such as pepsico, market and/or distribute products in that market segment, such as pepsi max, mountain dew and mountain dew kickstart. internationally, our energy drinks compete with red bull, rockstar, v-energy, lucozade and
19
numerous local and private-label brands that usually differ from country to country, such as hell, shock, tiger, boost, speed, tnt, shark, hot 6, shark energy, dragon, score, sting, battery, bullit, flash up, black, non-stop, bomba, semtex, vive 100, dark dog, speed, guaraná, m-150, lipovitan, bacchus, bolt, mr. big, boom, raptor, amp, fusion, hi-tiger, eastroc super drink, carabao, powerhouse, xl, crazy tiger, effect, missile and a host of other international brands. our java monster® and espresso monstertm product lines compete directly with starbucks frappuccino, starbucks double shot, starbucks double shot energy plus coffee and other starbucks coffee drinks, rockstar roasted, dunkin donuts, gold peak tea, stok, high brew, hi*ball and international delight. our muscle monster® product line competes directly with muscle milk, core power, premier protein, kelloggs special k protein, bolthouse farms protein, eas advantedge, gatorade g series 03 recover, 5-hour, power bar and eas myoplex. in addition, our mutant® super soda product line competes directly with mountain dew and mountain dew kickstart. competitive pressures in the energy drink category could impact our revenues, cause price erosion and/or lower market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
the company, in several markets, owns multiple potentially competing brands in the energy drink category.
the strategic brands acquired from tccc in 2015 represented 8.9% of consolidated net sales for the year ended december 31, 2017. in several markets our monster energy® brand energy drinks and strategic brands compete with each other. although we continue to integrate the strategic brands with our broader energy drink portfolio, we may encounter difficulties managing different and potentially competing brands in such shared markets, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.
tccc is a significant shareholder of the company and may have interests that are different from the companys other shareholders (including current shareholders of the company).
as of february 12, 2018, tccc owned common shares of the company representing approximately 18% of the total number of the companys outstanding common shares. tccc has also nominated two directors to the companys board of directors. the number of directors that tccc is entitled to nominate is subject to reduction in certain circumstances.
tcccs ownership could also have an effect on the companys ability to engage in a change in control transaction. tccc is obligated for a period of time to vote all of its common shares of the company in excess of 20% of the outstanding common shares in the same proportion as all common shares not owned by tccc with respect to a proposal for a change of control. however, if tccc were to oppose such a change-in-control transaction, a bidder would be required to secure the support of holders of 62.5% of the companys common shares not owned by tccc (assuming that tccc increased its ownership to 20% of the companys common shares) to achieve a vote of a majority of the companys outstanding shares for a change-in-control transaction. in addition, tccc would have a bidding advantage if the companys board of directors were to seek to sell the company in the future because tccc would not need to pay a control premium on the shares it owns at such time. tccc and the company would also be permitted to terminate tcccs distribution coordination agreements with the company after a change in control of the company. in such event, tccc would receive a termination fee if tccc terminated the distribution coordination agreements following a change in control of the company involving certain tccc competitors, or if the company terminated following a change in control of the company involving any third-party.
the interests of tccc may be different from or conflict with the interests of the companys other shareholders and, as a result, tcccs influence may result in the delay or prevention of potential actions or transactions, including a potential change of management or control of the company, even if such action or transaction may be beneficial to the companys other shareholders. moreover, tcccs ownership of a significant amount of the companys outstanding common shares could result in downward pressure on the trading price of the companys common shares if tccc were to sell a large portion of its shares (when permitted to sell) or as a result of the perception that such a sale might occur.
20
changes in government regulation, or failure to comply with existing regulations, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the u.s. federal, state and/or municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy drinks (including, prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental programs), limit the content of caffeine and other ingredients in beverages, require certain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose excise taxes, limit product size or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy drinks. for a discussion of certain of such legislation, see part i, item 1  business  government regulation. furthermore, additional legislation may be introduced in the united states and other countries at the federal, state, local and municipal level in respect of each of the foregoing subject areas.  public health officials and health advocates are increasingly focused on the public health consequences associated with obesity, especially as it affects children, and are seeking legislative change to reduce the consumption of sweetened beverages.  there also has been an increased focus on caffeine content in beverages. to the extent any such legislation is enacted in one or more jurisdictions where a significant amount of our products are sold individually or in the aggregate, it could result in a reduction in demand for, or availability of, our energy drinks, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the production, distribution and sale in the united states of many of our products are also currently subject to various federal and state regulations, including, but not limited to: the fd&c act; the occupational safety and health act; various environmental statutes; california proposition 65; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. outside the united states, the production, distribution and sale of many of our products are also subject to numerous statutes and regulations.  if a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product, its label, or a production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or such products may have to be recalled, reformulated and/or have the packaging changed, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we cannot predict the effect of inquiries from and/or actions by attorneys general, other government agencies and/or quasi-government agencies into the production, advertising, marketing, promotion, labeling, ingredients, usage and/or sale of our energy drink products.
we are subject to the risks of investigations and/or enforcement actions by state attorneys general and/or other government and/or quasi-governmental agencies relating to the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of our energy drinks. for example, in july 2012, we received a subpoena from the new york state attorney general in connection with an investigation relating to the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and sale of our monster energy® brand energy drinks. we cannot predict the outcome of this inquiry and what, if any, effect it may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. if an inquiry by a state attorney general or other government or quasi-government agency finds that our products and/or the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and/or sale of such products are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, we may become subject to fines, product reformulations, container changes, changes in the usage or sale of our energy drink products and/or changes in our advertising, marketing and promotion practices, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
21
in addition, from time to time, government and/or quasi-governmental agencies may investigate the safety of caffeine and energy drinks. for example, in january 2013, the company received and responded to inquiries from u.s. legislators in response to fdas investigation into the safety of caffeine in food products, particularly its effects on children and adolescents. these legislators ultimately released a report in january 2015, recommending, inter alia, that the energy drink industry not market to consumers under the age of 18 and not market their products for hydration, and that the fda develop and release definitions and guidance for this market sector.  in addition, other organizations, such as the european food safety authority, have also published reports, studies, articles and opinions on caffeine and energy drinks.
litigation regarding our products, and related unfavorable media attention, could expose us to significant liabilities and reduce demand for our products.
we have been and are currently named as a defendant in personal injury lawsuits which allege that consumption of our products has been responsible for wrongful deaths and/or injuries. we do not believe that our products are responsible for such wrongful deaths and/or injuries, and we intend to vigorously defend such lawsuits.
in july 2012, we received a subpoena from the attorney general for the state of new york in connection with an investigation relating to the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and sale of our monster energy® brand energy drinks. on august 6, 2014, the attorney general for the state of new york issued a second subpoena seeking additional documents and the deposition of a company employee. we have complied with both subpoenas. we cannot predict the outcome of this inquiry and what, if any, effect it may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
several other lawsuits have been filed against us claiming that certain statements made in our advertisements and/or on the labels of our products were false and/or misleading or otherwise not in compliance with food standards under local law, and/or that our products are not safe. putative class action lawsuits have also recently been filed against certain of our competitors asserting that certain claims in their advertisements amount to false advertising. we do not believe any statements made by us in our promotional materials or set forth on our product labels are false or misleading or noncompliant with local law, or that our products are in any way unsafe and we vigorously defend these lawsuits.
any of the foregoing matters or other litigation, the threat thereof, or unfavorable media attention arising from pending or threatened product-related litigation could consume significant financial and managerial resources and result in decreased demand for our products, significant monetary awards against us and injury to our reputation.
criticism of our energy drink products and/or criticism or a negative perception of energy drinks generally, could adversely affect us.
an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine, such as those related to obesity, or criticism or negative publicity regarding the caffeine content and/or any other ingredients in our products or energy drinks generally, including product safety concerns, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. articles critical of the caffeine content and/or other ingredients in energy drinks and/or articles indicating certain health risks of energy drinks have been published in recent years. we believe the overall growth of the energy drink market in the u.s. may have been negatively impacted by the ongoing negative publicity and comments that continue to appear in the media questioning the safety of energy drinks, and suggesting limitations on their ingredients (including caffeine), and/or the levels thereof, and/or imposing minimum age restrictions for consumers. in early 2018, certain retailers in the united kingdom announced the introduction of voluntary retailer measures to prevent the sale of energy drinks to individuals under the age of 16. if reports, studies or articles critical of caffeine and/or energy drinks continue to be published or are published in the future, or additional voluntary measures are taken, they could adversely affect the demand for our products.
22
increased competition could hurt our business.
the beverage industry is highly competitive. the principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, development of new products, flavors, product positioning as well as promotion and marketing strategies. our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, some of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do.
important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of our products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new and unique cutting edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. our products compete with all liquid refreshments and in some cases with products of much larger and substantially better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers such as tccc, pepsico, red bull gmbh and the dps group. we also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily national or local in operations. our products also compete with private-label brands such as those carried by grocery store chains, convenience store chains and club stores.
due to competition in the beverage industry, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in maintaining our current revenues, market share or position in the beverage industry. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
our inability to innovate successfully and to provide new cutting edge products could adversely affect our business and financial results.
our ability to compete in the highly competitive beverage industry and to achieve our business growth objectives depends, in part, on our ability to develop new flavors, products and packaging. the success of our innovation, in turn, depends on our ability to identify consumer trends and cater to consumer preferences. if we are not successful in our innovation activities, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected.
uncertainty in the financial markets and other adverse changes in general economic or political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.
global economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. there can be no assurance that economic improvements will occur, or that they would be sustainable, or that they would enhance conditions in markets relevant to us. in addition, we cannot predict the duration and severity of disruptions in any of our markets or the impact they may have on our customers or business, as our expansion outside of the united states has increased our exposure to any developments or crisis in african, asian, european and other international markets. if economic conditions deteriorate, our industry, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
changes in consumer preferences may reduce demand for some of our products.
the beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect us. there is increasing awareness of and concern for the health consequences of obesity. this may reduce demand for our non-diet beverages, which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations. recently, concerns have emerged regarding diet sodas and in particular, aspartame, which is contained in certain of our strategic brands energy drinks.
23
consumers are seeking greater variety in their beverages. our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that appeal to consumers. in order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of taste, quality and price, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. there is no assurance that consumers will continue to purchase our products in the future. product lifecycles for some beverage brands, products and/or packages may be limited to a few years before consumers preferences change. the beverages we currently market are in varying stages of their product lifecycles, and there can be no assurance that such beverages will become or remain profitable for us. we may be unable to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives. we may also be unable to penetrate new markets. if our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
our continued expansion outside of the united states exposes us to uncertain conditions and other risks in international markets.
we have continued expanding our operations internationally into a variety of new markets, including launches in china and various african and middle eastern countries. our gross sales to customers outside of the united states were approximately 28%, 25% and 23% of consolidated gross sales for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. as our growth strategy includes further expanding our international business, if we are unable to continue to expand distribution of our products outside the united states, our growth rate could be adversely affected. in many international markets, we have limited operating experience and in some areas we have no operating experience. it is costly to establish, develop and maintain international operations and develop and promote our brands in international markets. our percentage gross profit margins in many international markets are expected to be less than the comparable percentage gross profit margins obtained in the united states. we face and will continue to face substantial risks associated with having foreign operations, including; economic and/or political instability in our international markets; restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the united states, including possible taxes and/or withholding obligations on any repatriations; and tariffs and/or trade restrictions. these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. also, our operations outside of the united states are subject to risks relating to appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations, higher product damages, particularly when products are shipped long distances, potentially higher incidence of fraud and/or corruption, credit risk of local customers and distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences.
global or regional catastrophic events could impact our operations and affect our ability to grow our business.
because of our increasingly global presence, our business could be affected by unstable political conditions, civil unrest, large-scale terrorist acts, especially those directed against the united states or other major industrialized countries where our products are distributed, the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities, major natural disasters or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases. such events could impact the production and/or distribution of our products. in addition, such events could disrupt global or regional economic activity, which could affect consumer purchasing power, thereby reducing demand for our products. if we are unable to grow our business internationally as a result of these factors, our growth rate could decline.
24
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our operating results.
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, expenses, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. we may enter into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. we have not used instruments to hedge against all foreign currency risks and are therefore not protected against all foreign currency fluctuations. as a result, our reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. moreover, any favorable impacts to profit margins or financial results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be unsustainable over time. foreign currency transaction losses were $3.3 million, $9.7 million and $5.5 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
we rely on bottlers and other contract packers to manufacture our products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our bottlers and contract packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer.
our acquisition of aff brought our primary flavor supplier in-house for the majority of our monster energy® brand energy drinks. however, we also procure flavors from other independent flavor suppliers. we do not manufacture finished goods, but instead outsource manufacturing of our finished goods to bottlers and other contract packers. as a result, in the event of a disruption and/or delay, we may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period. in addition, there are limited alternative packing facilities in our domestic and international markets with adequate capacity and/or suitable equipment for many of our products, including our monster energy® brand energy drinks, our muscle monster® product line, our java monster® product line, our espresso monstertm product line, our monster hydro® product line and certain of our other products. for example, in the second half of 2016 and into the fourth quarter of 2017, sales of our java monster® and muscle monster® product lines were adversely impacted by production capacity constraints resulting from production and maintenance issues with certain of our co-packers. while this short-term disruption in production did not significantly affect our revenues, a lengthy disruption or delay in the production of any our products could significantly adversely affect our revenues from such products because alternative co-packing facilities in the united states and abroad with adequate long-term capacity may not be available for such products either at commercially reasonable rates and/or costs and/or within a reasonably short time period, if at all.
we rely on bottlers and distributors to distribute our products. if we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing bottlers and distributors and/or secure such bottlers and distributors, our business could suffer.
many of our bottlers/distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other soda, carbonated and non-carbonated brands and other beverage products (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic). in many cases, such products compete directly with our products.
unilateral decisions could be taken by our bottlers/distributors, convenience and gas chains, grocery chains, specialty chain stores, club stores and other customers, to discontinue carrying certain or all of our products that they are carrying at any time, which could cause our business to suffer.
the tccc north american bottlers, coca-cola european partners, coca-cola hellenic and coca-cola femsa are our primary domestic and international distributors of our products. as a result, if we are unable to maintain good relationships with the tccc north american bottlers, coca-cola european partners, coca-cola hellenic and/or coca-cola femsa, or if the tccc north american bottlers, coca-cola european partners, coca-cola hellenic and/or coca-cola femsa do not effectively focus on marketing, promoting, selling and distributing our products, sales of our products could be adversely affected.
25
tccc, through the tccc subsidiaries, accounted for approximately 18%, 41% and 43% of our net sales for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. a decision by certain tccc north american bottlers (including ccbcc operations, llc), coca-cola european partners, coca-cola hellenic, coca-cola femsa, wal-mart, inc. (including sams club), or any other large customer to decrease the amount purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.
the marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. if our brands prove to be less attractive to our existing bottlers and distributors, if we fail to attract additional bottlers and distributors, and/or our bottlers and/or distributors do not market, promote and distribute our products effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
increases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials and/or ingredients and/or fuel and/or costs of co-packing could harm our business.
the principal raw materials used by us are aluminum cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cap cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable ends, pet plastic bottles, pet plastic cans, glass bottles, flavors, juice concentrates, glucose, sugar, sucralose, milk, cream, protein, dietary ingredients and other packaging materials, the costs and availability of which are subject to fluctuations. in addition, certain of our co-packing arrangements allow such co-packers to increase their charges based on certain of their own cost increases. we are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients, certain of which have recently risen, will continue to rise or may rise in the future. we are unsure whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials, although we do, from time to time, enter into purchase agreements for a significant portion of our annual anticipated requirements for certain raw materials such as aluminum cans, glucose, sugar and sucralose.
in addition, some of these raw materials, including certain sizes of cans, are available from limited suppliers.
our failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results.
we may not correctly estimate demand for our existing products and/or new products. our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with regard to new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly in new markets. if we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including, but not limited to, aluminum cans, aluminum cap cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable ends, pet plastic bottles, pet plastic cans, glass bottles, labels, sucralose, flavors, dietary ingredients, juice concentrates, certain sweeteners, coffee, tea, protein and packaging materials or experience difficulties with our co-packing arrangements, including production shortages or quality issues, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. moreover, industry-wide shortages of certain juice concentrates, dietary ingredients and sweeteners have been and could, from time to time in the future, be experienced, resulting in production fluctuations and/or product shortages. we generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage this risk. such shortages could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.
26
if we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels, if we are unable to deliver our products to our customers in sufficient quantities, and/or if our customers or retailers inventory levels are too high, our operating results could be adversely affected.
if we do not accurately anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will take to obtain new inventory, our inventory levels may be inadequate and our results of operations may be negatively impacted. if we fail to meet our shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships with distributors and/or retailers, increase our distribution costs and/or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost. in order to be able to deliver our products on a timely basis, we need to maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products. if the inventory of our products held by our distributors and/or retailers is too high, they will not place orders for additional products, which could unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results.
the costs of packaging supplies are subject to price increases from time to time, and we may be unable to pass all or some of such increased costs on to our customers.
many of our packaging supply contracts allow our suppliers to alter the costs they charge us for packaging supplies based on changes in the costs of the underlying commodities that are used to produce those packaging supplies, such as aluminum for cans and pulp and paper for cartons and/or trays. these changes in the prices we pay for our packaging supplies occur at certain predetermined times that vary by product and supplier. in some cases, we are able to fix the prices of certain packaging supplies and/or commodities for a reasonable period. in other cases, we bear the risk of increases in the costs of these packaging supplies, including the underlying costs of the commodities that comprise these packaging supplies. we do not use derivative instruments to manage this risk. if the costs of these packaging supplies increase, we may be unable to pass these costs along to our customers through corresponding adjustments to the prices we charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
our intellectual property rights are critical to our success, and the loss of such rights could materially adversely affect our business.
we own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. we also own the copyright in, and to, a portion of the content on the packaging of our products. we regard our trademarks, copyrights, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and attempt to protect such intellectual property through registration and enforcement actions. however, there can be no assurance that other parties will not infringe or misappropriate our trademarks, copyrights and similar proprietary rights. if we lose some or all of our intellectual property rights, our business may be materially adversely affected.
if we are unable to maintain our brand image or product quality, our business may suffer.
our success depends on our ability to build and maintain the brand image for our existing products, new products and brand extensions. there can be no assurance that our advertising, marketing and promotional programs will have the desired impact on our products brand image and on consumer preference and demand. product quality and/or ingredient content issues, efficacy or lack thereof, (real or imagined), or allegations of product contamination, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. furthermore, our brand image or perceived product quality could be adversely affected by litigation, unfavorable reports in the media (internet or elsewhere), studies in general and regulatory or other governmental inquiries, (in each case whether involving our products or those of our competitors) and proposed or new legislation affecting our industry.
if we encounter product recalls, our business may suffer and we may incur material losses.
we may be required from time to time to recall products entirely or from specific co-packers, markets or batches if such products become contaminated, damaged, mislabeled or otherwise materially non-compliant with applicable regulatory requirements. material product recalls could adversely affect our profitability and our brand image. we do not maintain recall insurance.
27
if we are not able to retain the full-time services of senior management there may be an adverse effect on our operations and/or our operating performance until we find suitable replacements.
our business is dependent, to a large extent, upon the services of our senior management. we do not maintain key person life insurance on any members of our senior management. the loss of services of either mr. sacks, chairman and chief executive officer, mr. schlosberg, president and chief financial officer, or any other key members of our senior management could adversely affect our business until suitable replacements can be found. there may be a limited number of personnel with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and we may be unable to locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms.
climate change may negatively affect our business.
there is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures could cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. while warmer weather has historically been associated with increased sales of our products, changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions, which may limit availability and/or increase the cost of certain key ingredients, juice concentrates and dietary and other ingredients used in our products. increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain (including, without limitation, the availability of, and/or result in higher prices for, juice concentrates, natural flavors and dietary and other ingredients) and/or impact demand for our products. in addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. as a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. sales of our products may also be influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. weather conditions may influence consumer demand for certain of our beverages, which could have an adverse effect on our operations.
potential changes in accounting standards or practices and/or taxation may adversely affect our financial results.
we cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on our financial results. new accounting standards could be issued that change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. these changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported earnings. increases in direct and indirect income tax rates could affect after-tax income. equally, increases in indirect taxes (including environmental taxes pertaining to the disposal of beverage containers and/or indirect taxes on beverages generally or energy drinks in particular) could affect our products affordability and reduce our sales.
fluctuations in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
we are subject to income taxes in both the u.s. and certain foreign jurisdictions. therefore, we may be subjected to audits for multiple tax years in various jurisdictions at once. at any given time, events may occur which change our expectation about how any such tax audits will be resolved and thus, there could be variability in our quarterly and/or annual tax rates, because these events may change our plans for uncertain tax positions. on december 22, 2017, the president of the united states signed into law the tax and jobs act (the tax reform act) which imposes broad and complex changes to the u.s. tax code. while we have provided a provisional estimate of the effect of the tax reform act in our financial statements, in particular as it relates to the reduction of our net deferred tax assets, actual amounts may vary materially from these estimates due to a number of uncertainties and factors, including further analysis and clarification of the tax reform act that cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

volatility of stock price may restrict sale opportunities.
our stock price is affected by a number of factors, including stockholder expectations, financial results, the introduction of new products by us and our competitors, general economic and market conditions, estimates and projections by the investment community and public comments by other parties as well as many other factors including litigation, many of which are beyond our control. we do not provide guidance on our future performance, including, but not limited to, our revenues, margins, product mix, operating expenses or net income. we may be unable to achieve analysts net revenue and/or earnings forecasts, which are based on their own projected revenues, sales volumes and sales mix of many product types and/or new products, certain of which are more profitable than others, as well as their own estimates of gross margin and operating expenses. there can be no assurance that we will achieve any such projected levels or mixes of product sales, revenues, gross margins, operating profits and/or net income. as a result, our stock price is subject to significant volatility, and stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices. in addition, periods of volatility in the market price of our stock could result in the initiation of securities class action litigation against us. during the fiscal year ended december 31, 2017, the high of our stock price was $64.79 and the low was $41.02.
provisions in our organizational documents and control by insiders may prevent changes in control even if such changes would be beneficial to other stockholders.
our organizational documents may limit changes in control. furthermore, as of february 12, 2018, mr. sacks and mr. schlosberg together may be deemed to beneficially own and/or exercise voting control over approximately 9.3% of our outstanding common stock. as of february 12, 2018, tccc owned approximately 18.0% of our common stock. consequently, mr. sacks, mr. schlosberg and tccc could exercise significant control over matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including electing directors, amending organizational documents and disapproving extraordinary transactions such as a takeover attempt, even though such actions may be favorable to the other common stockholders.
our cash flow may not be sufficient to fund our long-term goals.
although we currently have sufficient cash to support our planned operating activities in the current year, we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to support our capital expenditure plans and general operating activities in the future. in addition, the terms and/or availability of our credit facility and/or the activities of our debtors and/or creditors could affect the financing of our future growth.
our investments in marketable securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments.
at december 31, 2017, we had $528.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, $672.9 million in short-term investments and $2.4 million of long-term investments. we have historically invested these amounts in u.s. treasury bills, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, government agencies and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), variable rate demand notes and money market funds meeting certain criteria. certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. these risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired.
under gaap, we are required to review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include, declining or slower than anticipated growth rates for certain of our existing products, a decline in stock price and market capitalization, and slower growth rates in our industry.
29
we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which we determine that our intangible assets have been impaired. any such charge would adversely impact our results of operations. as of december 31, 2017, our goodwill totaled approximately $1,331.6 million and our intangible assets totaled approximately $1,034.1 million.
if we fail to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on a consolidated basis, our stock price and investor confidence in the company could be materially and adversely affected.
we are required to maintain both disclosure controls and procedures as well as internal control over financial reporting that are effective for the purposes described in part ii, item 9a  controls and procedures. if we fail to maintain such controls and procedures, our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or the value of our stock could be materially harmed.
litigation, legal proceedings, government and regulatory inquiries and/or proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and thus negatively affect our financial results.
we are a party, from time to time, to various litigation claims and legal proceedings, government and regulatory inquiries and/or proceedings, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, fraud, unfair business practices, false advertising, product liability, breach of contract claims, securities actions and shareholder derivative actions. material legal proceedings are described more fully in, part i, item 3  legal proceedings and in part ii, item 8, note 11 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this form 10-k.
defending these proceedings can result in significant ongoing expenditures and the diversion of our managements time and attention from the operation of our business, which could have a negative effect on our business operations. our failure to successfully defend or settle any litigation or legal proceedings could result in liabilities that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenue and profitability, and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.
we must continually maintain, protect and/or upgrade our information technology systems, including, protecting us from internal and external cybersecurity threats.
information technology enables us to operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency and accurately produce our financial statements. if we do not appropriately allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, and/or the loss of and/or damage to intellectual property through security breaches, including internal and external cybersecurity threats. cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software (malware and virus), attempts to gain unauthorized access to networks, computer systems and data and other forms of electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in business systems, an inability to process customer orders and/or lost customer orders, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures including ongoing  cybersecurity risk assessments to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technology-related disruptions. however, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to operational interruption, damage to our brand image and private data exposure. moreover, if our data management systems, including our sap enterprise resource planning system, do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business (whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, cybersecurity attack and/or human error), our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results.

our business acquisitions and divestitures on april 1, 2016, we completed our acquisition of flavor supplier and long-time business partner american fruits & flavors (aff), in an asset acquisition that brought our primary flavor supplier in-house, secured the intellectual property of our most important flavors in perpetuity and further enhanced our flavor development and global flavor footprint capabilities (the aff transaction). pursuant to the terms of the aff transaction, we purchased aff for $688.5 million in cash after adjustments. (see note 2 acquisitions and divestitures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements).
we incurred $4.5 million in aff transaction related expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016.
on june 12, 2015, we completed the tccc transaction which provided for a long-term strategic relationship in the global energy drink category with tccc. as part of the tccc transaction, we transitioned certain distribution rights to tcccs distribution network.
36
in accordance with fasb asc no. 420 exit or disposal cost obligations, we expense distributor termination costs in the period in which the written notification of termination occurs.  we incurred distributor termination costs of $35.4 million, $79.8 million and $224.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. such termination costs have been expensed in full and are included in operating expenses for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. we recognized as income $0.6 million, $5.7 million and $39.8 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the accelerated amortization of the deferred revenue balances associated with certain of our prior distributors who were sent notices of termination during the relevant periods.
we incurred $15.5 million in tccc transaction related expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015. we incurred no tccc transaction related expenses for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016.

on december 22, 2017, the president of the united states signed into law the tax reform act.  the legislation significantly changes u.s. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.  the tax reform act permanently reduces the u.s. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective january 1, 2018. as a result of the reduction in the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the tax reform act, we revalued our net deferred tax assets at december 31, 2017, resulting in a provisional $39.8 million charge included in the provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2017. the tax reform act also provided for a one-time deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits (e&p) through the year ended december 31, 2017.  as a result, we recognized a provisional $2.1 million charge in the provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2017 related to the deemed mandatory repatriation.

subsequent to december 31, 2017, we introduced caffé monstertm vanilla, caffé monstertm mocha and caffé monstertm salted caramel.
in the normal course of business we discontinue certain products and/or product lines. those products or product lines discontinued in 2017, either individually or in aggregate, did not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
our net sales of $3,369.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 represented record annual net sales. the vast majority of our net sales are derived from our monster energy® brand energy drinks. net sales of our monster energy® brand energy drinks were $3,035.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of $287.4 million, or 89.9% of our overall increase in net sales for the year ended december 31, 2017. any decrease in net sales of our monster energy® brand energy drinks could have a significant adverse effect on our future revenues and net income. competitive pressure in the energy drink category could also adversely affect our operating results. net sales of our strategic brands acquired as part of the tccc transaction were $299.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2017.
net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the monster energy® drinks segment of approximately $7.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on net sales in the strategic brands segment of approximately $3.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2017.
our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. gross sales to customers outside the united states amounted to $1,094.8 million, $888.7 million and $713.2 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. such sales were approximately 28%, 25% and 23% of gross sales for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on gross sales to customers outside the united states of approximately 1%, 3% and 14% for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
our customers are primarily full service beverage bottlers/distributors, retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, food service customers and the military. percentages of our gross sales to our various customer types for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are reflected below. such information includes sales made by us directly to the customer types concerned, which include our full service beverage bottlers/distributors in the united states. such full service beverage bottlers/distributors in turn sell certain of our products to some of the same customer types listed below. we limit our description of our customer types to include only our sales to our full service bottlers/distributors without reference to such bottlers/distributors sales to their own customers.

our customers include the tccc north american bottlers (including ccbcc operations, llc), coca-cola european partners, coca-cola hellenic, coca-cola femsa, coca-cola amatil, swire coca-cola group in china, cofco coca-cola group in china, coca-cola beverages africa, coca-cola içecek asahi soft drinks, co., ltd., kalil bottling group, wal-mart, inc. (including sams club), costco wholesale corporation, big geyser, inc. and select ab distributors. tccc, through the tccc subsidiaries, accounted for approximately 18%, 41% and 43% of our net sales for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. as part of the north america refranchising, the territories of certain tccc subsidiaries have been transitioned to certain independent/non wholly-owned tccc bottler/distributors. accordingly, our percentage of net sales classified as sales to the tccc subsidiaries decreased for the year ended december 31, 2017. ccbcc operations, llc accounted for approximately 13%, 9% and 6% of our net sales for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. a decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.
we continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors.
value drivers of our business we believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following:
·                 international growth  the introduction, development and sustained profitability of our monster energy® brand internationally remains a key value driver for our corporate growth. the tccc transaction is expected to secure fully aligned access to tcccs leading global distribution system, which we anticipate will accelerate our international performance. in addition, we anticipate that the tccc transaction will provide scale and platform synergies in a range of international geographies where we currently have limited presence, which is expected to increase our energy business in a number of international markets and establish a presence in additional countries for our monster energy® drinks brand.
·                 profitable growth  we believe functional value-added brands supported by marketing and innovation and targeted to a diverse consumer base, drive profitable growth.  we continue to broaden our family of products. in particular, we have expanded our range of energy drinks, including through the addition of tcccs existing energy product lines in connection with the tccc transaction, to provide more alternatives to consumers.  we are focused on increasing the profit margins for both our monster energy® drinks segment and our strategic brands segment, and believe that tailored branding, packaging, pricing and distribution channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. we are implementing these strategies with a view to continuing profitable growth.
40
·                 cost management  the principal focus of cost management will continue to be on reducing input procurement and production costs on a per-case basis, including raw material costs and co-packing fees, as well as reducing freight costs by securing additional co-packing facilities strategically localized. another key area of focus is to decrease promotional allowances, selling and general and administrative costs, including sponsorships, sampling, promotional and marketing expenses, as a percentage of net sales.
·                 efficient capital structure  our capital structure is designed to optimize our working capital in order to finance expansion, both domestically and internationally. we believe that with our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds, if necessary, at a relatively low effective cost of borrowings, provides a competitive advantage. the reduction of accounts receivable and inventory days on hand will remain an area of focus.
we believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when implemented and/or achieved in the united states and internationally, will result in: (1) improving or maintaining our product gross profit margins; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) enhancing our cost of capital. the ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations.
gross and net sales, gross profit, operating income, net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. these measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2017 and beyond (see part ii, item 7  results of operations  results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016).
as of december 31, 2017, the company had working capital of $1,526.0 million compared to $961.7 million as of december 31, 2016. the increase in working capital was primarily the result of retained profits reflected in an overall increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. for the year ended december 31, 2017, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $987.7 million as compared to $701.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. principal uses of cash flows in 2017, were purchases of investments, development of our monster energy® brand internationally and acquisition of real property and other property and equipment. these principal uses of cash flows are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds in the future (see part ii, item 7  liquidity and capital resources).
opportunities, challenges and risks looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks for the beverage industry and the company, including our significant commercial relationship with tccc and tcccs status as a significant shareholder of the company, in each case as described above under part i, item 1a  risk factors.
in addition, legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the u.s., state, county and/or municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy drinks (including prohibiting the sale of energy drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental programs), limit caffeine content in beverages, require certain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose taxes, limit product sizes or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy drinks. in addition, articles critical of the caffeine content in energy drinks and their perceived benefits and articles indicating certain health risks of energy drinks have been published. the proposal and/or adoption of such legislation and the publication of such articles, or the future proposal and/or adoption of similar legislation or publication of similar articles, may adversely affect our company. in addition, uncertainty and/or volatility in our domestic and/or our international economic markets could negatively affect both the stability of our industry and our company. furthermore, our growth strategy includes
41
expanding our international business, which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting international operations, including the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. consumer discretionary spending also represents a challenge to the successful marketing and sale of our products. increases in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles continue to represent a challenge. we recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and low calorie beverages within our energy drink product line. we continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. (see part i, item 1a  risk factors).
our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages which have been positively accepted by consumers. our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that meet consumer preferences, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. in order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of price, quality, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. the beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences that may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences.
in addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our companys future financial results include, but are not limited to:
·                                                                                                       the risks associated with the realization of benefits from the tccc transaction;

·   changes in consumer preferences and demand for our products;
·   economic uncertainty in the united states, europe and other countries in which we operate;
·   the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;
·   maintenance of our brand image and product quality;
·   increasing concern over various health matters, including obesity, caffeine consumption and energy drinks generally, and changes in regulation and consumer preferences in response to those concerns;
·   profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (see part i, item 1  business  competition and part i, item 1  business  sales and marketing);
·   costs of establishing and promoting our brands internationally;
·   increase in costs of raw materials used by us;
·   restrictions on imports and sources of supply, duties or tariffs, changes in related government regulations and disruptions in the timely import or export of our products and/or ingredients due to port strikes, related labor issues or other importation impediments;
·   protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and copyrights and the continuous pursuit to develop and protect new and innovative trademarks and copyrights for our expanding product lines;
·   limitations on available quantities of certain package containers such as the aluminum 24-ounce cap-can and pet cans;
·   limitations on co-packing availability, particularly for retort production; and
·   the imposition of additional regulation, including regulation restricting the sale of energy drinks, limiting caffeine content in beverages, requiring product labeling and/or warnings, imposing excise taxes and/or sales taxes, and/or limiting product size and/or age restrictions.
see part i, item 1a  risk factors for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our company.
42
we believe that the following opportunities exist for us:
·                 domestic and international growth potential of our products due to our continued transition to a leading global distribution network and the scale and platform synergies expected in connection with the tccc transaction;
·                 growth potential of the energy drink category, both domestically and internationally;
·                 planned and future new product and product line introductions with the objective of increasing sales and/or contributing to higher profitability;
·                 the introduction of new package formats designed to generate strong revenue growth;
·                 package, pricing and channel opportunities to increase profitable growth;
·                 effective strategic positioning to capitalize on industry growth;
·                 broadening distribution/expansion opportunities in both domestic and international markets;
·                 launching and/or relaunching our products and new products into new geographic markets; and
·                 continued focus on reducing our cost base.

results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016.
net sales. net sales were $3,369.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $319.7 million, or 10.5% higher than net sales of $3,049.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase in net sales of our monster energy® brand energy drinks represented approximately $287.4 million of the overall increase in net sales. net sales of our monster energy® brand energy drinks increased partially due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased domestic and international consumer demand. net sales of our strategic brands were $299.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of $27.3 million, or 10.0% higher than net sales of $272.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. net sales of our aff third-party products were $21.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of $4.6 million, or 27.0% higher than net sales of $17.0 million (effectively from april 1, 2016 to december 31, 2016) for the year ended december 31, 2016. no other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the year ended december 31, 2017.
net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the monster energy® drinks segment of approximately $7.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on net sales in the strategic brands segment of approximately $3.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2017.
case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 360.0 million cases for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of approximately 39.0 million cases or 12.2% higher than case sales of 321.0 million cases for the year ended december 31, 2016. the overall average net sales per case (excluding net sales of aff third-party products of $21.6 million and $17.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as these sales do not have unit case equivalents) decreased to $9.30 for the year ended december 31, 2017, which was 1.6% lower than the average net sales per case of $9.45 for the year ended december 31, 2016. the lower average net sales price per case was primarily attributable to the changes in geographic sales mix.
net sales for the monster energy® drinks segment were $3,047.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $287.7 million, or 10.4% higher than net sales of $2,759.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016.
net sales for the strategic brands segment were $299.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $27.3 million, or 10.0% higher than net sales of $272.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2016.
net sales for the other segment were $21.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $4.6 million, or 27.0% higher than net sales of $17.0 million (effectively from april 1, 2016 to december 31, 2016) for the year ended december 31, 2016.
gross profit.  gross profit was $2,137.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $195.7 million, or 10.1% higher than the gross profit of $1,942.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 63.5% for the year ended december 31, 2017 from 63.7% for the year ended december 31, 2016.  the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the $287.4 million increase in net sales of our monster energy® brand energy drinks as well as an approximately $58.3 million increase in raw material cost savings for the year ended december 31, 2017 from the aff transaction. the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to geographical sales mix (our foreign operations generally have lower gross profit margins) and to certain increases in other costs, which were partially offset by raw material cost savings from the aff transaction and changes in domestic product sales mix.
45
operating expenses.  total operating expenses were $938.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $82.2 million, or 9.6% higher than total operating expenses of $856.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased payroll expenses of $40.5 million (of which $6.4 million was related to an increase in stock-based compensation), increased expenditures of $26.6 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased expenditures of $15.9 million for commissions, increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $11.1 million, increased expenditures of $9.9 million for allocated trade development and increased expenditures of $8.3 million for merchandise displays.  the increase in operating expenses was partially offset by the $44.3 million decrease in costs associated with distributor terminations and to decreased expenditures of $13.9 million for professional service fees, including legal and accounting costs.
contribution margin.  contribution margin for the monster energy® drinks segment was $1,264.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $116.2 million, or 10.1% higher than contribution margin of $1,148.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase in contribution margin for the monster energy® drinks segment was primarily the result of the $287.4 million increase in net sales of our monster energy® brand energy drinks as well an approximately $58.3 million increase in raw material cost savings for the year ended december 31, 2017 from the aff transaction.
contribution margin for the strategic brands segment was $174.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $11.3 million, or 7.0% higher than contribution margin of $163.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase in contribution margin for the strategic brands segment was primarily due to an increase in net sales.
contribution margin for the other segment was $5.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $3.3 million, or 143.3% higher than contribution margin of $2.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2016.
operating income.  operating income was $1,198.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $113.4 million, or 10.5% higher than operating income of $1,085.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. operating income as a percentage of net sales was 35.6% for both the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016. operating income was $139.3 million and $101.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, in connection with our operations in africa, asia, australia, europe, the middle east and south america.
other income (expense), net.  other non-operating income (expense), net, was $2.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, as compared to other non-operating income (expense), net of ($5.7) million for the year ended december 31, 2016. foreign currency transaction losses were $3.3 million and $9.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. interest income, net was $5.9 million and $4.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
provision for income taxes.  provision for income taxes was $380.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of $13.9 million, or 3.8% higher than the provision for income taxes of $367.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the effective combined federal, state and foreign tax rate decreased to 31.7% from 34.0% for the year ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase in profits earned by foreign subsidiaries in lower tax jurisdictions relative to the united states as well as to the increase in equity compensation deductions, due in part to the increase in the related excess tax benefits recorded in net income. the decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the recognition of $39.8 million of tax expense related to the revaluation of the u.s. net deferred tax asset at december 31, 2017, from 35% to the newly enacted u.s. corporate income tax rate of 21% due to the tax reform act enacted on december 22, 2017.
46

net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the monster energy® drinks segment of approximately $17.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily due to our operations in europe, mexico, canada and south africa, partially offset by our operations in japan. net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales in the strategic brands segment of approximately $4.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily due to our operations in europe.
case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 321.0 million cases for the year ended december 31, 2016, an increase of approximately 46.3 million cases or 16.9% higher than case sales of 274.6 million cases for the year ended december 31, 2015. the overall average net sales per case (excluding aff third-party products net sales of $17.0 million, as these sales do not have unit case equivalents) decreased to $9.45 for the year ended december 31, 2016, which was 4.7% lower than the average net sales per case of $9.91 for the year ended december 31, 2015. the lower net sales per case was primarily attributable to sales of concentrates and/or beverage bases in the strategic brands segment, which generally generate lower net operating revenues than products within the monster energy® drinks segment.
net sales for the monster energy® drinks segment were $2,759.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $241.4 million, or 9.6% higher than net sales of $2,518.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. no other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the year ended december 31, 2016.

contribution margin for the strategic brands segment was $163.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $73.3 million, or 81.6% higher than contribution margin of $89.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 (effectively from june 13, 2015 to december 31, 2015).

net income.  net income was $712.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, an increase of $165.9 million or 30.4% higher than net income of $546.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase in net income was primarily attributable to the $144.2 million decrease in costs associated with distributor terminations as well as the increase in gross profit of $309.7 million. the increase in net income was partially offset by the $161.5 million gain on the sale of monster non-energy for the year ended december 31, 2015 as well as an increase in the provision for income taxes of $22.2 million.

**gross sales is used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance, including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and overall company performance. the use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. we therefore believe that the presentation of gross sales provides a useful measure of our operating performance. gross sales is not a measure that is recognized under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with gaap, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting practices. in addition, gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers.

***although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with gaap and meet gaap requirements, the presentation thereof does not conform with gaap presentation requirements. additionally, our definition of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. promotional and other allowances primarily include consideration given to the companys bottlers/distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to, the following: (i) discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to the companys bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; (iii) the companys agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iv) the companys agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers; (v) incentives given to the companys bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; (vi) discounted or free products; (vii) contractual fees given to the companys bottlers/distributors related to sales made by the company direct to certain customers that fall within the bottlers/distributors sales territories; and (viii) commissions paid to our customers. the presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending levels incurred or correlated with such sales. promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. the companys promotional allowance programs with its numerous bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. these agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. the primary drivers of our promotional and other allowance activities for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were (i) to promote trial and increase sales volume, (ii) to address market conditions, and (iii) to secure shelf and display space at retail.
sales the table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years.  data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends.
sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. a unit case means a unit of measurement equal to 192 u.s. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). unit case volume means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of finished products or concentrates, as if converted into finished products, sold by us.
our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. it has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year. in addition, our experience with our energy drink products suggests they are less seasonal than the seasonality expected from traditional beverages. quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers, distributors and customers, changes in the sales mix of our products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.  (see part i, item 1  business  seasonality).

inflation we do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015.
liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities.  cash provided by operating activities was $987.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, as compared with cash provided by operating activities of $701.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2016.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $820.7 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses, consisting of $52.3 million of stock-based compensation and $48.9 million of depreciation and other amortization. for the year ended december 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities also increased due to a $125.0 million decrease in the tccc transaction receivables, a $67.9 million decrease in deferred income taxes, a $29.6 million increase in accounts payable, a $21.1 million increase in accrued promotional allowances, a $11.8 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $4.5 million increase in accrued compensation and a $4.7 million decrease in distributor receivables. for the year ended december 31, 2017, cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to a $71.3 million increase in prepaid income taxes, an $88.9 million increase in inventories, a $19.9 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $8.2 million decrease in accrued distributor terminations, a $4.5 million decrease in accrued liabilities, a $3.6 million decrease in income taxes payable and a $2.4 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $712.7 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses, consisting of $45.8 million of stock-based compensation and $40.8 million of depreciation and other amortization. for the year ended december 31, 2016, cash provided by operating activities also increased due to a $45.3 million increase in accounts payable, a $20.9 million decrease in inventories, a $13.8 million increase in deferred revenue, an $8.1 million increase in accrued compensation and a $4.4 million increase in income taxes payable. for the year ended december 31, 2016, cash used in operating activities was due to an $86.4 million increase in accounts receivable, a $48.0 million increase in prepaid income taxes, a $20.0 million increase in distributor receivables, a $19.1 million change in deferred income taxes, a $6.7 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $3.9 million decrease in accrued promotional allowances, a $3.3 million decrease in accrued distributor terminations and a $2.9 million decrease in accrued liabilities.

cash flows used in investing activities. net cash used in investing activities was $531.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to cash used in investing activities of $256.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2016.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of available-for-sale investments. for the year ended december 31, 2016, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to the purchase of aff as well as purchases of held-to-maturity investments. for the year ended december 31, 2017, cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to sales of available-for-sale investments. for the year ended december 31, 2016, cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to maturities of held-to-maturity investments. for both the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, cash used in investing activities also included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other equipment to support our marketing and promotional activities, production equipment, furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, real property, computer software, equipment used for sales and administrative activities, certain leasehold improvements and improvements to real property. we expect to continue to use a portion of our cash in excess of our requirements for operations for purchasing short-term and long-term investments, leasehold improvements, the acquisition of capital equipment (specifically, vans, trucks and promotional vehicles, coolers, other promotional equipment, merchandise displays, warehousing racks as well as items of production equipment required to produce certain of our existing and/or new products and to develop our brand in international markets) and for other corporate purposes. from time to time, we may also use cash to purchase additional real property related to our beverage business and/or acquire compatible businesses.
cash flows used in financing activities.  cash used in financing activities was $311.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to cash used in financing activities of $2,238.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the cash flows used in financing activities for both the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 was primarily the result of the repurchases of our common stock. the cash flows provided by financing activities for both the years ended december 31, 2017, and 2016 was primarily attributable to the issuance of our common stock.
purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment (including real property, personal property and coolers), leasehold improvements, advances for or the purchase of equipment for our bottlers, acquisition and maintenance of trademarks, payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash.
cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments  as of december 31, 2017, we had $528.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $675.3 million in short-term and long-term investments. we have historically invested these amounts in u.s. treasury bills, u.s. government agency securities and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), certificates of deposit, commercial paper, variable rate demand notes and money market funds meeting certain criteria. we maintain our investments for cash management purposes and not for purposes of speculation. our risk management policies emphasize credit quality (primarily based on short-term ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations) in selecting and maintaining our investments. we regularly assess market risk of our investments and believe our current policies and investment practices adequately limit those risks. however, certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. these risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
54
of our $528.6 million of cash and cash equivalents held at december 31, 2017, $266.5 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. no short-term or long-term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries at december 31, 2017. previously, amounts held by foreign subsidiaries were generally subject to u.s. income tax upon repatriation to the u.s. however, the tax reform act enacted in december 2017, requires us to pay a one-time deemed repatriation toll charge on cumulative undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not previously provided u.s. taxes. we estimated that our obligation associated with this one-time deemed repatriation toll charge to be $2.1 million, which was included in the provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2017. the $2.1 million will be paid in installments over eight years. as a result of the tax reform act, we can repatriate our cumulative undistributed foreign earnings back to the u.s. at any time with minimal u.s. income tax consequences, other than the one-time deemed repatriation toll charge and do not anticipate other material non-u.s. tax consequences resulting thereafter.
we believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources and our revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as purchases of capital assets, equipment and properties, through at least the next 12 months. based on our current plans, at this time we estimate that capital expenditures (exclusive of common stock repurchases) are likely to be approximately $100.0 million through december 31, 2018.  however, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate.

1contractual obligations include our obligations related to sponsorships and other commitments.
2purchase commitments include obligations made by us and our subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the production of our products. these obligations vary in terms, but are generally satisfied within one year.
in september 2016, we completed the acquisition of approximately 49 acres of land, located in rialto, ca, for a purchase price of approximately $39.1 million. in the fourth quarter of 2017, we completed the construction of an approximately 1,000,000 square-foot building (the rialto warehouse) on this land, which we anticipate will be leed certified, to replace our leased warehouse and distribution facilities located in corona, ca. we entered into an approximately $38.1 million guaranteed maximum price construction contract for the construction of the building, of which $4.6 million remained outstanding as of december 31, 2017.  during the three-months ended september 30, 2017, we transitioned our southern california warehouse and distribution operations to the rialto warehouse, which was fully operational by december 31, 2017.
55
in addition, $6.5 million of recognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of december 31, 2017.  it is expected that any change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefit within the next 12 months will not be significant.  in addition, $1.3 million of potential penalties and interest have been recorded as liabilities as of december 31, 2017.
accounting policies and pronouncements critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap.  gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. the following summarizes our most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices:
business combinations  business acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards board (fasb) accounting standards codification (asc) 805 business combinations.  fasb asc 805 requires the reporting entity to identify the acquirer, determine the acquisition date, recognize and measure the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and recognize and measure goodwill or a gain from the purchase. the acquirees results are included in the companys consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill. adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the measurement period (not longer than twelve months). the acquisition method also requires that acquisition-related transaction and post-acquisition restructuring costs be charged to expense and requires the company to recognize and measure certain assets and liabilities including those arising from contingencies and contingent consideration in a business combination.
cash and cash equivalents  the company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from date of purchase to be cash equivalents. throughout the year, the company has had amounts on deposit at financial institutions that exceed the federally insured limits. the company has not experienced any loss as a result of these deposits and does not expect to incur any losses in the future.
investments  the companys investments in debt securities are classified as either held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading, in accordance with fasb asc 320. held-to-maturity securities are those securities that the company has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. trading securities are those securities that the company intends to sell in the near term. all other securities not included in the held-to-maturity or trading category are classified as available-for-sale. held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value. trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses charged to earnings. available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders equity. fasb asc 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. fasb asc 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. under fasb asc 320-10-35, a security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the securitys amortized cost basis (the difference being defined as the credit loss) or if the fair value of the security is less than the securitys amortized cost basis and the investor intends, or will be required, to sell the security before recovery of the securitys amortized cost basis. if an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the charge to earnings is limited to the amount of credit loss if the investor does not intend to sell the security, and will not be required to sell the security, before recovery of the securitys amortized cost basis. any remaining difference between fair
56
value and amortized cost is recognized in other comprehensive loss, net of applicable taxes. the company evaluates whether the decline in fair value of its investments is other-than-temporary at each quarter-end. this evaluation consists of a review by management, and includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held, market and economic trends in the industry and information on the issuers financial condition and, if applicable, information on the guarantors financial condition. factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which the investments fair value has been less than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and guarantors, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value.
accounts receivable  the company evaluates the collectability of its trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. in circumstances where the company becomes aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations to the company, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount the company believes will ultimately be collected. in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on the companys recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding.  in accordance with fasb asc 210-20-45, in its consolidated balance sheets, the company has presented accounts receivable, net of promotional allowances, only for those customers that it allows net settlement. all other accounts receivable and related promotional allowances are shown on a gross basis.
inventories  inventories are valued at the lower of first-in, first-out, cost or market value (net realizable value).
property and equipment  property and equipment are stated at cost. depreciation of furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, computer software, equipment, and vehicles is based on their estimated useful lives (three to ten years) and is calculated using the straight-line method. amortization of leasehold improvements is based on the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases and is calculated using the straight-line method. normal repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. expenditures that materially increase values or extend useful lives are capitalized. the related costs and accumulated depreciation of disposed assets are eliminated and any resulting gain or loss on disposition is included in net income.
goodwill  the company records goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, including related tax effects. goodwill is not amortized; instead goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if the company believes indicators of impairment exist. the company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. if the company determines that the fair value is less than the carrying value, the company will use a two-step process to determine the amount of goodwill impairment. the first step requires comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. a potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value. the second step of the process, performed only if a potential impairment exists, involves determining the difference between the fair value of the reporting units net assets, other than goodwill, and the fair value of the reporting unit. an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value. for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 there were no impairments recorded.
57
other intangibles  other intangibles are comprised of trademarks that represent the companys exclusive ownership of the monster energy®, ®, monster energy ultra®, monster rehab®, mutant®, java monster®, unleash the beast!®, monster hydro®, espresso monstertm, caffé monstertm, monster energy extra strength nitrous technology®, muscle monster®, punch monster®, juice monster®,  m3(stylized)®, übermonster®, bu®, nalu®, nos®, full throttle®, burn®, mother®, ultra energy®, play® and power play(stylized)®, gladiator®, relentless®, samurai® and bpm® trademarks, all used in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages. the company also owns in its own right a number of other trademarks in the united states, as well as in a number of countries around the world. in addition, as a result of the aff transaction, we secured the intellectual property of our most important flavors for certain of our monster energy® brand energy drinks in perpetuity. in accordance with fasb asc 350, intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that an impairment exists. the company calculates impairment as the excess of the carrying value of its indefinite-lived assets over their estimated fair value. if the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value a write-down is recorded. the company amortizes its intangibles with finite useful lives over their respective useful lives. for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 there were no impairments recorded.
long-lived assets  management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain definite-lived intangible assets, for possible impairment. this review occurs annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.  if there is indication of impairment, management then prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. if these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. the fair value is estimated using the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with managements estimates of the business risks. preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on managements best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, there were no impairment indicators identified. long-lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
foreign currency translation and transactions  the accounts of the companys foreign subsidiaries are translated in accordance with fasb asc 830. foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in other expense, net, at the time they occur. net foreign currency exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the u.s. dollar are recorded as a part of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity. unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses on certain intercompany transactions that are of a long-term investment nature (i.e., settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future) are also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity. during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we entered into forward currency exchange contracts with financial institutions to create an economic hedge to specifically manage a portion of the foreign exchange risk exposure associated with certain consolidated subsidiaries non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities. all foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of december 31, 2017 have terms of one month or less. we do not enter into forward currency exchange contracts for speculation or trading purposes.
revenue recognition  the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
generally, ownership of, and title to, the companys finished products passes to customers upon delivery of the products to customers. certain of the companys distributors may also perform a separate function as a co-packer on the companys behalf. in such cases, ownership of and title to the companys products that are co-packed on the companys behalf by those co-packers who are also distributors, passes to such distributors when the company is notified by them that they have taken transfer or possession of the relevant portion of the companys finished goods.
58
revenue for the strategic brands segment is generally recognized when title to the concentrate is transferred to the customer. in particular, title to the concentrate usually passes upon shipment to the customers locations, as determined by the specific sales terms of the transactions.
net sales have been determined after deduction of promotional and other allowances in accordance with fasb asc 605-50. the companys promotional and other allowances are calculated based on various programs with its distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established during the year for the anticipated liabilities. these accruals are based on agreed upon terms as well as the companys historical experience with similar programs and require managements judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels. differences between such estimated expenses and actual expenses for promotional and other allowance costs have historically been insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. amounts received pursuant to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors, relating to the costs associated with terminating the companys prior distributors, are accounted for as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreement, generally 20 years.
the company also enters into license agreements that generate revenues associated with third-party sales of non-beverage products bearing our trademarks, including, but not limited to, clothing, hats, t-shirts, jackets, helmets and automotive wheels.
management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on the companys historical experience.
cost of sales  cost of sales consists of the costs of concentrates and/or beverage bases, the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of the companys finished products and certain quality control costs. raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales.  raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, flavors, ingredients and packaging materials.
operating expenses  operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses.  operating expenses also include such costs as payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees (including legal fees), termination payments made to certain of the companys prior distributors, depreciation and other general and administrative costs.
income taxes  the company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in fasb asc 740. under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. in determining the need for valuation allowances the company considers projected future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies. if in the future the company determines that it would not be able to realize its recorded deferred tax assets, an increase in the valuation allowance would be recorded, decreasing earnings in the period in which such determination is made.
the company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the companys evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. for those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. for those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.

item 1a.    risk factors the following discussion describes certain risk factors that we believe could affect our business and prospects. these risk factors are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report.
our results of operations could be adversely impacted by manufacturer pricing changes and fewer generic pharmaceutical launches.
in fiscal 2017, we experienced unfavorable trends in brand and generic pharmaceutical pricing which negatively impacted our pharmaceutical distribution services reportable segment profit and our consolidated operating earnings. those trends are expected to continue in fiscal 2018, and could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations.
certain distribution service agreements that we have entered into with branded and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to have an inflation-based compensation component to them. as a result, our gross profit from brand-name and generic manufacturers continues to be subject to fluctuation based upon the timing and extent of manufacturer price increases, which we do not control. if the frequency or rate of branded and generic pharmaceutical price increases slows, our results of operations could be adversely affected. in addition, generic pharmaceuticals are also subject to price deflation. if the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates, the negative impact on our results of operations will be greater. a decline in the number of generic pharmaceutical launches, or launches that are less profitable than those in the past, could also adversely impact our results of operations.
competition and industry consolidation may erode our profit.
as described in greater detail in the "competition" section beginning on page 5, the industries in which we operate are highly competitive. in addition, in recent years the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation, including among pharmaceutical manufacturers. if we do not compete successfully, it could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. the impact on us will be greater if consolidation among our customers, suppliers, and competitors gives the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power, which could lead to greater pressure on us to reduce prices for our products and services.
increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel and pharmaceutical compounding may increase our costs and reduce our profitability.
the healthcare industry in the united states is highly regulated at the federal and state levels. there have been increasing efforts by congress and state and federal agencies, including state boards of pharmacy, departments of health, and the fda, to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system and pharmacy compounding activities. regulation of pharmaceutical distribution is intended to prevent diversion and the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated, and/or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system. consequently, we are subject to the risk of changes in various federal and state laws, which include operating and security standards of the dea, the fda, various state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies. in recent years, some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety and security of the supply channel but that also may substantially increase the costs and burden of pharmaceutical distribution and pharmaceutical compounding.
at the federal level, final regulations issued pursuant to the prescription drug marketing act impose pedigree tracking and other chain of custody requirements that increase the costs and/or burden to us of selling to other pharmaceutical distributors and handling product returns. in addition, the fda amendments act of 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs. these standards include track-and-trace and/or authentication technologies that leverage 2d data matrix barcodes that are applied by the manufacturer to the sellable units and cases. the fda is also required to develop a standardized numerical identifier ("sni") for prescription drugs. in march 2010, the fda issued guidance regarding the development of snis for prescription drugs in which the fda mandated package-level snis, as an initial step in the fda's development of additional measures to secure the drug supply chain. in november 2013, congress passed the drug quality and security act ("dqsa"). the dqsa establishes federal traceability standards requiring drugs to be labeled and tracked at the lot level, preempts state drug pedigree requirements, and will eventually require all supply-chain stakeholders to participate in an electronic, interoperable prescription drug traceability system. the dsqa also establishes new requirements for drug wholesale distributors and third party logistics providers, including licensing requirements in states that had not previously licensed such entities.
one additional change resulting from the dqsa is the creation of section 503b outsourcing facilities as a new category for producers of compounded sterile preparations ("csps"), allowing such facilities to voluntarily register with the fda. our csp business locations have registered with the fda as section 503b outsourcing facilities and have implemented policies and procedures to achieve compliance with current dqsa requirements for such facilities. however, there can be no assurance that
8
we are fully compliant with the new requirements, and any failure to comply may result in additional costs to bring our csp facilities into compliance. moreover, the fda will continue to issue draft and final guidance and to promulgate regulations in its efforts to implement the requirements in the dqsa, including those relating to current good manufacturing practices ("gmps") and other matters related to 503b outsourcing facilities, which may require changes to our csp business, some of which may be significant. complying with these and other chain of custody and pharmaceutical compounding requirements will increase our costs and could otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.
legal, regulatory and legislative changes may adversely affect our business and results of operations.
both our business and our customers' businesses may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and/or medical treatments or services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined. additionally, on occasion, price increases on certain branded and generic pharmaceuticals have been the subject of u.s. congressional inquiries. any law or regulation impacting pharmaceutical pricing, including as a result of pricing controls or legislative efforts at the federal or state level, could adversely affect our operations.
federal insurance and health care reform legislation known as the affordable care act ("aca") became law in march 2010. the aca is intended to expand health insurance coverage, including coverage for at least a portion of drug costs, through a combination of insurance market reforms, an expansion of medicaid, subsidies, and health insurance mandates. the aca contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and reduce the costs of medicare and medicaid. given the scope of the changes made by the aca and the ongoing implementation efforts, we cannot predict the impact of every aspect of the law on our operations. likewise, we cannot predict the impact of any efforts to change or repeal any provisions of the aca.
the aca changed the formula for medicaid federal upper payment limits ("fuls") for multiple source drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to a limit of not less than 175% of the weighted average manufacturer price ("amp"). on february 1, 2016, cms published its final rule to implement the aca's medicaid covered outpatient drug provisions, under which cms calculates fuls for multiple source drugs as 175% of the weighted average of amps, with certain exceptions. in addition, the rule requires state medicaid programs to implement payment methods for brand (non-multiple source) products designed to be consistent with the actual acquisition cost of such drugs. the rule was generally effective on april 1, 2016, and states had until may 2016 to implement the fuls and have until april 1, 2017 to implement any changes necessary in light of the actual acquisition cost standard. medicaid reimbursement for drugs calculated under the final rule may represent significant reductions from prior reimbursement levels, although the impact of the changes depends upon how the changes are implemented by each state medicaid program. any reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for multisource pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability.
the aca also amended the medicaid rebate statute to increase minimum medicaid rebates paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers and made other changes expected to result in increased medicaid rebate payments by pharmaceutical manufacturers, which could indirectly impact our business. in addition, the bipartisan budget act of 2015 extended to generic drugs inflation-based medicaid drug rebates similar to those that are paid on brand drugs. the federal government and state governments could take other actions in the future that impact medicaid reimbursement and rebate amounts or the cost of drugs.
there can be no assurance that recent or future changes in medicaid prescription drug reimbursement policies will not have an adverse impact on our business. unless we are able to develop plans to mitigate the potential impact of these legislative and regulatory changes, these changes in reimbursement and related reporting requirements could adversely affect our results of operations.
the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 significantly expanded medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs through the medicare part d program. the part d program has increased the use of pharmaceuticals in the supply channel, which has had a positive impact on our revenues and profitability. there have been additional legislative and regulatory changes to the part d program since its enactment. there can be no assurances that recent and future changes to the part d program will not have an adverse impact on our business.
the federal government may adopt measures in the future that would further reduce medicare and/or medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on health care entities. for instance, under the "sequestration" provision of the budget control act of 2011 (as amended), a 2% cut is being made to medicare provider and plan payments, generally effective for services provided on or after april 1, 2013. any future reductions in medicare reimbursement rates could negatively impact our customers' businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us. at this time, we can provide no assurances that future medicare and/or medicaid payment or policy changes, if adopted, would not have an adverse effect on our business.
9
our business may be adversely affected in the future by the impact of declining reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and other economic factors.
our pharmaceutical distribution services segment sells specialty drugs directly to physicians and community oncology practices and provides a number of services to or through physicians. drugs that are administered in a physician's office, such as drugs that are infused or injected, are typically covered under medicare part b. declining reimbursement rates for medicare part b drugs and other economic factors have caused a number of physician practices, including some of our customers, to move from private practice to hospital settings, where they may purchase their specialty drugs under hospital prime vendor arrangements rather than from specialty distributors. although this trend has slowed down in the past year, it could increase in the future due to various factors, including legislative and regulatory requirements that affect how cms reimburses for medicare part b drugs, as well as the ability of certain hospitals to purchase drugs at significant, statutorily-mandated discounts pursuant to the federal 340b drug discount program for groups of patients. in addition, federal changes in drug reimbursement policy could reduce the rate of reimbursement for drugs covered under medicare part b or physician services under medicare, which could negatively impact our customers' businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us, and thereby result in corresponding declines in our profitability. on september 20, 2017, cms issued a request for information seeking recommendations for payment models, which could include prescription drug models under medicare parts b and d and state medicaid programs. cms noted its interest in drug pricing and value-based purchasing models involving "novel arrangements between plans, manufacturers, and stakeholders across the supply chain." additionally, cms published a proposed rule on july 20, 2016 that would cut medicare outpatient hospital reimbursement for separately payable drugs (other than vaccines) purchased through the 340b drug pricing program at average sales price (asp) minus 22.5% (with certain exceptions), rather than asp plus 6%. cms finalized this rule on november 1, 2017. at this time, we can provide no assurances that future medicare reimbursement or policy changes, if adopted, would not have an adverse effect on our business.
changes to the u.s. healthcare environment may negatively impact our business and our profitability.
our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently existing in the united states. in recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending. these changes include an increased reliance on managed care; cuts in certain medicare funding affecting our healthcare provider customer base; consolidation of competitors, suppliers and customers; and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups. we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. some of these potential changes, such as a reduction in governmental funding at the state or federal level for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing, pharmaceutical compounding, healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services. we expect continued government and private payor pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing. changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers' pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability.
if we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud and abuse, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.
we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse. the federal government continues to strengthen its scrutiny of practices potentially involving healthcare fraud affecting medicare, medicaid and other government healthcare programs. our relationships with healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which, among other things, (i) prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare, medicaid or other government-sponsored healthcare programs and (ii) impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs. legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding, powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse, and these enforcement authorities were further expanded by the aca. while we believe that we are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, many of the regulations applicable to us, including those relating to marketing incentives offered in connection with pharmaceutical sales, are vague or indefinite, and have not been interpreted by the courts. they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations. if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare, medicaid, and other federal and state healthcare programs.
10
public concern over the abuse of opioid medications, including increased legal and regulatory action, could negatively affect our business.
certain governmental and regulatory agencies, as well as state and local jurisdictions, are focused on the abuse of opioid medications in the united states. state and local governmental agencies are investigating us, other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors, and others in the supply chain regarding our actions in connection with the distribution of opioid medications. in addition, multiple lawsuits have been filed against us and other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors alleging, among other claims, that we failed to provide effective controls and procedures to guard against the diversion of controlled substances, acted negligently by distributing controlled substances to pharmacies that serve individuals who abuse controlled substances, and failed to report suspicious orders of controlled substances in accordance with regulations. additional governmental entities have indicated an intent to sue. we have sophisticated systems in place to detect and report suspicious orders (including through the use of data analytics), engage in significant due diligence of customers, and are committed to diversion control efforts. while we are vigorously defending ourselves in these lawsuits, the allegations may negatively affect our business in various ways, including through increased costs and harm to our reputation. since these matters are at an early stage, we are unable to predict the outcome. the adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits or investigations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and the price of our common stock.
our business, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected by qui tam litigation or other legal proceedings.
our business involves the manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of healthcare products, which may cause us to become involved in legal disputes or proceedings. the defense and resolutions of these current and future proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. violations of various federal and state laws governing the marketing, sale, purchase, and dispensing of pharmaceutical products can result in criminal, civil, and administrative liability for which there can be significant financial damages, criminal and civil penalties, and possible exclusion from participation in federal and state health programs. any settlement, judgment or fine that is in excess of our insurance limits, or that is not otherwise covered, could adversely affect our results of operations.
among other things, statutory and/or regulatory violations can form the basis for qui tam complaints to be filed. the qui tam provisions of the federal and various state civil false claims acts authorize a private person, known as a relator, to file civil actions under these statutes on behalf of the federal and state governments. under false claims acts, the filing of a qui tam complaint by a relator imposes obligations on government authorities to investigate the allegations and determine whether or not to intervene in the action. such cases may involve allegations around the marketing, sale, purchase, and/or dispensing of branded and/or generic pharmaceutical products and wrongdoing in the marketing, sale, purchase, and/or dispensing of such products. such complaints are filed under seal and remain sealed until the applicable court orders otherwise.
we have learned that there are filings in one or more federal district courts that are under seal and may involve allegations against us (and/or our subsidiaries or businesses, including our group purchasing organization for oncologists and our oncology distribution business) relating to its distribution of certain pharmaceutical products to providers. with regard to any of these filings, our business, and results of operations could be adversely affected if qui tam complaints are filed against us for alleged violations of any health laws and regulations and damages arising from resultant false claims, if the litigation proceeds whether or not government authorities decide to intervene in any such matters and/or if we are found liable for all or any portion of violations alleged in any such matters.
our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows may suffer upon the loss, or renewal at less favorable terms, of a significant customer or group purchasing organization.
wba accounted for approximately 30% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017. express scripts accounted for approximately 15% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017. our top ten customers, including governmental agencies and gpos, represented approximately 66% of revenue in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017. we may lose a significant customer or gpo relationship if any existing contract with such customer or gpo expires without being extended, renewed, renegotiated or replaced or is terminated by the customer or gpo prior to expiration, to the extent such early termination is permitted by the contract. a number of our contracts with significant customers or gpos are typically subject to expiration each year and we may lose any of these customers or gpo relationships if we are unable to extend, renew, renegotiate or replace the contracts. the loss of any significant customer or gpo relationship could adversely affect our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows. additionally, from time to time, significant contracts may be renewed prior to their expiration date. if those contracts are renewed at less favorable terms, they may also negatively impact our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows.
11
the anticipated ongoing strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with wba may not be realized.
in may 2016, we extended to 2026 our strategic arrangement with wba - specifically, our distribution agreement under which we distribute drugs to walgreens pharmacies and our generics purchasing services arrangement under which walgreens boots alliance development gmbh ("wbad") provides a variety of services, including negotiating acquisition pricing with generic manufacturers on our behalf. this reflected our expectation that partnering strategically with wba would result in various benefits including, among other things, continued cost savings as a result of our generics purchasing services arrangement with wbad, as well as the potential for exploring innovation together and sharing best practices. the processes and initiatives needed to achieve and maintain these benefits are complex, costly and time-consuming. achieving the anticipated benefits from the arrangement on an ongoing basis is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties, including: the potential inability to realize and/or delays in realizing potential benefits resulting from participation in our generics purchasing services arrangement with wbad, including improved generic drug pricing and terms, improved service fees from generic manufacturers, cost savings, innovations, or other benefits due to its inability to negotiate successfully with generic manufacturers or otherwise to perform as expected; the potential disruption of our plans and operations as a result of the terms under which we extended the duration of the distribution agreement and generics purchasing services agreement, including any disruption of our cash flow and ability to return value to our stockholders in accordance with our past practices and any reduction in our operational, strategic or financial flexibility; potential changes in supplier relationships and terms; unexpected or unforeseen costs, fees, expenses and charges incurred by us related to the transaction or the overall strategic relationship; unforeseen changes in the economic terms under which we distribute pharmaceuticals to wba; and any potential issues that could impede our ability to continue to work collaboratively with wba in an efficient and effective manner in furtherance of the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of the relationship.
in addition, wba has the right, but not the obligation, under the transactions contemplated by the framework and shareholder agreements dated march 18, 2013 to make certain additional investments in our common stock. wba also has the right to sell any of the shares of our common stock that it has acquired so long as wba has held the shares beyond the requisite dates specified in the shareholder agreement. any sales in the public market of common stock currently held by wba or acquired by wba pursuant to open market purchases could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. we could also encounter unforeseen costs, circumstances, or issues with respect to the transactions and collaboration we anticipate pursuing with wba. many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased benefits and the diversion of management time and attention. if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected future benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and the price of our common stock.
a disruption in our distribution or generic purchasing services arrangements with wba could adversely affect our business and financial results.
we are the primary distributor of pharmaceutical products for wba. our generic pharmaceutical program has also benefited from the generics purchasing services arrangement with wba. if the operations of wba are seriously disrupted for any reason, whether by natural disaster, labor disruption, regulatory or governmental action, or otherwise, it could adversely affect our business and our sales and profitability. if the generics purchasing services arrangement does not continue to be successful, our margins and results of operations could also be adversely affected.
if our operations are seriously disrupted for any reason, we may have an obligation to pay or credit wba for failure to supply products. in addition, upon the expiration or termination of the distribution agreement or generics purchasing services arrangement, there can be no assurance that we or wba will be willing to renew, on terms favorable to us or at all.
in addition, our business may be adversely affected by any operational, financial or regulatory difficulties that wba experiences, including any disruptions of certain of its existing distribution facilities or retail pharmacies resulting from ongoing inspections by the dea and/or state regulatory agencies and possible revocation of the controlled substance registrations for those facilities and pharmacies.
tax legislation or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
we are a large corporation with operations in the united states and select global markets. as such, we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the u.s. federal, state and local governments, and of various foreign jurisdictions. from time to time, various legislative initiatives, such as the repeal of last-in, first-out ("lifo") treatment, may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions and/or our tax liabilities. there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives. we believe that our historical tax positions are consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and existing precedent. in addition, u.s. federal, state and local, as well as foreign, tax laws and
12
regulations, are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.
the suspension or revocation by federal or state authorities of any of the registrations that must be in effect for our distribution and 503b outsourcing facilities to purchase, compound, store, and/or distribute pharmaceuticals and controlled substances, the refusal by such authorities to issue a registration to any such facility, or any enforcement action or other litigation that arises out of our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing distribution and 503b outsourcing facilities may adversely affect our reputation, our business and our results of operations.
the dea, fda, and various other federal and state regulatory authorities regulate the distribution of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances and the compounding of pharmaceuticals that contain controlled substances. we are required to hold valid dea and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substances act and its implementing regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, compounding, holding and distribution of controlled substances. government authorities may from time to time investigate whether we are in compliance with various security and operating standards applicable to the distribution of controlled substances including whether we are adequately detecting and preventing the illegal diversion of controlled substances. although we have procedures in place that are intended to ensure compliance with such laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would conclude that our operations are compliant with applicable laws and regulations. if we were found to be non-compliant with such laws and regulations, federal and state authorities have broad enforcement powers, including (i) the ability to suspend our distribution centers' and 503b outsourcing facilities' licenses to distribute and compound pharmaceutical products (including controlled substances), (ii) seize or recall products, and (iii) impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations.
we have received, and may in the future receive, requests for information, letters and subpoenas from the dea, fda, various u.s. attorneys' offices of the u.s. department of justice, and/or state attorneys general and state regulatory authorities and agencies related to our distribution of controlled substances and our order monitoring program, which is designed to prevent and detect the illegal diversion of controlled substances, or other matters. we generally respond to subpoenas, requests, letters, and other authority and/or agency correspondence in a thorough and timely manner. these responses require time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred by us, such as costs related to addressing the observations listed on fda form 483 reports. such subpoenas, requests and letters can also lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of civil, criminal, or regulatory legal proceedings against us, as well as to settlements and the suspension or revocation of registrations required by our distribution and 503b outsourcing facilities, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations.
the fda and other governmental entities enforce compliance with applicable current gmp requirements through periodic risk-based inspections. it is common for fda form 483 reports to be provided in connection with inspections of 503b outsourcing facilities, and fda observations may be followed by warning letters or subsequent enforcement actions. prior to our acquisition of the business, pharmedium received a warning letter from the fda in 2014 following the inspection of pharmedium's mississippi, new jersey, tennessee and texas 503b outsourcing facilities in 2013. the fda reinspected all of these facilities in 2015 and 2016 and issued fda form 483 reports at each of the facilities as well as at pharmedium's headquarters in lake forest, illinois. we cannot be assured that the fda will be satisfied with the sufficiency or timing of pharmedium's corrective actions in response to the fda's form 483 reports, including pharmedium's meeting with the fda on november 18, 2016, and, as such, we cannot predict when or if the fda will consider the agency's observations to be fully resolved. a failure to adequately address observations identified by the fda in form 483 reports or warning letters issued by the fda or observations identified by any other federal and state regulatory authority, including a failure to resolve the observations identified by the fda in the 2014 warning letter and subsequent fda form 483 reports relating to pharmedium's 503b outsourcing facilities, could lead to an enforcement action, monetary penalties and/or license revocation, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations.
the products compounded by our csp business are administered by our customers to patients intravenously, and failures or errors in production, labeling or packaging could contribute to patient harm or death, which may subject us to significant liabilities and reputational harm.
the production, labeling, and packaging of csps is inherently risky. our csp business sells csps to acute care hospitals, freestanding hospital outpatient departments, and ambulatory surgery centers, who then administer the csps to patients intravenously or through other injectable routes of administration. there are a number of factors that could result in the injury or death of a patient who receives one of our csps, including quality issues, manufacturing or labeling flaws, improper packaging or unanticipated or improper uses of the products, any of which could result from human or other error. any of these situations could lead to a recall of, or safety alert relating to, one or more of our products. in addition, in the ordinary course of business, we may voluntarily recall or retrieve products. any recall or retrieval, whether voluntary or requested by the fda or state regulatory
13
authorities, could result in significant costs and negative publicity. negative publicity, including regarding a quality or safety issue, whether accurate or inaccurate, could reduce market acceptance of our products, harm our reputation, decrease demand for our products, result in the loss of customers, lead to product withdrawals, and harm our ability to successfully launch new products and services. these problems could also result in enforcement actions by state and federal authorities or other healthcare self-regulatory bodies, or product liability claims or lawsuits, including those brought by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class or establish multidistrict litigation proceedings. any such action, litigation, recall or reputational harm resulting from patient harm or death caused by csps prepared by a competitor or a hospital pharmacy could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. our current or future insurance coverage may prove insufficient to cover any liability claims brought against us. because of the increasing cost of insurance coverage, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.
we may not realize the expected benefits from our reorganization and other business process initiatives.
in june 2017 we announced a new organizational structure, described in the management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii, item 7 below, designed to further align the organization to its customer needs in a more seamless and unified way, while supporting corporate strategy, accelerating growth, and improving efficiency. there can be no assurance that we will realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits of these changes. our financial goals assume a level of productivity improvement from our business optimization initiatives. our ability to successfully manage and execute these initiatives and realize expected savings and benefits is important to our business success. the reorganization and other initiatives could yield unintended consequences such as distraction of our management and employees, business disruption, attrition, inability to attract or retain key personnel, and reduced employee productivity which could negatively affect our business, sales, financial condition, and results of operations. moreover, our restructuring and business process initiatives may result in charges and expenses that impact our operating results. there can be no assurance that the activities under any restructuring and business initiative will result in the desired benefits.
our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we undertake acquisitions of businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate.
as part of our strategy we seek to pursue acquisitions of other companies. at any particular time, we may be in various stages of assessment, discussion, and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions, not all of which will be consummated. we make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate and required by applicable securities laws and regulations.
acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties and may be of businesses in which we lack operational experience. if we complete one or more acquisitions, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: regulatory or compliance issues that could arise; changes in regulations and laws; the failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have projected in either the near or long term; the assumption of unknown liabilities, including litigation risks; the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed not being properly estimated; the difficulties of imposing adequate financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential liabilities that might arise pending the imposition of adequate controls; the difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies; and the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions.
violations of anti-bribery, anti-corruption and/or international trade laws to which we are subject could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations.
we are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business. for example, we are subject to the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (the "fcpa"), u.s. export control and trade sanction laws, and similar anti-corruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries, such as the u.k. bribery act, any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also cause a loss of reputation in the market. the fcpa generally prohibits u.s. companies and their officers, directors, employees, and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. the fcpa also requires that u.s. public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. if we are found to have violated the fcpa, we may face sanctions including civil and criminal fines, disgorgement of profits, and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with government agencies or receive export licenses. from time to time, we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our international business activities, compliance with which could be costly and time-consuming, and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, and results of operations.
14
our results of operations and our financial condition may be adversely affected by our global operations.
our operations in jurisdictions outside of the united states are subject to various risks inherent in global operations. we currently have operations in over 50 countries worldwide. we may conduct business in additional foreign jurisdictions in the future, which may carry operational risks in addition to the risks of acquisition described above. at any particular time, our global operations may be affected by local changes in laws, regulations, and the political and economic environments, including inflation, recession, currency volatility, and competition. any of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial position, and results of operations.
declining economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
our operations and performance depend on economic conditions in the united states and other countries where we do business. deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and, therefore, could reduce purchases by our customers, which would negatively affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability. negative trends in the general economy, including interest rate fluctuations, financial market volatility or credit market disruptions, may also affect our customers' ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms and reduce discretionary spending on health products. reduced purchases by our customers or changes in payment terms could adversely affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our cash flow from operations. bankruptcies or similar events affecting our customers may cause us to incur bad debt expense at levels higher than historically experienced. declining economic conditions may also increase our costs. if the economic conditions in the united states or in the countries where we do business do not improve or deteriorate, our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected.
our stock price and our ability to access credit markets may be adversely affected by financial market volatility and disruption.
if the capital and credit markets experience significant disruption and volatility in the future, there can be no assurance that we will not experience downward movement in our stock price without regard to our financial condition or results of operations or an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access credit. although we believe that our operating cash flow and existing credit arrangements give us the ability to meet our financing needs, there can be no assurance that disruption and volatility will not increase our costs of borrowing, impair our liquidity, or adversely impact our business.
our revenue and results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, or other credit failure of a significant customer.
most of our customers buy pharmaceuticals and other products and services from us on credit. credit is made available to customers based upon our assessment and analysis of creditworthiness. although we often try to obtain a security interest in assets and other arrangements intended to protect our credit exposure, we generally are either subordinated to the position of the primary lenders to our customers or substantially unsecured. volatility of the capital and credit markets, general economic conditions, and regulatory changes, including changes in reimbursement, may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our customers. the bankruptcy, insolvency, or other credit failure of any customer that has a substantial amount owed to us could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenue and results of operations. as of september 30, 2017, our two largest trade receivable balances due from customers represented approximately 49% and 9% of accounts receivable, net.
our results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy, insolvency or other credit failure of a significant supplier.
our relationships with pharmaceutical suppliers, including generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, give rise to substantial amounts that are due to us from the suppliers, including amounts owed to us for returned goods or defective goods, chargebacks, and amounts due to us for services provided to the suppliers. volatility of the capital and credit markets, general economic conditions, and regulatory changes may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our suppliers. the bankruptcy, insolvency or other credit failure of any supplier at a time when the supplier has a substantial account payable balance due to us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

risks generally associated with our sophisticated information systems may adversely affect our business and results of operations.
our businesses rely on sophisticated information systems to obtain, rapidly process, analyze, and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers; to receive, process, and ship orders on a timely basis; to account for other product and service transactions with customers; to manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers; and to process payments to suppliers. certain of our businesses continue to make substantial investments in information systems, including, but not limited to, the new patient support technology ecosystem, fusion, at abcs's services business and the implementation of a new erp system at world courier, and third party service providers are also responsible for managing a significant portion of our information systems. to the extent our information systems are not successfully implemented or fail, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. our business and results of operations may also be adversely affected if a third party service provider does not perform satisfactorily, or if the information systems are interrupted or damaged by unforeseen events, including due to the actions of third parties.
information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks. a failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our third party service providers, as a result of cyber attacks or information security breaches could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information or personal data, damage our reputation, increase our costs and/or cause losses. as a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. although we believe that we have robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place, as cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.
risks generally associated with data privacy regulation and the international transfer of personal data.
we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy regulations both in the united states and beyond that regulate the collection, use and transfer of personal data, including particularly the transfer of personal data between or among countries. many of these foreign data privacy regulations (including the general data protection regulation, which becomes effective in the european union on may 25, 2018) are more stringent than those in the united states. we may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations. an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties. that or other circumstances related to our collection, use and transfer of personal data could cause a loss of reputation in the market and/or adversely affect our business and financial position.
our goodwill or intangible assets may become impaired, which would require us to record a significant charge to earnings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") require us to test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in our stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. in addition, we periodically review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates, the loss of a significant customer, or divestiture of a business or asset for below its carrying value. the testing required by gaap involves estimates and judgments by management. although we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate, any changes in key assumptions, including a failure to meet business plans or other unanticipated events and circumstances such as a rise in interest rates, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined. any such charge could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
natural disasters or other unexpected events may disrupt our operations, adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and may not be covered by insurance.
the occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, and other forms of severe hazards in the united states or in other countries in which we operate or are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. extreme weather, natural disasters, power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of distribution centers or outsourcing facilities, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products, delay in the delivery of products to our distribution centers, and/or
16
disruption of our ability to deliver products to customers. further, the long-term effects of climate change on general economic conditions and the pharmaceutical distribution industry in particular are unclear, and changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy and the regulatory and other costs associated with energy production and delivery may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our businesses. existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for the costs that may arise from such events, particularly if such events are catastrophic in nature or occur in combination. any long-term disruption in our ability to service our customers from one or more distribution centers or outsourcing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein.
we are one of the largest global pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution services companies, helping both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical and biotech manufacturers improve patient access to products and enhance patient care. we deliver innovative programs and services designed to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the pharmaceutical supply chain in both human and animal health. we are organized based upon the products and services we provide to our customers. our operations are comprised of the pharmaceutical distribution services reportable segment and other operating segments that are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosure, and, therefore, have been included in other for the purpose of our reportable segment presentation.
pharmaceutical distribution services segment effective september 30, 2017, we reorganized our operating structure resulting in the combination of the legacy amerisourcebergen drug corporation ("abdc") and amerisourcebergen specialty group ("absg") operating segments into a single operating segment, pharmaceutical distribution services. in addition, in connection with the completion of this reorganization, our non-title third party logistics business, which was included within the pharmaceutical distribution services reportable segment, was combined with the world courier operating segment in other, while the amerisourcebergen consulting services ("abcs") distribution business (previously included in other) is now included in the pharmaceutical distribution services reportable segment. we revised our previously-reported segment disclosures to reflect the aforementioned changes to our reporting structure. these changes did not have a material impact to our historical reportable segment operating results.
the pharmaceutical distribution services reportable segment distributes a comprehensive offering of brand-name, specialty brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter healthcare products, home healthcare supplies and equipment, outsourced compounded sterile preparations, and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers, including acute care hospitals and health systems, independent and chain retail pharmacies, mail order pharmacies, medical clinics, long-term care and alternate site pharmacies, and other customers. through a number of operating businesses, the pharmaceutical distribution services reportable segment provides pharmaceutical distribution (including plasma and other blood products, injectible pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and other specialty pharmaceutical products) and additional services to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, especially oncology, and to other healthcare providers, including hospitals and dialysis clinics. additionally, the pharmaceutical distribution services reportable segment provides data analytics, outcomes research, and additional services for biotechnology and pharmaceutical manufacturers. the pharmaceutical distribution services reportable segment also provides pharmacy management, staffing and additional consulting services, and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers. additionally, it delivers packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers.
other other consists of operating segments that focus on global commercialization services and animal health and includes abcs, world courier, and mwi animal health ("mwi").
abcs, through a number of operating businesses, provides a full suite of integrated manufacturer services that range from clinical trial support to product post-approval and commercialization support. world courier, which operates in over 50 countries, is a leading global specialty transportation and logistics provider for the biopharmaceutical industry. mwi is a leading animal health distribution company in the united states and in the united kingdom. mwi sells pharmaceuticals, vaccines, parasiticides, diagnostics, micro feed ingredients, and various other products to customers in both the companion animal and production animal markets. additionally, mwi offers demand-creating sales force services to manufacturers.

executive summary this executive summary provides highlights from the results of operations that follow:
•   revenue increased 4.3% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the revenue growth of our pharmaceutical distribution services segment;
•   total gross profit increased 6.4% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the reduction of last-in, first-out ("lifo") expense, which was a credit of $157.8 million in the current fiscal year, in comparison to an expense of $200.2 million in the prior fiscal year and an increase in gross profit in other, offset in part by a decrease in gains from antitrust litigation settlements of $132.4 million and a decrease in gross profit in pharmaceutical distribution services. the lifo credit in the current fiscal year was primarily driven by lower brand inflation and greater generic deflation for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 in comparison to the prior fiscal year;
•   distribution, selling, and administrative expenses increased 1.8% from the prior fiscal year and as a percentage of revenue was 1.39% in the current fiscal year; a 3 basis point decline compared to the prior fiscal year. the decrease in expense as a percentage of revenue in comparison to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to initiatives taken in second half of the fiscal 2016 to improve operating efficiency across many of our businesses and certain administrative functions;
•   total operating expenses increased $738.8 million from the prior fiscal year, primarily due to litigation settlements and accruals of $914.4 million recognized during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017. the increase in litigation costs was offset in part by a decrease in warrants expense of $140.3 million and a $47.6 million pension settlement charge, both of which were recognized during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016; and
•   our effective tax rates were 60.3% and (2.7)% in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 was negatively impacted by legal settlements and accrual charges that we currently estimate to be non-deductible (see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements), offset in part by certain discrete items, the growth of our international businesses in switzerland and ireland that have significantly lower income tax rates, and the benefit from stock option exercises and restricted stock vesting. prior to the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017, tax benefits resulting from share-based compensation were recorded as adjustments to additional paid-in capital within stockholders' equity (see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements). our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016 primarily benefited from the receipt of an internal revenue service ("irs") private letter ruling that entitled us to an income tax deduction equal to the fair value of the warrants on the dates of exercise.

revenue increased by 4.3% from the prior fiscal year. see discussions below under "pharmaceutical distribution services segment" and "other" for commentary regarding our revenue growth.
based on our recently announced plan to acquire h.d. smith (see note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements), we currently expect our revenue in fiscal 2018 to increase between 8% and 11%. our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends, including drug utilization, the introduction of new innovative brand therapies (including biosimilars), the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers and the rate of conversion from brand products to those generic drugs, price increases and price deflation, general economic conditions in the united states, competition within the industry, customer consolidation, changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices, increased downward pressure on government and other third party reimbursement rates to our customers, and changes in federal government rules and regulations.
pharmaceutical distribution services segment the pharmaceutical distribution services segment grew its revenue by 4.1% from the prior fiscal year. intrasegment revenue between legacy abdc and legacy absg has been eliminated in the presentation of total pharmaceutical distribution services revenue. intrasegment revenues primarily consisted of legacy absg sales directly to legacy abdc customer sites or legacy absg sales to legacy abdc facilities. intrasegment revenues were $9.5 billion and $7.6 billion in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
legacy abdc's revenue of $124.6 billion increased 4.0% from the prior fiscal year (before intrasegment eliminations). the increase in revenue was primarily due to the growth of some of its largest customers and due to overall market growth within the retail customer segment, offset in part by a decline in sales of products that treat hepatitis c.
legacy absg's revenue of $31.5 billion increased 10.5% from the prior fiscal year (before intrasegment eliminations). the increase in revenue was primarily due to strong overall performance, especially in the sale of oncology products, and increased sales in our third party logistics business.
a number of our contracts with customers, including gpos, are typically subject to expiration each year. we may lose a significant customer if any existing contract with such customer expires without being extended, renewed, or replaced. during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017, no significant contracts expired without being renewed. over the next twelve months, there are no significant contracts scheduled to expire. additionally, from time to time, other significant contracts may be renewed prior to their expiration dates. if those contracts are renewed at less favorable terms, they may also negatively impact our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows.
other revenue in other increased 10.4% from the prior fiscal year, primarily due to increased revenue from mwi due to strong growth in its companion animal business and abcs due to its growth in manufacturer service programs. abcs service program revenue growth can be significantly impacted by manufacturer product growth and launches.

gross profit increased 6.4%, or $273.4 million, from the prior fiscal year. the increase in gross profit from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in lifo expense of $358.0 million and an increase in gross profit in other, offset in part by a decrease in gains from antitrust litigation settlements of $132.4 million and a decrease in gross profit in pharmaceutical distribution services. the lifo credit in the current fiscal year was primarily driven by lower brand inflation and greater generic deflation for fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 in comparison to the prior fiscal year.
our costs of goods sold includes a lifo provision that is affected by expected changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences, many of which are difficult to predict. changes to any of the above factors may have a material impact to our annual lifo provision.
pharmaceutical distribution services gross profit decreased 1.5%, or $50.0 million, from the prior fiscal year. gross profit in the current fiscal year was adversely impacted primarily by the prior year kaiser contract renewal effective july 1, 2016 at less favorable terms, a prior year gpo customer contract renewal effective april 1, 2016 at less favorable terms, lower price appreciation, and a lower contribution from pharmedium as it shipped fewer units while we increased our investment in quality control and quality assurance systems to enhance product quality and patient safety and to meet all of pharmedium's commitments to the u.s. food and drug administration ("fda") pursuant to the new federal requirements for outsourcing facilities, all of which was offset in part by an increase in revenue. as a percentage of revenue, pharmaceutical distribution services gross profit margin of 2.16% in the current fiscal year decreased 12 basis points from the prior fiscal year. the decrease from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the above-mentioned contract renewals, lower price appreciation, and increased sales to some of our larger customers that typically have a lower gross profit margin.
gross profit in other increased 8.9%, or $98.2 million, from the prior fiscal year. the increase was primarily due to revenue growth of abcs and mwi. as a percentage of revenue, gross profit margin in other of 20.96% in the current fiscal year decreased from 21.25% in the prior fiscal year.
we recognized gains from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers of $1.4 million and $133.8 million during the fiscal years ended september 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold (see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements).

distribution, selling, and administrative expenses increased 1.8%, or $37.5 million from the prior fiscal year and as a percentage of revenue, was 1.39% in the current fiscal year; a 3 basis point decline compared to the prior fiscal year. the decrease in expense as a percentage of revenue in comparison to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to initiatives taken in the second half of fiscal 2016 to improve operating efficiency across many of our businesses and certain administrative functions.
depreciation expense increased 11.7% from the prior fiscal year due to an increase in the amount of property and equipment placed into service relating to our distribution infrastructure and various technology assets. amortization expense increased 5.3%
27
from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets originating from our november 6, 2015 acquisition of pharmedium.
there was no warrants expense in the current fiscal year as the warrants were exercised in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016. warrants expense in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016 was $140.3 million.
employee severance, litigation, and other for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 included $38.1 million of costs related to employee severance and other costs, $914.4 million for litigation settlements and accruals (see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details), and $6.8 million of deal-related transaction costs. during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017, we began to reorganize to further align our organization to our customers' needs in a more seamless and unified way, while supporting corporate strategy and accelerating growth, and as a result, numerous positions were eliminated. employee severance, litigation, and other for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016 included $53.5 million of employee severance and other costs, $19.2 million of deal-related transaction costs (primarily related to professional fees with respect to the pharmedium acquisition), a $17.1 million charge related to the transfer of surplus assets from our settled salaried defined benefit pension plan to our defined contribution 401(k) plan, and $13.0 million of costs related to customer contract extensions (primarily related to the settlement of certain disputed items). during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016, we reorganized certain of our business units and corporate functions to improve operating efficiency, and as a result, numerous positions were eliminated.

pharmaceutical distribution services operating income decreased 3.5%, or $59.1 million, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the decrease in gross profit. as a percentage of revenue, pharmaceutical distribution services operating income margin of 1.11% decreased 9 basis points from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the prior year contract renewals at less favorable terms, lower price appreciation, and increased sales to some of our larger customers that typically have lower gross profit margin, offset in part by our initiatives to improve operating efficiency.
operating income in other increased 14.1%, or $46.1 million, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the gross profit increases of abcs and mwi, offset in part by an increase in operating expenses.

our interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in net borrowings, interest rates, amendments to our current borrowing facilities, and strategic decisions to deploy our invested cash.
our effective tax rates were 60.3% and (2.7)% in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 was negatively impacted by legal settlements and accrual charges that we currently estimate to be non-deductible (see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements), offset in part by certain discrete items, the growth of our international businesses in switzerland and ireland that have significantly lower income tax rates, and the benefit from stock option exercises and restricted stock vesting. prior to the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017, tax benefits resulting from share-based compensation were recorded as adjustments to additional paid-in capital within stockholders' equity. our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016 primarily benefited from the receipt of an irs private letter ruling that entitled us to an income tax deduction equal to the fair value of the warrants on the dates of exercise.
net income was $364.5 million and $1,427.9 million in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2017 and 2016.

revenue increased by 8.0% from the prior fiscal year. see discussions below under "pharmaceutical distribution services" and "other" for commentary regarding our revenue growth.
pharmaceutical distribution services segment the pharmaceutical distribution services segment grew its revenue by 7.0% from the prior fiscal year. intrasegment revenues between legacy abdc and legacy absg have been eliminated in the presentation of total pharmaceutical distribution services revenue. intrasegment revenues primarily consisted of legacy absg sales directly to legacy abdc customer sites or legacy absg sales to legacy abdc facilities. intrasegment revenues were $7.6 billion and $6.4 billion in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
legacy abdc's revenue of $119.8 billion increased 5.6% from the prior fiscal year (before intrasegment eliminations). the increase in legacy abdc's revenue was primarily due to overall market growth, including sales to wba. revenue in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016 was negatively impacted by lower sales of products that treat hepatitis c.
legacy absg's revenue of $28.5 billion increased 17.1% from the prior fiscal year (before intrasegment eliminations). the increase in legacy absg's revenue was due to the continued growth in our oncology business (including an increase in sales to community oncologists), increased sales in our third party logistics business, and increases in our blood products, vaccine, and physician office distribution businesses.

during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016, no significant contracts expired. however, a significant contract with a gpo was renewed, effective april 1, 2016, and our agreement with kaiser was renewed for a five-year term commencing on july 1, 2016, both at less favorable terms than the previous contracts.
other revenue in other increased 45.2% from the prior fiscal year, primarily due to incremental revenue contribution from mwi, which was acquired in february 2015.

gross profit increased 21.1%, or $743.3 million, from the prior fiscal year. the increase was due to the $342.6 million decrease in lifo expense from the prior fiscal year, the increase in the gross profit of other, the increase in gross profit of pharmaceutical distribution services, and the $68.3 million increase in gains from antitrust litigation settlements from the prior fiscal year. the decrease in lifo expense was primarily due to lower brand inflation and higher generic drug deflation.
pharmaceutical distribution services gross profit increased 3.0%, or $95.5 million, from the prior fiscal year. the increase was due to the contribution from our fiscal 2016 pharmedium acquisition and the growth of legacy absg's revenue. gross profit growth in the current fiscal year benefited from the incremental income from legacy abdc's participation in the wba generic purchasing services arrangement and was adversely impacted by lower generic price appreciation, an increase in generic price deflation, and contract renewals with the the department of defense, a significant gpo customer, and kaiser, all at less favorable terms. as a percentage of revenue, pharmaceutical distribution services gross profit margin of 2.28% in the current fiscal year decreased 9 basis points from the prior fiscal year. the decrease from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to lower generic price appreciation, an increase in generic price deflation, contract renewals at less favorable terms, and increased sales to our larger customers that typically have a lower gross profit margin.
gross profit in other increased 27.3%, or $237.0 million, from the prior fiscal year. the increase was primarily due to the contribution of our february 2015 acquisition of mwi, and, to a lesser extent, the increase in legacy abcs's revenue. as a percentage of revenue, gross profit margin in other of 21.25% in the current fiscal year decreased from 24.23% in the prior fiscal year. the decrease from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the addition of mwi, which has a lower gross profit margin in comparison to other businesses within other.
we recognized gains from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers of $133.8 million and $65.5 million during the fiscal years ended september 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

distribution, selling, and administrative expenses increased 9.6%, or $183.4 million from the prior fiscal year primarily due to our february 2015 acquisition of mwi, and to a lesser extent, our november 2015 acquisition of pharmedium. as a percentage of revenue, distribution, selling, and administrative expenses were 1.42% in the current fiscal year, and represents an
30
increase of 2 basis points compared to the prior fiscal year. the increase of 2 basis points was primarily due to the addition of mwi, which has higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in comparison to the pharmaceutical distribution services segment, offset in part by an initiative to improve operating efficiency across many of our businesses and certain administrative functions.
depreciation expense increased 10.5% from the prior fiscal year due to an increase in the amount of property and equipment placed into service. amortization expense increased 169.9% from prior fiscal year primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets originating from our mwi and pharmedium acquisitions.
warrants expense decreased significantly from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the decline in our stock price since september 30, 2015. the warrants were issued in march 2013 in connection with the agreements and arrangements that define our strategic relationship with wba. the warrants were exercised by wba in full in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016.
employee severance, litigation, and other for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016 included $53.5 million of employee severance and other costs, $19.2 million of deal-related transaction costs (primarily related to professional fees with respect to the pharmedium acquisition), a $17.1 million charge related to the transfer of surplus assets from our settled salaried defined benefit pension plan to our defined contribution 401(k) plan, and $13.0 million of costs related to customer contract extensions (primarily related to the settlement of certain disputed items). employee severance, litigation, and other for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2015 included $5.3 million of employee severance and other costs and $32.6 million of deal-related transaction costs (primarily related to professional fees with respect to the mwi acquisition).
we recorded a pension settlement charge of $47.6 million in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016 related to the final settlement of our salaried defined benefit plan (see note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements).

interest expense, net increased 28.3%, or $30.9 million, from the prior fiscal year due to an increase of $1.3 billion in average borrowings from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the february 2015 issuance of senior notes totaling $1.0 billion and the february 2015 and november 2015 variable-rate term loan borrowings to finance a portion of the mwi and pharmedium acquisitions, respectively. our average borrowing rate was lower during the current fiscal year primarily as a result of the recent variable-rate financings, which bear interest at lower rates.
our effective tax rates were (2.7%) and 151.4% in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016 primarily benefited from an irs private letter ruling that entitled us to an income tax benefit equal to the fair value of the warrants on the dates of exercise. our effective tax rate was also favorably impacted in fiscal 2016 by growth of our international businesses in switzerland and ireland that have significantly lower income tax rates.
net income was $1,427.9 million in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016. net loss was $138.2 million in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2015.
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those policies which involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management's judgment. actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates. below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. for a complete list of significant accounting policies, see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
allowance for doubtful accounts and reserve for customer sales returns trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and a reserve for customer sales returns. our customer sales return policy generally allows customers to return products only if the products can be resold at full value or returned to suppliers for full credit. we record an accrual for estimated customer sales returns at the time of sale to the customer based upon historical customer return trends.
in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, we consider a combination of factors, such as the aging of trade receivables, industry trends, and our customers' financial strength, credit standing, and payment and default history. changes in the aforementioned factors, among others, may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts. the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables. each of our business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based upon historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise. we write off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote. each business unit performs formal, documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly, and our largest business units perform such reviews monthly. there were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended september 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015, and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods. the bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts, net of write-offs, recoveries, and other adjustments. schedule ii of this form 10-k sets forth a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts and reserve for customer sales returns.
bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $8.9 million, $13.1 million, and $8.1 million, respectively. an increase or decrease of 0.1% in the 2017 allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately $10.4 million. the allowance for doubtful accounts was $66.6 million and $69.8 million as of september 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
32
business combinations the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business are recorded at fair value, with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. we engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. such valuations require management to make significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable. these estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include, but are not limited to: discount rates and future expected cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships, trade names, existing technology, and other intangible assets. unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions or estimates.
equity investments we use the equity method of accounting for our investments in entities in which we have significant influence; generally, this represents an ownership interest of between 20% and 50%. unrealized losses that are determined to be other-than-temporary impairment losses are recorded as a component of earnings in the period in which that determination is made. we recorded an impairment charge of $30.6 million in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2015 related to our minority ownership interest in a pharmaceutical wholesaler in brazil. the impairment charge was based upon our determination that the decline in the pharmaceutical wholesaler's stock price from the date on which the investment was made to september 30, 2015 was other-than-temporary. there were no impairment charges on equity investments in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2017 or 2016.
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, certain trademarks and trade names, are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually. for the purpose of these impairment tests, we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets, respectively. we elected to bypass performing the qualitative assessment and, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, went directly to performing our annual quantitative assessments of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for the current year. we also completed a qualitative assessment immediately after our reorganization in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. we may elect to perform the qualitative annual assessment in future periods.
the goodwill impairment test requires us to compare the carrying value of the reporting unit's net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. if the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is required, and no impairment loss is recognized. if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the difference between the carrying value and the fair value is recorded as an impairment loss, the amount of which not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
we identify our reporting units based upon our management reporting structure, and our reporting units are the same as our operating segments. generally, goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides.
we utilize an income-based approach to value our reporting units. the income-based approach relies on a discounted cash flow analysis, which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate, to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. we believe that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of our reporting units in a sale transaction. the annual goodwill impairment test requires us to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins, depreciation, amortization, capital expenditures, and working capital requirements, which are based upon our long-range plan. the discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both debt and equity, including a risk premium. while we use the best available information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows and/or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances. while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions, our overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged.
the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (certain trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. we estimate the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty method. we believe the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets. the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use.
33
we completed our required annual impairment tests relating to goodwill and other intangible assets in the fourth quarter of the fiscal years ended september 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015, and determined that there were no impairments.
income taxes our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions reflect management's assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements. deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes.
we have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually. after application of the valuation allowances described above, we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other deferred income tax assets described above.
we prepare and file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based upon these judgments and interpretations. in the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation, and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions' tax court systems. significant judgment is exercised in applying complex tax laws and regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based upon the technical merits of the position.
we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits recognized in our financial statements for uncertain tax positions are appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances. however, others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued.
the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year. if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change, an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1% on income before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by $9.2 million in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017.
loss contingencies in the ordinary course of business, we become involved in lawsuits, administrative proceedings, government subpoenas, government investigations, and other disputes, including antitrust, commercial, environmental, product liability, intellectual property, regulatory, employment discrimination, and other matters. significant damages or penalties may be sought in some matters, and some matters may require years to resolve. we record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. we also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of amounts accrued. if a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material, we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements. we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made.
merchandise inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. cost for approximately 80% of our inventories as of september 30, 2017 and 2016 has been determined using the lifo method. if we had used the first-in, first-out method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement cost, inventories would have been approximately $1,467.0 million and $1,624.8 million higher than the amounts reported as of september 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. we recorded a lifo credit of $157.8 million in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 and lifo expense of $200.2 million and $542.8 million in fiscal years ended september 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the annual lifo provision is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences, many of which are difficult to predict. changes to any of the above factors can have a material impact to our annual lifo provision.

share-based compensation we account for the compensation cost of all share-based payments at fair value. we utilize a binomial option pricing model to determine the fair value of share-based compensation expense, which involves the use of several assumptions, including expected term of the option, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, and forfeiture rate. the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based upon historical experience. expected volatility is based upon historical volatility of our common stock as well as other factors, such as implied volatility. the fair value of performance stock units is determined by the grant date market price of our common stock and the compensation expense associated with the non-vested performance stock units is dependent on our periodic assessment of the probability of financial targets being achieved and our estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately be issued.
supplier reserves we establish reserves against amounts due from our suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them. these reserve estimates are established based upon the judgment of management after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs, and any other pertinent information available to us. we evaluate the amounts due from our suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based upon changes in factual circumstances. an increase or decrease of 0.1% in the 2017 supplier reserve balances as a percentage of trade payables would result in an increase or decrease in cost of goods sold by approximately $25.4 million. the ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim may be different from our estimate.

our operating results have generated cash flows, which, together with availability under our debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers, have provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, repayment of debt, the payment of interest on outstanding debt, dividends, and repurchases of shares of our common stock.
our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital, fund the repayment of debt, fund the payment of interest on debt, fund repurchases of our common stock, fund the payment of dividends, finance acquisitions, and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities. future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund our ongoing cash requirements.
as of september 30, 2017 and 2016, our cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were $995.7 million and $582.9 million, respectively, and are generally based in u.s. dollar denominated holdings. we expect that our cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries may continue to grow. amounts held outside of the united states are generally utilized
35
to support non-u.s. liquidity needs, including future acquisitions of non-u.s. entities, although a portion of these amounts may from time to time be subject to short-term intercompany loans to u.s. subsidiaries. amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to u.s. income taxation on repatriation to the united states. we do not have any plans to repatriate these amounts to the united states, as our foreign subsidiaries intend to indefinitely reinvest this cash in foreign investments or foreign operations.
we have increased seasonal needs related to our inventory build during the december and march quarters that, depending on our cash balance, can require the use of our credit facilities to fund short-term capital needs. our cash balance in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2017 and 2016 needed to be supplemented by intra-period credit facility borrowings to cover short-term working capital needs. our cash balance in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016 also needed to be supplemented by intra-period credit facility borrowings to cover a portion of the purchase price of pharmedium in advance of securing long-term financing. the largest amount of intra-period borrowings under our revolving and securitization credit facilities that was outstanding at any one time during the fiscal years ended september 30, 2017 and 2016 was $626.1 million and $1,018.2 million, respectively. we had $9,324.7 million, $8,333.7 million, and $111.1 million of cumulative intra-period borrowings that were repaid under our credit facilities during the fiscal years ended september 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. additionally, in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016, we borrowed $500.0 million under our receivables securitization facility that we used to finance principal payments that we elected to make on the november 2015 term loan (see below).
in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017, we repaid the $600 million of 1.15% senior notes that became due, and we repaid $150 million of amounts outstanding under our term loans.
we have a $1.4 billion multi-currency senior unsecured revolving credit facility ("multi-currency revolving credit facility"), which expires in november 2021, with a syndicate of lenders. interest on borrowings under the multi-currency revolving credit facility accrues at specified rates based upon our debt rating and ranges from 70 basis points to 110 basis points over cdor/libor/euribor/bankers acceptance stamping fee, as applicable (91 basis points over cdor/libor/euribor/bankers acceptance stamping fee as of september 30, 2017) and from 0 basis points to 10 basis points over the alternate base rate and canadian prime rate, as applicable. we pay facility fees to maintain the availability under the multi-currency revolving credit facility at specified rates based upon our debt rating, ranging from 5 basis points to 15 basis points, annually, of the total commitment (9 basis points as of september 30, 2017). we may choose to repay or reduce our commitments under the multi-currency revolving credit facility at any time. the multi-currency revolving credit facility contains covenants, including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test, as well as others that impose limitations on, among other things, indebtedness of subsidiaries and asset sales, with which we were compliant as of september 30, 2017.
we have a commercial paper program whereby we may from time to time issue short-term promissory notes in an aggregate amount of up to $1.4 billion at any one time. amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time. the maturities on the notes will vary, but may not exceed 365 days from the date of issuance. the notes will bear interest, if interest bearing, or will be sold at a discount from their face amounts. the commercial paper program does not increase our borrowing capacity as it is fully backed by our multi-currency revolving credit facility. there were no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program as of september 30, 2017 and 2016.
we have a $1,450 million receivables securitization facility ("receivables securitization facility"), which expires in november 2019. in fiscal 2016, we utilized the capacity to borrow $500 million on the receivables securitization facility to finance $500 million of principal payments that we elected to make on the november 2015 term loan (defined below), as the receivables securitization facility bears interest at a lower rate. we have available to us an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the receivables securitization facility may be increased by up to $250 million, subject to lender approval, for seasonal needs during the december and march quarters. interest rates are based upon prevailing market rates for short-term commercial paper or libor plus a program fee. we pay a customary unused fee at prevailing market rates, annually, to maintain the availability under the receivables securitization facility. the receivables securitization facility contains similar covenants to the multi-currency revolving credit facility, with which we were compliant as of september 30, 2017.
in connection with the receivables securitization facility, amerisourcebergen drug corporation sells on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to amerisource receivables financial corporation, a wholly-owned special purpose entity, which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to financial institutions and commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions. amerisourcebergen drug corporation is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the receivables securitization facility. as sold receivables are collected, additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility. we use the facility as a financing vehicle because it generally offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources.
we have an uncommitted, unsecured line of credit available to us pursuant to a revolving credit note ("revolving credit note"). the revolving credit note provides us with the ability to request short-term unsecured revolving credit loans from time to time in a principal amount not to exceed $75 million. the revolving credit note may be decreased or terminated by the bank
36
or us at any time without prior notice. we also have a £30 million uncommitted u.k. overdraft facility ("overdraft facility"), which expires in february 2021, to fund short-term, normal trading cycle fluctuations related to our mwi business.
in february 2015, we entered into a $1.0 billion variable-rate term loan ("february 2015 term loan"), which matures in 2020. through september 30, 2017, we elected to make principal payments, prior to the scheduled repayment dates, of $775 million on the february 2015 term loan, and as a result, our next required principal payment is due upon maturity. the february 2015 term loan bears interest at a rate equal either to a base rate plus a margin, or libor, plus a margin. the margin is based upon our public debt ratings and ranges from 75 basis points to 125 basis points over libor (100 basis points as of september 30, 2017) and 0 to 25 basis points over a base rate. the february 2015 term loan contains similar covenants to the multi-currency revolving credit facility, with which we were compliant as of september 30, 2017. we used the proceeds from the february 2015 term loan to finance a portion of the cash consideration paid in connection with the acquisition of mwi.
in november 2015, we entered into a $1.0 billion variable-rate term loan ("november 2015 term loan"), which matures in 2020. through september 30, 2017, we made a scheduled principal payment, as well as other principal payments prior to the scheduled repayment dates totaling $675 million on the november 2015 term loan, and as a result, our next required principal payment is due upon maturity. the november 2015 term loan bears interest at a rate equal either to a base rate, plus a margin, or libor, plus a margin. the margin is based upon our public debt ratings and ranges from 75 basis points to 125 basis points over libor (100 basis points as of september 30, 2017) and 0 basis points to 25 basis points over a base rate. the november 2015 term loan contains similar covenants to the multi-currency revolving credit facility, with which we are compliant as of september 30, 2017. we used the proceeds from the november 2015 term loan to finance a portion of the cash consideration paid in connection with the acquisition of pharmedium.
we have $400 million of 4.875% senior notes due november 15, 2019, $500 million of 3.50% senior notes due november 15, 2021, $500 million of 3.40% senior notes due may 15, 2024, $500 million of 3.25% senior notes due march 1, 2025, and $500 million of 4.25% senior notes due march 1, 2045 (collectively, the "notes"). interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears.
in august 2013, our board of directors authorized a program allowing us to purchase up to $750 million in shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions. during the fiscal years ended september 30, 2014 and 2015, we purchased $174.7 million and $300.8 million, respectively, under this share repurchase program. during the six months ended march 31, 2016, we purchased $100.0 million of our common stock under this program. in may 2016, our board of directors authorized a new share purchase program that, together with availability remaining under the existing august 2013 share repurchase program, permitted us to purchase up to $750 million in shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions. in september 2016, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase ("asr") transaction with a financial institution and paid $400 million for shares of our common stock. the initial payment of $400 million funded stock purchases of $380.0 million and a share holdback of $20.0 million. the asr transaction was settled in november 2016, at which time the financial institution delivered additional shares to us. the number of shares ultimately received was based upon the volume-weighted average price of our common stock during the term of the asr. we applied the $400 million asr to the may 2016 share repurchase program. in addition to the asr, during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016, we purchased $231.2 million of our common stock under the may 2016 program. during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017, we purchased $118.8 million of our common stock to complete our authorization under this program.
in november 2016, our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program allowing us to purchase up to $1.0 billion in shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions. during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017, we purchased $211.1 million of our common stock under this program. as of september 30, 2017, we had $788.9 million of availability remaining under this program.
in march 2013, we and wba entered into various agreements and arrangements pursuant to which subsidiaries of wba were granted the right to purchase a minority equity position in us, beginning with the right, but not the obligation, to purchase up to 19,859,795 shares of our common stock in open market transactions (approximately 7% of our common stock on a fully diluted basis as of the date of issuance of the warrants described below, assuming their exercise in full). in connection with these arrangements, wholly-owned subsidiaries of wba were issued (a) warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 22,696,912 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share, exercisable during a six-month period beginning in march 2016 (the "2016 warrants"), and (b) warrants to purchase up to 22,696,912 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $52.50 per share, exercisable during a six-month period beginning in march 2017 (the "2017 warrants" and together with the 2016 warrants, the "warrants").
in june 2013, we commenced a hedging strategy by entering into a contract with a financial institution pursuant to which we executed a series of issuer capped call transactions ("capped calls"). the capped calls gave us the right to buy shares of our common stock subject to the warrants at specified prices at maturity. this hedge transaction was completed in january 2014 and included the purchase of capped calls on a total of 27.2 million shares of our common stock for a total premium of $368.7 million.
37
subsequently, we paid a premium of $100.0 million in january 2015 to increase the cap price on certain of the capped calls subject to the 2016 warrants. the capped calls allowed us to acquire shares of our common stock at strike prices of $51.50 and $52.50 and have expiration dates ranging from february 2016 through october 2017. the capped calls permitted net share settlement, which is limited by caps on the market price of our common stock. we accounted for the capped calls as equity contracts and therefore the above premiums were recorded as a reduction to paid-in capital.
in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2014 and 2015, we purchased $1,774.1 million of our common stock under special share repurchase programs to further mitigate the potentially dilutive effect of the warrants and supplement our previously executed warrant hedging strategy.
in march 2015, we further supplemented our hedging strategy by entering into a contract with a financial institution pursuant to which we executed a series of issuer call options ("call options"). the call options gave us the right to buy shares of our common stock subject to the warrants at specified prices between april 2015 and october 2015. in total, we purchased call options on six million shares of our common stock for a total premium of $80.0 million. we accounted for the call options as equity contracts and therefore, the above premium was recorded as a reduction to paid-in capital.
in september 2015, our board of directors authorized a special share repurchase program allowing us to purchase up to $2.4 billion in shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions. during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016, we purchased $1,535.1 million of our common stock under (all under the call options and capped calls) this program. we had $740.9 million of availability remaining under this special share repurchase program as of september 30, 2016. however, this availability will not be utilized as the earnings per share dilutive effect of the warrants was fully mitigated by us concurrent with the august 2016 exercise of the 2017 warrants (see below).
in march 2016, the 2016 warrants were exercised for $1,168.9 million in cash. in august 2016, the 2017 warrants were amended so that they became exercisable in whole or in part during the six-month period beginning in august 2016 at an exercise price of $52.50. in august 2016, the 2017 warrants were exercised by wba for $1,191.6 million in cash.
the earnings per share dilutive effect of the warrants was fully mitigated by our hedging a portion of our obligation to deliver common stock with a financial institution and repurchasing additional shares of our common stock under the special share repurchase programs, as described above, for our own account over time.
the following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on our debt, minimum rental payments on our noncancelable operating leases and financing obligations, and minimum payments on our other commitments as of september 30, 2017:

1 represents the portion of future minimum lease payments relating to facility leases where we were determined to be the accounting owner (see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements). these payments are recognized as reductions to the financing obligation and as interest expense and exclude the future non-cash termination of the financing obligation.
we outsource to ibm global services a significant portion of our data center operations. the remaining commitment under our arrangement, which expires in january 2021, is approximately $67.7 million as of september 30, 2017, of which $35.0 million represents our commitment in fiscal 2018, and is included in "other commitments" in the above table.
our liability for uncertain tax positions was $338.4 million (including interest and penalties) as of september 30, 2017. this liability represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. since the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table.
during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017, our operating activities provided $1,504.1 million of cash in comparison to cash provided of $3,178.5 million in the prior fiscal year. cash provided by operations in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 was principally the result of an increase in accounts payable of $1,473.4 million, an increase in accrued expenses of $661.2 million, non-cash items of $672.5 million, and net income of $364.5 million, offset in part by an increase in accounts receivable of $1,277.9 million and an increase in merchandise inventories of $431.5 million. the non-cash items were comprised primarily
38
of $262.4 million of depreciation expense, $169.9 million of amortization expense, a lifo credit of $157.8 million, and $319.1 million of deferred income tax expense. the increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by the increase in merchandise inventories and the timing of scheduled payments to our suppliers. we increased our merchandise inventories as of september 30, 2017 to support the increase in business volume. the increase in accrued expenses was primarily driven by a current year litigation accrual of $625.0 million (see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements). the increase in accounts receivable was the result of our revenue growth and a gradual change in payment terms with our largest customer that occurred between may 2016 and february 2017 as part of a contract amendment that, among other things, extended the term of our relationship with the customer.
deterioration in general economic conditions, among other factors, could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and, therefore, could reduce purchases by our customers. in addition, volatility in financial markets may also negatively impact our customers' ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms. reduced purchases by our customers or changes in the ability of our customers to remit payments to us could adversely affect our revenue growth, our profitability, and our cash flow from operations.
we use days sales outstanding, days inventory on hand, and days payable outstanding to evaluate our working capital performance. the below financial metrics are calculated based upon an annual average and can be impacted by the timing of cash receipts and disbursements, which can vary significantly depending upon the day of the week in which the month ends.
fiscal year ended september 30,
2017              2016              2015
days sales outstanding            23.8              21.6              20.0
days inventory on hand            30.1              30.0              29.5
days payable outstanding          57.4              56.9              51.9
the increase in days sales outstanding from the prior fiscal year was the result of a gradual change in payment terms with our largest customer that occurred between may 2016 and february 2017.
our cash flows from operating activities can vary significantly from period to period based upon fluctuations in our period end working capital. additionally, any changes to payment terms with a significant customer or manufacturer supplier could have a material impact to our cash flows from operations. operating cash flows during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2017 included $125.3 million of interest payments and $105.0 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. operating cash flows during the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016 included $123.5 million of interest payments and $17.5 million of income tax payments, net of refunds.

capital expenditures in the fiscal years ended september 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $466.4 million, $464.6 million, and $231.6 million, respectively. significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 included costs associated with expanding distribution capacity and technology initiatives, including costs related to enhancing and upgrading our enterprise resource planning systems ("erp"). significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 included costs associated with expanding distribution capacity, technology initiatives, including costs related to the development of track-and-trace technology, and the expansion of support facilities. significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2015 included technology initiatives, including costs related to the further development of our primary erp system, costs associated with building our national distribution center, and expansion of support facilities.

net cash used in financing activities in the fiscal year ended september 30, 2015 primarily included $1.0 billion of borrowings under our february 2015 term loan and $996.4 million of proceeds related to the february 2015 issuance of our 2025 notes and 2045 notes, offset in part by $1,859.1 million in purchases of our common stock and $180.0 million to purchase or amend capped calls and call options, to hedge the potential dilution associated with the warrants upon their exercise. we used the proceeds from these financing activities to fund a portion of our february 2015 acquisition of mwi.
our board of directors approved the following quarterly dividend increases:
dividend increases per share date                 new rate         old rate        % increase november 2014          $0.290           $0.235               23%
november 2015          $0.340           $0.290               17%
november 2016          $0.365           $0.340                7%
november 2017          $0.380           $0.365                4%
we anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. however, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, and other factors.
market risk we have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our debt. we manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. the amount of variable-rate debt fluctuates during the year based upon our working capital requirements. we had $1.1 billion of variable-rate debt outstanding as of september 30, 2017. we periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates. however, there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want and/or on terms acceptable to us. there were no such financial instruments in effect as of september 30, 2017.
we also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents.  we had $2,435.1 million in cash and cash equivalents as of september 30, 2017. the unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variable-rate debt. for every $100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variable-rate debt, a 10 basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by $0.1 million.
we have minimal exposure to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our non-u.s. operations. our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the euro, the u.k. pound sterling, the canadian dollar, and the brazilian real. revenue from our foreign operations is approximately one percent of our consolidated revenue. we may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates. we may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure, but not for speculative or trading purposes. as of september 30, 2017, we had one foreign currency denominated contract outstanding that hedges the foreign currency exchange risk of a c$27.6 million outstanding note.

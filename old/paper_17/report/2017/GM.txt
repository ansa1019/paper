item 1a. risk factors we have listed below (not necessarily in order of importance or probability of occurrence) the most significant risk factors applicable to us:
if we do not deliver new products, services and customer experiences in response to new participants in the automotive industry, our business could suffer.  we believe that the automotive industry will experience significant and continued change in the coming years. in addition to our traditional competitors, we must also be responsive to the entrance of non-traditional participants in the automotive industry. industry participants are seeking to disrupt the historic business model of the industry through the introduction of new technologies, new products or services, new business models or new methods of travel. it is strategically significant that we lead the technological disruption occurring in our industry. to successfully execute our long-term strategy, we must continue to develop new products and services, including products and services that are outside of our historically core business, such as autonomous and electric vehicles, data monetization and transportation as a service. the process of designing and developing new technology, products and services is complex, costly, and uncertain and requires extensive capital investment and the ability to retain and recruit talent. in some cases the technologies that we plan to employ are not yet commercially practical and depend on significant future technological advances by us and by our suppliers. there can be no assurance that advances in technology will occur in a timely or feasible way, or that others will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do or that we will acquire technologies on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage. if we do not accurately predict, prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations, market developments and changing customer needs, our sales, profitability and long-term competitiveness may be harmed.
our ability to maintain profitability is dependent upon our ability to timely fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers. we operate in a very competitive industry with market participants routinely introducing new and improved vehicle models designed to meet rapidly evolving consumer expectations. producing new and improved vehicle models competitively and preserving our reputation for designing, building and selling safe high quality cars and trucks is critical to our long-term profitability. successful launches of our new vehicles are critical to our short-term profitability.
it generally takes two years or more to design and develop a new vehicle, and a number of factors may lengthen that time period. because of this product development cycle and the various elements that may contribute to consumers' acceptance of new vehicle designs, including competitors' product introductions, technological innovations, fuel prices, general economic conditions and changes in quality, safety, reliability and styling demands and preferences, an initial product concept or design may not result in a vehicle that generates sales in sufficient quantities and at high enough prices to be profitable. our high proportion of fixed costs, both due to our significant investment in property, plant and equipment as well as other requirements of our collective bargaining agreements, which limit our flexibility to adjust personnel costs to changes in demands for our products, may further exacerbate the risks associated with incorrectly assessing demand for our vehicles.
our profitability is dependent upon the success of crossovers, suvs and full-size pick-up trucks. while we offer a balanced and complete portfolio of small, mid-size and large cars, crossovers, suvs and trucks, we generally recognize higher profit margins on our crossovers, suvs and trucks. our success is dependent upon our ability to sell higher margin vehicles in sufficient volumes. any shift in consumer preferences toward smaller, more fuel efficient vehicles, whether as a result of increases in the price of oil or any sustained shortage of oil, including as a result of global political instability or other reasons, could weaken the demand for our higher margin vehicles.
we must successfully address and reduce the costs associated with the manufacture and sale of electric vehicles. we anticipate that electric vehicle sales will become increasingly important to our business. the inability to reduce the costs associated with the manufacture and sale of electric vehicles may negatively impact our earnings and financial condition. in addition, we currently
10
general motors company and subsidiaries benefit from certain government and economic incentives supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicles. the benefits from these incentives could be reduced, eliminated or exhausted, which may negatively affect our ability to sell electric vehicles in sufficient quantities and at high enough prices to be profitable.
our business is highly dependent upon global automobile market sales volume, which can be volatile. because we have a high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, small changes in sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on our profitability. a number of economic and market conditions drive changes in vehicle sales, including real estate values, levels of unemployment, availability of affordable financing, fluctuations in the cost of fuel, consumer confidence, political unrest and global economic conditions. for discussion of economic and market trends, see the overview section of item 7. we cannot predict future economic and market conditions with certainty.
our significant business in china subjects us to unique operational, competitive and regulatory risks maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy. our business in china is subject to aggressive competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous domestic manufacturers. as the size of the chinese market continues to increase we anticipate that additional competitors, both international and domestic, will seek to enter the chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase their market share. increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins and challenges to gain or hold market share.
in addition to increased competition, chinese regulators have announced aggressive policy initiatives and quotas for the sale of electric vehicles.
certain risks and uncertainties of doing business in china are solely within the control of the chinese government, and chinese law regulates the scope of our foreign investments and business conducted within china. in order to maintain access to the chinese market, we may be required to comply with significant technical and other regulatory requirements that are unique to the chinese market, at times with challenging lead-time to implement such requirements. these actions may increase the cost of doing business in china and reduce our profitability.
a significant amount of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit. many of our operations, primarily in china, are carried out by joint ventures. in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint venture. joint ventures are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions that must further take into consideration our partners' interests. in joint ventures we are required to foster our relationships with our co-owners as well as promote the overall success of the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes, relationships deteriorate or strategic objectives diverge, our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected. the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, therefore we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures. in addition, because we share ownership and management with one or more parties, we may have limited control over the actions of a joint venture, particularly when we own a minority interest. as a result, we may be unable to prevent misconduct or other violations of applicable laws by a joint venture. moreover, a joint venture may not follow the same requirements regarding compliance, internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow. to the extent another party makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control issues arise within the joint venture, we may have to take responsive or other action or we may be subject to penalties, fines or other related actions for these activities.
the international scale and footprint of our operations exposes us to additional risks. we manufacture, sell and service products globally and rely upon a global supply chain to deliver the raw materials, components, systems and parts that we need to manufacture our products. our global operations subject us to extensive domestic and foreign legal and regulatory requirements, and a variety of other political, economic and regulatory risks including: changes in government leadership; changes in laws or regulations impacting our overall business model or restricting our ability to manufacture, purchase or sell products, and political pressures to change any aspect of our business model or practices and source raw materials, components, systems and parts on competitive terms in a manner consistent with our current practice; changes in tax laws; economic tensions between governments and changes in international trade policies, including restrictions on the repatriation of dividends, especially between the u.s. and china, more detailed inspections, new or higher tariffs, for example, on products imported from mexico into the u.s.; new barriers to entry or domestic preference procurement requirements, changes to or withdrawals from free trade agreements (for example, the north american free trade agreement or nafta), or preferences of foreign nationals for domestically manufactured products; changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; economic downturns in foreign countries or geographic regions where we have significant operations, significant changes in conditions in the countries in which we operate with the effect of
11
general motors company and subsidiaries competition from new market entrants; differing local product preferences and product requirements, including fuel economy, vehicle emissions and safety; impact of compliance with u.s. and other foreign countries' export controls and economic sanctions; liabilities resulting from u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to the foreign corrupt practices act and certain other anti-corruption laws; differing labor regulations and union relationships; and difficulties in obtaining financing in foreign countries for local operations.
any significant disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could disrupt our production schedule. we assemble vehicles at various facilities around the world. these facilities are typically designed to produce particular models for particular geographic markets. no single facility is designed to manufacture our full range of vehicles. in some cases certain facilities produce products, systems, components and parts that disproportionately contribute a greater degree to our profitability than others. should these or other facilities become unavailable either temporarily or permanently for any number of reasons, including labor disruptions, the inability to manufacture there may result in harm to our reputation, increased costs, lower revenues and the loss of customers. we may not be able to easily shift production to other facilities or to make up for lost production. any new facility needed to replace an inoperable manufacturing facility would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirements, need to satisfy our specialized manufacturing requirements and require specialized equipment. even though we carry business interruption insurance policies, we may suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available or any losses which may be excluded under our insurance policies.
any disruption in our suppliers' operations could disrupt our production schedule. our automotive operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the systems, components, raw materials and parts that we need to manufacture our products. our use of "just-in-time" manufacturing processes allows us to maintain minimal inventory quantities of systems, components, raw materials and parts. as a result our ability to maintain production is dependent upon our suppliers delivering sufficient quantities of systems, components, raw materials and parts on time to meet our production schedules. in some instances we purchase systems, components, raw materials and parts that ultimately derive from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. disputes, financial difficulties or solvency problems with our suppliers, including takata corporation (takata), which may be exacerbated by the cost of remediating quality issues with these items, could lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruptions for us which could, in turn, disrupt our operations, including production of certain of our higher margin vehicles. where we experience supply disruptions, we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly. any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of systems, components, raw materials or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules or suspend production entirely.
high prices of raw materials used by us and our suppliers could negatively impact our profitability. increases in prices for raw materials that we and our suppliers use in manufacturing products, systems, components and parts such as steel, precious metals, non-ferrous metals, including aluminum, copper and plastic parts may lead to higher production costs for parts and components. this could, in turn, negatively impact our future profitability because we may not be able to pass all of those costs on to our customers or require our suppliers to absorb such costs.
we operate in a highly competitive industry that has excess manufacturing capacity and attempts by our competitors to sell more vehicles could have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing, market share and operating results. the global automotive industry is highly competitive and overall manufacturing capacity in the industry far exceeds demand. many manufacturers have relatively high fixed labor costs as well as significant limitations on their ability to close facilities and reduce fixed costs. many of our competitors have responded to these relatively high fixed costs by providing subsidized financing or leasing programs, offering marketing incentives or reducing vehicle prices. as a result, we are not necessarily able to set our prices to offset higher costs of marketing incentives, commodity or other cost increases, or the impact of adverse currency fluctuations. our competitors may also seek to benefit from economies of scale by consolidating or entering into other strategic agreements such as alliances intended to enhance their competitiveness.
domestic manufacturers in lower cost countries, such as china and india, have become competitors in key emerging markets and announced their intention to export their products to established markets as a low cost alternative to established entry-level automobiles. in addition, foreign governments may decide to implement tax and other policies that favor their domestic manufacturers at the expense of international manufacturers, including gm and its joint venture partners. these actions have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing, market share and operating results.
competitors may independently develop products and services similar to ours, and there are no guarantees that gm's intellectual property rights would prevent competitors from independently developing or selling those product and services. there may be instances where, notwithstanding our intellectual property position, competitive products or services may impact the value of our brands and other intangible assets, and our business may be adversely affected. moreover, although gm takes
12
general motors company and subsidiaries reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of gm proprietary information, there can be no assurance that such efforts will completely deter misappropriation or improper use of our technology. we sometimes face attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology networks and systems for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secrets or confidential business information. the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position. in addition, we may be the target of enforcement of patents by third parties, including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claims by non-practicing entities. regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming. although we have taken steps to mitigate such risks, if we are found to infringe any third-party rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages or we could be enjoined from offering some of our products and services.
security breaches and other disruptions to information technology systems and networked products, including connected vehicles, owned or maintained by us, gm financial, or third-party vendors or suppliers on our behalf, could interfere with our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of private customer data or our proprietary information.  we rely upon information technology systems and manufacture networked products, some of which are managed by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, activities and products. additionally we and gm financial collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, proprietary business information of our dealers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. the secure operation of these systems and products, and the processing and maintenance of the information processed by these systems and products, is critical to our business operations and strategy. despite security measures and business continuity plans, these systems and products may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns caused by attacks by hackers, computer viruses, or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees, contractors and others who have access to these systems and products. the occurrence of any of these events could compromise the operational integrity of these systems and products. similarly, such an occurrence could result in the compromise or loss of the information processed by these systems and products. such events could result in, among other things, the loss of proprietary data, interruptions or delays in our business operations and damage to our reputation. in addition, such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information; disrupt operations; or reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technologies. we have experienced such events in the past and, although past events were immaterial, future events may occur and may be material.
portions of our information technology systems also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors due to regular maintenance efforts, such as systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming, disruptive and resource intensive. such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to design, manufacture and sell products and services, and interrupt other business processes.
security breaches and other disruptions of our in-vehicle systems could impact the safety of our customers and reduce confidence in gm and our products. our vehicles contain complex information technology systems. these systems control various vehicle functions including engine, transmission, safety, steering, navigation, acceleration, braking, window and door lock functions. we have designed, implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to these systems. however, hackers have reportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use such systems to gain control of, or to change, our vehicles' functionality, user interface and performance characteristics, or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle. any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicles or their systems or any loss of data could impact the safety of our customers or result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties. in addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our vehicles, their systems or data could negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
our products are subject to extensive laws, governmental regulations and policies, that can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business. we are significantly affected by governmental regulations that can increase costs related to the production of our vehicles and affect our product portfolio. meeting or exceeding many of these regulations is costly and often technologically challenging with respect to mandated emissions and fuel economy standards, especially where standards may not be harmonized across jurisdictions. we anticipate that the number and extent of these regulations, and the related costs and changes to our product portfolio, may increase significantly in the future. these government regulatory requirements could significantly affect our plans for global product development and given the uncertainty surrounding enforcement and regulatory definitions, may result in substantial costs, including civil or criminal penalties. in addition, an evolving but un-harmonized regulatory framework may limit or dictate the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them, which can affect revenue. refer to the "environmental and regulatory matters" section of item 1. business for further information on these regulatory requirements. we also expect that manufacturers will continue to be subject to increased scrutiny from regulators globally.
13
general motors company and subsidiaries we expect that to comply with fuel economy and emission control requirements we will be required to sell a significant volume of electric vehicles, as well as develop and implement new technologies for conventional internal combustion engines, all at increased cost levels. there are limits on our ability to achieve fuel economy improvements over a given time frame, however. there is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicles that use such new technologies on a profitable basis or that our customers will purchase such vehicles in the quantities necessary for us to comply with these regulatory programs.
in the current uncertain regulatory framework, environmental liabilities for which we may be responsible and that are not reasonably estimable could be substantial. alleged violations of safety or emissions standards could result in legal proceedings, the recall of one or more of our products, negotiated remedial actions, fines, restricted product offerings or a combination of any of those items. any of these actions could have substantial adverse effects on our operations including facility idling, reduced employment, increased costs and loss of revenue.
many of our advanced technologies, including autonomous, present novel issues with which domestic and foreign regulators have only limited experience and will be subject to evolving regulatory frameworks. any current or future regulations in these areas could impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.
we could be materially adversely affected by unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations or other proceedings.  we are subject to legal proceedings involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, stockholder litigation and proceedings related to the ignition switch recall. in addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. a negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result in the imposition of damages, including punitive damages, substantial fines, significant reputational harm, civil lawsuits and criminal penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well as significant legal and other costs. in addition, we may become obligated to issue up to 30 million shares of our common stock (subject to adjustment to take into account stock dividends, stock splits and other transactions) to the motors liquidation company guc trust (guc trust) under a provision of the amended and restated master sale and purchase agreement between us and general motors corporation and certain of its subsidiaries in the event that allowed general unsecured claims against the guc trust, as estimated by the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york (bankruptcy court), exceed $35.0 billion. at december 31, 2017, the bankruptcy court estimated that allowed general unsecured claims were approximately $31.9 billion.
if, in the discretion of the u.s. attorney's office for the southern district of new york (the u.s. attorney's office), we do not comply with the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement (the dpa), the u.s. attorney's office may prosecute us for charges alleged by the u.s. attorney's office including those relating to faulty ignition switches.  on september 17, 2015 we announced that we entered into the dpa with the u.s. attorney's office regarding its investigation of the events leading up to certain recalls announced in february and march of 2014 relating to faulty ignition switches. under the dpa, we consented to, among other things, the filing of a two-count information (the information) in the u.s. district court for the southern district of new york (the southern district) charging gm with a scheme to conceal material facts from a government regulator and wire fraud. we pled not guilty to the charges alleged in the information. the dpa further provides that, in the event the u.s. attorney's office determines during the period of deferral of prosecution (or any extensions thereof) that we have violated any provision of the dpa, including violating any u.s. federal law or our obligation to cooperate with and assist the independent monitor (the monitor), the u.s. attorney's office may, in its discretion, either prosecute us on the charges alleged in the information or impose an extension of the period of deferral of prosecution of up to one additional year. under such circumstance, the u.s. attorney's office would be permitted to rely upon the admissions we made in the dpa and would benefit from our waiver of certain procedural and evidentiary defenses. such a criminal prosecution could subject us to penalties.
the costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business.  government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns. under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for free repairs. at present, the costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. the costs to complete a recall or customer satisfaction action could be exacerbated to the extent that such action relates to a global platform. concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like autonomous, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence, can result in product delays, recalls, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements, and reputational damage. these circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the company's products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.
14
general motors company and subsidiaries we currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts, including but not limited to air bag inflators, from third parties. from time to time these items may have performance, quality or reputational issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs. for example, we are currently conducting recalls for certain takata air bag inflators used in some of our prior model year vehicles. further recalls, if any, that may be required to remediate takata air bag inflators in our vehicles could have a material impact on our business.
for a further discussion of these matters refer to note 17 to our consolidated financial statements.
we may continue to restructure or divest our operations in various countries, but we may not succeed in doing so.  in 2017, we announced significant restructuring and cost reduction actions to lower our operating costs in response to difficult market and operating conditions in various parts of the world. as we continue to assess our performance throughout our regions, we may take additional restructuring actions to rationalize our operations, which may result in impairments and reduce our profitability in the periods incurred. in addition, we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future cost reduction actions in full or in part or within the time periods we expect. we are also subject to the risks of labor unrest, negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our cost reduction actions. failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.
our future competitiveness and ability to achieve long-term profitability depends on our ability to control our costs, which requires us to successfully implement operating effectiveness initiatives throughout our operations.  we are continuing to implement a number of operating effectiveness initiatives to improve productivity and reduce costs. our future competitiveness depends upon our continued success in implementing these initiatives throughout our operations. while some of the elements of cost reduction are within our control, others, such as interest rates or return on investments, which influence our expense for pensions, depend more on external factors, and there can be no assurance that such external factors will not materially adversely affect our ability to reduce our costs. reducing costs may prove difficult due to our focus on increasing advertising and our belief that engineering and other expenses necessary to improve the performance, safety and customer satisfaction of our vehicles and to continue to innovate our technology, product and service offerings to meet changing customer needs and market developments are likely to increase.
we rely on gm financial to provide financial services to our dealers and customers in a majority of the markets in which we sell vehicles. gm financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations and its ability to provide leasing and financing to retail consumers and commercial lending to our dealers to support additional sales of our vehicles. we rely on gm financial in north america, south america and china to support leasing and sales of our vehicles to consumers requiring vehicle financing and also to provide commercial lending to our dealers. any reduction in gm financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among consumers and dealers.
as an entity operating in the financial services sector, gm financial is required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations that may be costly to adhere to and may affect our consolidated operating results. compliance with these laws and regulations requires that gm financial maintain forms, processes, procedures, controls and the infrastructure to support these requirements and these laws and regulations often create operational constraints both on gm financial's ability to implement servicing procedures and on pricing. laws in the financial services industry are designed primarily for the protection of consumers. the failure to comply with these laws could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalties, monetary damages, attorneys' fees and costs, possible revocation of licenses and damage to reputation, brand and valued customer relationships.
the primary factors that could adversely affect gm financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services at competitive rates include the availability of borrowings under its credit facilities to fund its retail and commercial finance activities; its ability to access a variety of financing sources including the asset-backed securities market and other secured and unsecured debt markets; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by delinquencies, defaults or prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; higher than expected vehicle return rates and the residual value performance on vehicles gm financial leases to customers; fluctuations in interest rates and currencies; and changes to regulation, supervision and licensing across various jurisdictions, including new regulations or sanctions imposed in the u.s. by the department of justice, sec and consumer financial protection bureau.
our defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded and our pension funding requirements could increase significantly due to a reduction in funded status as a result of a variety of factors, including weak performance of financial markets, declining interest rates, changes in laws or regulations, changes in assumptions or investments that do not achieve
15
general motors company and subsidiaries adequate returns. our employee benefit plans currently hold a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities. a detailed description of the investment funds and strategies and our potential funding requirements are disclosed in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements, which also describes significant concentrations of risk to the plan investments.
our future funding requirements for our u.s. defined benefit pension plans depend upon the future performance of assets placed in trusts for these plans, the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels, the level of benefits provided for by the plans and any changes in laws and regulations. future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset returns are lower than expected asset returns, assuming other factors are held constant. we estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions.
there are additional risks due to the complexity and magnitude of our investments. examples include implementation of significant changes in investment policy, insufficient market liquidity in particular asset classes and the inability to quickly rebalance illiquid and long-term investments.
factors which affect future funding requirements for our u.s. defined benefit plans generally affect the required funding for non-u.s. plans. certain plans outside the u.s. do not have assets and therefore the obligation is funded as benefits are paid. if local legal authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our non-u.s. plans, we could be required to contribute more funds.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes. forward-looking statements in this md&a are not guarantees of future performance and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. refer to the "forward-looking statements" section of this md&a and item 1a. "risk factors" for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties.
18
general motors company and subsidiaries non-gaap measures unless otherwise indicated, our non-gaap measures discussed in this md&a are related to our continuing operations and not our discontinued operations or our assets and liabilities held for sale. our non-gaap measures include earnings before interest and taxes (ebit)-adjusted, presented net of noncontrolling interests, earnings per share (eps)-diluted-adjusted, effective tax rate-adjusted (etr-adjusted), return on invested capital-adjusted (roic-adjusted) and adjusted automotive free cash flow. our calculation of these non-gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. as a result, the use of these non-gaap measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for, related u.s. gaap measures.
these non-gaap measures allow management and investors to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions to understand operating performance without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance. furthermore, these non-gaap measures allow investors the opportunity to measure and monitor our performance against our externally communicated targets and evaluate the investment decisions being made by management to improve roic-adjusted. management uses these measures in its financial, investment and operational decision-making processes, for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes. further, our board of directors uses certain of these and other measures as key metrics to determine management performance under our performance-based compensation plans. for these reasons we believe these non-gaap measures are useful for our investors.
ebit-adjusted ebit-adjusted is presented net of noncontrolling interests and is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated operating results because it excludes automotive interest income, automotive interest expense and income taxes as well as certain additional adjustments that are not considered part of our core operations. examples of adjustments to ebit include but are not limited to impairment charges related to goodwill; impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions; costs arising from the ignition switch recall and related legal matters; and certain currency devaluations associated with hyperinflationary economies. for ebit-adjusted and our other non-gaap measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-gaap measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item.
core ebit-adjusted beginning in 2018, we intend to report a core ebit-adjusted metric. core ebit-adjusted will be used by management and can be used by investors to review our core consolidated operating results. core ebit-adjusted begins with ebit-adjusted and excludes the ebit-adjusted results of our autonomous vehicle operations, including cruise automation inc. (cruise), maven and our investment in lyft.
eps-diluted-adjusted eps-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted eps results on a consistent basis. eps-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholders-diluted less income (loss) from discontinued operations on an after-tax basis, adjustments noted above for ebit-adjusted, gains or losses on the extinguishment of debt obligations on an after-tax basis and certain income tax adjustments divided by weighted-average common shares outstanding-diluted. examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or reversal of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.
etr-adjusted etr-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. etr-adjusted is calculated as income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for ebit-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for eps-diluted-adjusted divided by income before income taxes less adjustments.
roic-adjusted roic-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our investment and capital allocation decisions. we define roic-adjusted as ebit-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by roic-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of capital leases; average automotive net pension and other postretirement benefits (opeb) liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period. adjustments to the average equity balances exclude assets and liabilities classified as either assets held for sale or liabilities held for sale.
adjusted automotive free cash flow adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. we measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from continuing operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions, primarily related to strengthening our balance sheet, such as prepayments of debt and discretionary
19
general motors company and subsidiaries contributions to employee benefit plans. refer to the "liquidity and capital resources" section of this md&a for our reconciliation of net automotive cash provided by operating activities under u.s. gaap to this non-gaap measure.
core adjusted automotive free cash flow beginning in 2018, we intend to report a core adjusted automotive free cash flow metric. core adjusted automotive free cash flow will be used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. core adjusted automotive free cash flow begins with adjusted automotive free cash flow and excludes the cash flows of our autonomous vehicle operations, including cruise, maven and our investment in lyft.
the following table reconciles net income (loss) attributable to stockholders under u.s. gaap to ebit-adjusted:
years ended december 31,

________
(a)   this adjustment was excluded because of a strategic decision to rationalize our core operations by exiting or significantly reducing our presence in various international markets to focus resources on opportunities expected to deliver higher returns. the adjustment primarily consists of asset impairments, sales incentives, inventory provisions, dealer restructuring, employee separations and other contract cancellation costs in india, south africa, and thailand.
(b)   in the year ended december 31, 2017 this adjustment was excluded because we ceased operations and terminated employment relationships in venezuela. in the year ended december 31, 2015 this adjustment was excluded because of the devaluation of the venezuela bolivar fuerte (bsf) and our inability to transact to obtain u.s. dollars.
(c)   these adjustments were excluded because of the unique events associated with the ignition switch recall. these events included the creation of the compensation program, as well as various investigations, inquiries and complaints from constituents.
(d)   these adjustments were excluded because of our decision to exit the russia market in 2015. the russia exit costs primarily consisted of sales incentives, dealer restructuring and other contract cancellation costs and asset impairments.

(b)   the tax effect of each adjustment is determined based on the tax laws and valuation allowance status of the jurisdiction to which the adjustment relates.
(c)   in the year ended december 31, 2017 these adjustments consist of the tax expense of $7.3 billion related to u.s. tax reform legislation and the establishment of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of $2.3 billion that will no longer be realizable as a result of the sale of the opel/vauxhall business, partially offset by tax benefits related to tax settlements. in the year ended december 31, 2015 these adjustments primarily consist of the tax benefit related to the valuation allowance reversal in europe. these adjustments were excluded because impacts of tax legislation and valuation allowances are not considered part of our core operations.

overview our management team has adopted a strategic plan to transform gm into the world's most valued automotive company. our plan includes several major initiatives that we anticipate will redefine the future of personal mobility through our zero crashes, zero emissions, zero congestion vision while also strengthening the core of our business: earning customers for life by delivering winning vehicles, leading the industry in quality and safety and improving the customer ownership experience; leading in technology and innovation, including electrification, autonomous, data monetization and connectivity; growing our brands; making tough, strategic decisions about which markets and products in which we will invest and compete; building profitable adjacent businesses and targeting 10% core margins on an ebit-adjusted basis.
in addition to our ebit-adjusted margin improvement goal, our overall financial targets include total annual operational and functional cost savings of $6.5 billion through 2018 compared to 2014 costs, of which approximately $5.5 billion has been realized as of december 31, 2017, and which will more than offset our planned incremental investments in brand building, engineering and technology as we launch new products; and execution of our capital allocation program as described in the "liquidity and capital resources" section of this md&a.
for the year ending december 31, 2018 we expect eps-diluted and eps-diluted-adjusted to be in the mid-six dollar range. we do not consider the potential future impact of adjustments on our expected financial results. we expect core ebit-adjusted and core adjusted automotive free cash flow to be in line with 2017. core consists of all operations excluding our autonomous vehicle operations, including cruise, maven car sharing entities, and our investment in lyft.
we face continuing challenges from a market, operating and regulatory standpoint in a number of countries across the globe due to, among other factors, weak economic conditions, competitive pressures, our product portfolio offerings, emissions standards, foreign exchange volatility and political uncertainty. as a result of these conditions, we continue to strategically assess our performance and ability to achieve acceptable returns on our invested capital. refer to item1a. risk factors for a discussion of these challenges. as we continue to assess our performance, additional restructuring and rationalization actions may be required or determination may be made that the carrying amount of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable in certain of these countries. such a determination may give rise to future asset impairments or other charges which may have a material impact on our results of operations.
gmna in the year ended december 31, 2017 industry sales in north america were 21.5 million units representing a decrease of 1.5% compared to the corresponding period in 2016. u.s. industry sales were 17.6 million units in the year ended december 31, 2017.
in the year ended december 31, 2017 our vehicle sales in the u.s., our largest market in north america, totaled 3.0 million units for market share of 17.1%, representing an increase of 0.1 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2016. we continue to lead the u.s. industry in market share.
we achieved ebit-adjusted margins of 10.7% on continued strength of u.s. industry light vehicle sales, key product launches and continued focus on overall cost savings. based on our current cost structure, we estimate gmna's breakeven point at the u.s. industry level to be in the range of 10.0 to 11.0 million units. we expect to sustain an ebit-adjusted margin of 10% in 2018 on continued strength of u.s. industry light vehicle sales, favorable mix of full-size trucks and crossovers relative to passenger cars, key product launches and continued focus on overall cost savings.

general motors company and subsidiaries gmi in the year ended december 31, 2017 china industry sales were 28.3 million units and our market share was 14.3%. we continue to see strength in sales of our cadillac and baojun passenger vehicles and suvs, as well as positive momentum in chevrolet sales driven by new product launches. wuling sales were impacted by the market shift away from mini commercial vehicles. in the year ended december 31, 2017 our automotive china jvs generated equity income of $2.0 billion. we expect low industry growth in 2018 and continuation of pricing pressures, which will continue to pressure margins. we continue to expect equal to increased vehicle sales in 2018 driven by new launches and expect to sustain strong china equity income by focusing on improvements in vehicle mix, cost efficiencies, and downstream performance optimization.
many markets across the region continue to improve led by increases in argentina and brazil leading to industry sales of 25.2 million units, representing an increase of 4.0% in the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the corresponding period in 2016. in the year ended december 31, 2017 our retail sales totaled 1.3 million units leading to a market share of 5.1%, representing a decrease of 0.3 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2016.
in may 2017 we announced several restructuring actions in gmi which were primarily related to the withdrawal of chevrolet from the indian and south african markets at the end of 2017 and the transition of our south african manufacturing operations to isuzu motors. these actions occurred as a result of a strategic decision to focus resources on opportunities expected to deliver higher returns. refer to note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these restructuring actions. in may 2017 we deconsolidated our business in venezuela which resulted in a charge of $0.1 billion during the year ended december 31, 2017.
gm korea company (gm korea) entered into a collectively bargained wage agreement which was ratified by its union in january 2018. the impact of the agreement was not material to our consolidated financial statements.
we have had recent discussions with key stakeholders in gm korea, including its minority owners and union, regarding the need to improve gm korea's financial and operational performance. as we strategically assess our performance and the manner in which we operate in korea and certain other countries, additional restructuring and rationalization actions may be required and may have a material impact on our results of operations.
corporate beginning in 2012 through january 30, 2018, we purchased an aggregate of 504 million shares of our outstanding common stock for $16.2 billion.
the ignition switch recall has led to various inquiries, investigations, subpoenas, requests for information and complaints from agencies or other representatives of u.s., federal, state and canadian governments. in addition these and other recalls have resulted in a number of claims and lawsuits. such lawsuits and investigations could in the future result in the imposition of material damages, fines, civil consent orders, civil and criminal penalties or other remedies. refer to note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
takata matters in may 2016 nhtsa issued an amended consent order requiring takata to file defect information reports (dirs) for previously unrecalled front airbag inflators that contain phased-stabilized ammonium nitrate-based propellant without a moisture absorbing desiccant on a multi-year, risk-based schedule through 2019 impacting tens of millions of vehicles produced by numerous automotive manufacturers. nhtsa concluded that the likely root cause of the rupturing of the airbag inflators is a function of time, temperature cycling and environmental moisture.
although we do not believe there is a safety defect at this time in any unrecalled gm vehicles within scope of the takata dirs, in cooperation with nhtsa we filed preliminary dirs on may 27, 2016, updated as of june 13, 2016, covering 2.5 million of certain of our gmt900 vehicles, which are full-size pick-up trucks and suvs. on november 15, 2016, we filed a petition for inconsequentiality and request for deferral of determination regarding those gmt900 vehicles. on november 28, 2016, nhtsa granted gm's deferral request in connection with this petition. the deferral provides gm until august 31, 2017 to present evidence and analysis that our vehicles do not pose an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety.
we filed a second set of preliminary dirs for certain gmt900 vehicles on january 10, 2017. these january 2017 dirs are consistent with gm's may 2016 dirs. on the same day, we also filed a second petition for inconsequentiality and deferral of decision with respect to the vehicles subject to our january 2017 dirs. on january 18, 2017, nhtsa consolidated our first and second petitions for inconsequentiality and will rule on both at the same time.
23
general motors company and subsidiaries on august 25, 2017, we filed a supplemental brief in support of our petitions that provided nhtsa with the results of our long-term study and testing and the basis for our determination that the inflators in these vehicles do not present an unreasonable risk to safety and that no repair should ultimately be required. in our brief, we requested that nhtsa grant our petitions or, in the alternative, grant an additional deferral period to provide time for further testing.
we filed a third set of preliminary dirs for certain gmt900 vehicles on january 9, 2018. these january 2018 dirs are consistent with gm's may 2016 dirs and january 2017 dirs. on the same day, we also filed a third petition for inconsequentiality with respect to the vehicles subject to our january 2018 dirs.
we believe these vehicles are currently performing as designed and ongoing testing continues to support the belief that the vehicles' unique design and integration mitigates against inflator propellant degradation and rupture risk. for example, the airbag inflators used in the vehicles are a variant engineered specifically for our vehicles, and include features such as greater venting, unique propellant wafer configurations, and machined steel end caps. the inflators are packaged in the instrument panel in such a way as to minimize exposure to moisture from the climate control system. also, these vehicles have features that minimize the maximum temperature to which the inflator will be exposed, such as larger interior volumes and standard solar absorbing windshields and side glass.
accordingly, no warranty provision has been made for any repair associated with our vehicles subject to the preliminary dirs and amended consent order. however, in the event we are ultimately obligated to repair the vehicles subject to current or future takata dirs under the amended consent order in the u.s., we estimate a reasonably possible impact to gm of approximately $1.0 billion.
gm is engaged in discussions with regulators outside the u.s. with respect to takata inflators. there are differences in vehicle and inflator design between the relevant vehicles sold internationally and those sold in the u.s. we continue to gather and analyze evidence about these inflators and to share our findings with regulators. we were required to recall certain vehicles sold outside of the u.s. in the three months ended september 30, 2017 to replace takata inflators in these vehicles. additional recalls, if any, could be material to our results of operations and cash flows. we continue to monitor the international situation.
on june 26, 2017, takata filed for bankruptcy protection in the united states and japan. over the past several months, a group of global automakers, including gm, have had discussions with takata and key safety systems, inc. regarding a potential transaction involving the sale of takata's business. gm has not experienced any supply interruptions arising from takata initiating formal insolvency proceedings and anticipates that takata will continue an uninterrupted supply of component parts to gm during the insolvency proceedings. gm continues to monitor takata's financial and operational performance and to develop alternative and contingent supplies to attempt to mitigate prospective threats to the supply of components.
psa group transaction on july 31, 2017 we closed the sale of our opel/vauxhall business to psa group and on october 31, 2017 we closed the sale of the fincos to banque psa finance s.a. and bnp paribas personal finance s.a.
the net consideration paid at closing for the european business was $2.5 billion, consisting of (1) $2.2 billion in cash; and (2) $0.8 billion in warrants in psa group; partially offset by (3) the $0.5 billion de-risking premium payment made to psa group for assuming certain underfunded pension liabilities. in addition, we agreed to sell the shares of psa group received upon exercise of the warrants within 35 days after exercise. the purchase price is subject to certain working capital adjustments as provided in the master agreement (the agreement).
the total charge from the sale of the european business was $6.2 billion, net of tax, of which $3.9 billion is recorded in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, and $2.3 billion was treated as an adjustment to both eps-diluted-adjusted and etr-adjusted. the charge relates to: (1) $4.3 billion of deferred tax assets that will no longer be realizable or that transferred to psa group; (2) $1.5 billion related to previously deferred pension losses and payment of the de-risking premium to psa group for its assumption of certain underfunded pension liabilities; (3) a pre-tax disposal loss of $0.5 billion as a result of the sale of the fincos, which includes the recognition of $0.2 billion of foreign currency translation losses; (4) a pre-tax charge of $0.4 billion for the cancellation of production programs resulting from the convergence of vehicle platforms between the european business and psa group; and (5) other costs to support the separation of operations to be provided for a period of time following closing; partially offset by proceeds.
our wholly owned subsidiary (the seller) has agreed to indemnify psa group for certain losses resulting from any inaccuracy of the representations and warranties or breaches of our covenants included in the agreement and for certain other liabilities, including emissions and product liabilities. the company has entered into a guarantee for the benefit of psa group and pursuant
24
general motors company and subsidiaries to which the company has agreed to guarantee the seller's obligation to indemnify psa group. certain of these indemnification obligations are subject to time limitations, thresholds and/or caps as to the amount of required payments. we are currently unable to estimate any reasonably possible overall amounts or range of loss that may result from claims made under these indemnities, if any.
psa group has provided a number of working capital and other adjustments under the agreement and other ancillary agreements, many of which are customary in these types of transactions. we currently believe that post-closing adjustments under the agreement, if any, would not have a material impact on our results of operations.
we retained net underfunded pension liabilities of $6.8 billion owed primarily to current pensioners and former employees of the european business with vested pension rights. psa group assumed, pursuant to the agreement, approximately $3.1 billion of net underfunded pension liabilities primarily with respect to active employees of the opel/vauxhall business, and during the three months ended september 30, 2017 the seller made payments of $3.4 billion in respect of these assumed liabilities, which includes pension funding payments for active employees and the de-risking premium payment discussed above. at closing we drew upon our three-year unsecured revolving credit facility to fund these payments. we issued debt securities thereafter to repay the draw on our credit facility. as part of the retained pension liabilities described above, we retained the u.k. defined benefit pension plans in existence at signing related to the opel/vauxhall business, including responsibility for service cost accruals through the closing date.
we have agreed to purchase from and supply to psa group certain vehicles for a period of time following closing and not to engage in certain competing businesses in europe for a period of three years.

contingently issuable shares  under the amended and restated master sale and purchase agreement between us and motors liquidation company we may be obligated to issue additional shares (adjustment shares) of our common stock in the event that allowed general unsecured claims against the guc trust, as estimated by the bankruptcy court, exceed $35.0 billion. refer to note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the contingently issuable adjustment shares.
automotive financing - gm financial summary and outlook gm financial has expanded its leasing and prime lending programs in north america; therefore, leasing and prime lending have become a larger percentage of the originations and retail portfolio balance. during 2017 we saw used car prices in the u.s. decline approximately 5% as compared to 2016. for 2018, an increasing supply of used vehicles resulting from off-lease returns will continue to pressure used car prices. as a result, we expect a further decline in used car prices in the u.s. between 5% and 6% in 2018 as compared to 2017. gm financial continues to expect pre-tax income to double from 2014 earnings of $0.8 billion once full captive penetration levels are achieved on a consistent basis. the following table summarizes the residual value as well as the number of units included in gm financial equipment on operating leases, net by vehicle type (units in thousands):

gm financial's retail penetration in north america grew to approximately 37% in the year ended december 31, 2017 from approximately 33% in 2016 as a result of the expanded leasing and lending programs. in the year ended december 31, 2017 gm financial's revenue consisted of leased vehicle income of 71%, retail finance charge income of 23%, and commercial finance charge income of 3%. we believe that offering a comprehensive suite of financing products will generate incremental sales of our vehicles, drive incremental gm financial earnings and help support our sales throughout various economic cycles.

the most significant element of our automotive cost of sales is material cost which makes up approximately two-thirds of the total amount. the remaining portion includes labor costs, depreciation and amortization, engineering, and product warranty and recall campaigns.
factors which most significantly influence a region's profitability are industry volume, market share, and the relative mix of vehicles (cars, trucks, crossovers) sold. variable profit is a key indicator of product profitability. variable profit is defined as revenue less material cost, freight, the variable component of manufacturing expense and warranty and recall-related costs. vehicles with higher selling prices generally have higher variable profit. refer to the regional sections of this md&a for additional information on volume and mix.

liquidity and capital resources we believe that our current level of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and availability under our revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs. we expect to have substantial cash requirements going forward which we plan to fund through total available liquidity and cash flows generated from operations and future debt issuances. we also maintain access to the capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities from time to time, which may provide an additional source of liquidity. our future uses of cash, which may vary from time to time based on market conditions and other factors, are focused on three objectives: (1) reinvest in our business; (2) maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet; and (3) return available cash to shareholders. our known future material uses of cash include, among other possible demands: (1) capital expenditures of approximately $8.5 billion annually as well as payments for engineering and product
31
general motors company and subsidiaries development activities; (2) payments associated with previously announced vehicle recalls, the settlements of the multidistrict litigation and any other recall-related contingencies; (3) payments to service debt and other long-term obligations, including discretionary and mandatory contributions to our pension plans; (4) dividend payments on our common stock that are declared by our board of directors; and (5) payments to purchase shares of our common stock authorized by our board of directors.
our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the "forward-looking statements" section of this md&a and item 1a. risk factors, some of which are outside of our control.
we continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities to strengthen our competitive position over the long-term while maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet. these actions may include opportunistic payments to reduce our long-term obligations as well as the possibility of acquisitions, dispositions, investments with joint venture partners and strategic alliances that we believe would generate significant advantages and substantially strengthen our business. these actions may negatively impact our liquidity in the short term.
our senior management evaluates our capital allocation program on an ongoing basis and recommends any modifications to the program to our board of directors, not less than once annually. management reaffirmed and our board of directors approved the capital allocation program, which includes reinvesting in our business at an average target roic-adjusted rate of 20% or greater, maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet, including a target cash balance of $18 billion, and returning available cash to shareholders.
as part of our capital allocation program, we announced in january 2016 that our board of directors had authorized a program to purchase up to $4 billion of our common stock before the end of 2017, which was completed in the three months ended september 30, 2017. we also announced in january 2017 that our board of directors had authorized the purchase of up to an additional $5 billion of our common stock with no expiration date, subsequent to completing the remaining portion of the previously announced programs. we completed $1.5 billion of the $5 billion program in the three months ended december 31, 2017. from inception of the program in 2015 through january 30, 2018 we had purchased an aggregate of 299 million shares of our outstanding common stock under our common stock repurchase program for $10.5 billion. in the year ended december 31, 2017, we returned total cash to shareholders of $6.7 billion, consisting of dividends paid on our common stock and purchases of our common stock.
in august 2017 we issued $3.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and used the net proceeds to repay the $3.0 billion drawn on our three-year unsecured revolving credit facility to fund the payments to psa group, or one or more pension funding vehicles, for the assumed net underfunded pension liabilities in connection with the sale of the opel/vauxhall business. refer to note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the senior unsecured notes.
automotive liquidity total available liquidity includes cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and funds available under credit facilities. the amount of available liquidity is subject to intra-month and seasonal fluctuations and includes balances held by various business units and subsidiaries worldwide that are needed to fund their operations.
we manage our liquidity primarily at our treasury centers as well as at certain of our significant consolidated overseas subsidiaries. approximately 90% of our cash and marketable securities were managed within north america and at our regional treasury centers at december 31, 2017. we have used and will continue to use other methods including intercompany loans to utilize these funds across our global operations as needed.
our cash equivalents and marketable securities balances are primarily denominated in u.s. dollars and include investments in u.s. government and agency obligations, foreign government securities, time deposits, corporate debt securities and mortgage and asset-backed securities. our investment guidelines, which we may change from time to time, prescribe certain minimum credit worthiness thresholds and limit our exposures to any particular sector, asset class, issuance or security type. the majority of our current investments in debt securities are with a/a2 or better rated issuers.
we use credit facilities as a mechanism to provide additional flexibility in managing our global liquidity. the total size of our credit facilities was $14.5 billion at december 31, 2017 and 2016, which consisted principally of our two primary revolving credit facilities. we did not have any borrowings against our primary facilities, but had letters of credit outstanding under our sub-facility of $0.4 billion at december 31, 2017 and 2016. gm financial had access to our revolving credit facilities at december 31, 2017 and 2016 but did not borrow against them. refer to note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on credit facilities. at december 31, 2017 and 2016 we had intercompany loans from gm financial of $0.4 billion and $0.3 billion, which consisted primarily of commercial loans to dealers we consolidate, and we had no intercompany loans to gm financial.

general motors company and subsidiaries as a means to access the strong liquidity available in our china jvs, from time to time, we may borrow from our joint ventures to provide additional liquidity to support our operations and capital investment. in the three months ending march 31, 2018, we expect to borrow approximately $1.3 billion from saic general motors corp., ltd. (sgm) pursuant to a short-term unsecured note payable.

in the year ended december 31, 2017 the decrease in net automotive cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to unfavorable impacts from: (1) decreased income (loss) from continuing operations partially offset by the add back of $7.3 billion
33
general motors company and subsidiaries as a result of u.s. tax reform legislation and the establishment of a $2.3 billion valuation allowance related to the sale of the opel/vauxhall business; (2) a decrease in accrued and other liabilities due to increased sales allowance payments; (3) a decrease in equipment on operating leases due to an increase in units out to daily rental car companies; and (4) a decrease in working capital due to lower production volumes, partially offset by accelerated cash receipts from gm financial and other external sources totaling $0.5 billion; partially offset by (5) discretionary contributions of $2.0 billion made to our u.s. hourly pension plan in the year ended december 31, 2016; and (6) an increase in other due to several insignificant items.
in the year ended december 31, 2016 the increase in net automotive cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to: (1) an increase in income taxes due primarily to the reversal of valuation allowances in 2015; (2) an increase in accrued and other liabilities due primarily to an increase in sales incentives of $1.6 billion; (3) an increase in working capital due primarily to increased accounts payable due to increased production volumes and decreased inventories due to lower repurchased rental car activity; partially offset by (4) a decrease in pension and opeb activities due primarily to discretionary contributions of $2.0 billion made to our u.s. hourly pension plan in the year ended december 31, 2016 and pension income from the refinement to the discount rate methodology for service and interest cost; and (5) a decrease in other due primarily to foreign exchange and an increase in deposits.

general motors company and subsidiaries in the year ended december 31, 2017 available liquidity increased due primarily to an increase in cash and additional net borrowing capacity on new and renewed secured credit facilities, resulting from the issuance of securitizations, unsecured debt and preferred stock.
gm financial has the ability to borrow up to $1.0 billion against our three-year, $4.0 billion revolving credit facility and up to $3.0 billion against our five-year, $10.5 billion revolving credit facility. we have a support agreement with gm financial which, among other things, establishes commitments of funding from us to gm financial. this agreement also provides that we will continue to own all of gm financial's outstanding voting shares so long as any unsecured debt securities remain outstanding at gm financial. in addition we are required to use our commercially reasonable efforts to ensure gm financial remains a subsidiary borrower under our corporate revolving credit facilities.
credit facilities in the normal course of business, in addition to using its available cash, gm financial utilizes borrowings under its credit facilities, which may be secured or unsecured, and gm financial repays these borrowings as appropriate under its cash management strategy. at december 31, 2017 secured, committed unsecured and uncommitted unsecured credit facilities totaled $26.0 billion, $0.1 billion and $2.4 billion with advances outstanding of $4.7 billion, an insignificant amount and $2.4 billion.

(a)   amounts include automotive interest payments based on contractual terms and current interest rates on our debt and capital lease obligations. automotive interest payments based on variable interest rates were determined using the interest rate in effect at december 31, 2017.
(b)   gm financial interest payments were determined using the interest rate in effect at december 31, 2017 for floating rate debt and the contractual rates for fixed rate debt. gm financial interest payments on floating rate tranches of the securitization notes payable were converted to a fixed rate based on the floating rate plus any expected hedge payments.
(c)   amounts include opeb payments under the current u.s. contractual labor agreements through 2019 and canada labor agreements through 2021. these agreements are generally renegotiated in the year of expiration. amounts do not include pension funding obligations, which are discussed in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.
(d)   amounts do not include future cash payments for long-term purchase obligations and other accrued expenditures (unless specifically listed in the table above) which were recorded in accounts payable or accrued liabilities at december 31, 2017.
(e)   amounts include all expected future payments for both current and expected future service at december 31, 2017 for opeb obligations for salaried and hourly employees extending beyond the current north american union contract agreements, workers' compensation and extended disability benefits. amounts do not include pension funding obligations, which are discussed in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.
the table above does not reflect product warranty and related liabilities, certified pre-owned extended warranty and free maintenance of $9.1 billion and unrecognized tax benefits of $1.6 billion due to the uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows potentially associated with these amounts.
critical accounting estimates accounting estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements. these estimates require the use of judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented. we believe the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates.
pension and opeb plans our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, a discount rate, mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement. the expected long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return.

general motors company and subsidiaries in december 2017 an investment policy study was completed for the u.s. pension plans. as a result of changes to our capital market assumptions, primarily those related to the fixed income asset class, the weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets increased from 6.2% at december 31, 2016 to 6.6% at december 31, 2017. the assumption change related to the fixed income asset class is expected to increase the return on assets by $0.3 billion in 2018. the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for non-u.s. plans is determined in a similar manner to the u.s. plans.
another key assumption in determining net pension and opeb expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligations. we estimate the assumed discount rate for u.s. plans using a cash flow matching approach, which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the weighted-average discount rate for the calculation of the present value of cash flows. we apply the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount rate to determine the service cost and interest cost, which more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment.
we have reviewed the mortality improvement tables published by the society of actuaries in the three months ended december 31, 2017 and determined that our current assumptions are appropriate to measure our december 31, 2017 u.s. pension plan obligations.
significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations. the effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to pension expense over future periods. the unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss on our pension plans was $4.0 billion and $3.8 billion at december 31, 2017 and 2016. the year-over-year change is primarily due to the decrease in discount rates partially offset by assumption changes and the increase in actual return on assets. at december 31, 2017 $2.4 billion of the unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss is outside the corridor (10% of the projected benefit obligation (pbo)) and subject to amortization. the weighted-average amortization period is approximately fifteen years resulting in amortization expense of $0.2 billion in 2018.
the underfunded status of the u.s. pension plans decreased by $1.4 billion in the year ended december 31, 2017 to $5.8 billion due primarily to: (1) a favorable effect of actual returns on plan assets of $6.5 billion; (2) other favorable changes including contributions, demographic gains and assumption changes of $0.4 billion; partially offset by (3) an unfavorable effect due to a decrease in the discount rate of $3.2 billion; and (4) service and interest cost of $2.3 billion.
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension plans, holding all other assumptions constant:

valuation of deferred tax assets the ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. the assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible sources of taxable income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors. our accounting for the valuation of deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events. changes in our current estimates, due to unanticipated market conditions, governmental legislative actions or events, could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets.

general motors company and subsidiaries at december 31, 2017 total deferred tax assets were $30.7 billion and valuation allowances against those deferred tax assets were $6.7 billion. refer to note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the composition of these valuation allowances and for information on the impact of u.s. tax reform legislation.
valuation of gm financial equipment on operating leases assets and residuals gm financial has investments in leased vehicles recorded as operating leases, which relate to vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms which typically range from two to five years. at the beginning of the lease an estimate is made of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term. the expected residual value is based on third-party data which considers inputs including recent auction values, the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles, used car prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices. the customer is obligated to make payments during the term of the lease for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a money factor. since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, we are exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle at the end of the lease term and the value of the vehicle is below the expected residual value estimated at the inception of the lease.
the following table summarizes vehicles included in gm financial equipment on operating leases, net (vehicles in thousands):
december 31, 2017         december 31, 2016
cars              450                       420
trucks            285                       224
crossovers        818                       604
suvs               99                        75
total           1,652                     1,323
at december 31, 2017 the estimated residual value of our leased assets at the end of the lease term was $30.4 billion. we periodically review the adequacy of the depreciation rates. if we believe that the expected residual values of the leased assets have changed, we revise the depreciation rate to ensure the net investment in the operating leases reflects the revised estimate of expected residual value at the end of the lease term. such adjustments to the depreciation rate would result in a change in depreciation expense on leased assets which is recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis. the following table illustrates the effect of a 1% change in the estimated residual values at december 31, 2017, which would increase or decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of our operating lease portfolio, holding all other assumptions constant:
impact to depreciation expense cars                             $57
trucks                            72
crossovers                       137
suvs                              38
total                           $304
we also evaluate the carrying value of the operating leases aggregated by vehicle make, year and model into leased asset groups, check for indicators of impairment and test for impairment to the extent necessary in accordance with applicable accounting standards. a leased asset group is considered impaired if impairment indicators exist and the undiscounted expected future cash flows (including the expected residual value) are lower than the carrying value of the asset group. we believe no impairment indicators existed during 2017, 2016 or 2015.
product warranty and recall campaigns the estimates related to product warranties are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events. when little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line, the estimate is based on comparable models.
in gmna we primarily accrue the costs for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale. in the other regions, there is not sufficient historical data to support the application of an actuarial-based estimation technique and the estimated costs are accrued at the time when they are probable and reasonably estimable, which typically occurs once it is determined a specific recall campaign is needed and announced.
39
general motors company and subsidiaries the estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a frequency times severity approach that considers the number of recall campaigns, the number of vehicles per recall campaign, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall campaign. these estimates consider the nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns. costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. these estimates are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors.
the estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the take rate, and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. the estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience. a 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.3 billion.
actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.
sales incentives the estimated effect of sales incentives offered to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of automotive net sales and revenue at the later of the time of sale or announcement of an incentive program to dealers. there may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time, including a choice of incentives for a specific model. incentive programs are generally brand specific, model specific or sales region specific and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include the volume of vehicles that will be affected by the incentive programs offered by product, the product mix, the rate of customer acceptance of any incentive program and the likelihood that an incentive program will be extended, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning customer behavior and future market conditions. when an incentive program is announced, the number of vehicles in dealer inventory eligible for the incentive program is determined and a reduction of automotive net sales and revenue is recorded in the period in which the program is announced. if the actual number of affected vehicles differs from this estimate, or if a different mix of incentives is actually paid, the reduction in automotive net sales and revenue due to incentives could be affected. there are a multitude of inputs affecting the calculation of the estimate for sales incentives and an increase or decrease in any of these variables could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives. on january 1, 2018, the date of our adoption of accounting standards update (asu) 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers" (asu 2014-09), sales incentives began to be recorded at the time of sale rather than at the later of sale or announcement. this change affected our processes for estimating and recording sales incentives. refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the adoption asu 2014-09.

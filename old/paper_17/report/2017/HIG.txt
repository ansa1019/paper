item 1a. risk factors in deciding whether to invest in the hartford, you should carefully consider the following risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation or liquidity and could also impact the trading price of our securities. these risks are not exclusive, and additional risks to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, the factors mentioned under "forward-looking statements" above and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
the following risk factors have been organized by category for ease of use, however many of the risks may have impacts in more than one category. the occurrence of certain of them may, in turn, cause the emergence or exacerbate the effect of others. such a combination could materially increase the severity of the impact of these risks on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
as noted below under "risks relating to the pending sale of our life and annuity business," the assets and liabilities of the life and annuity run-off business, consisting primarily of the operations of hartford life insurance company and hartford life and annuity insurance company (formerly known as talcott resolution), have been accounted for as held for sale as of december 31, 2017, with the operating results of that business included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. the company expects the sale to close by june 30, 2018, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions.  apart from interest expense on debt issued and outstanding of hartford life, inc., the holding company of the life and annuity run-off business, and certain tax benefits to be retained by the hartford, the results from the discontinued operations inure to the buyer. accordingly, any earnings or losses of the life and annuity run-off business up until closing will not change the company's results. if the sale of the business does not close, we would retain the risks associated with the life and annuity run-off business.
risks relating to economic, political and global market conditions unfavorable economic, political and global market conditions may adversely impact our business and results of operations.
the company's investment portfolio and insurance liabilities are sensitive to changes in economic, political and global capital market conditions, such as the effect of a weak economy and changes in credit spreads, equity prices, interest rates and inflation. weak economic conditions, such as high unemployment, low labor force participation, lower family income, a weak real estate market, lower business investment and lower consumer spending may adversely affect the demand for insurance and financial products and lower the company's profitability in some cases. in addition, the company's investment portfolio includes limited partnerships and other alternative investments for which changes in value are reported in earnings. these investments may be adversely impacted by political turmoil and economic volatility, including real estate market deterioration, which could impact our net investment returns and result in an adverse impact on operating results.
below are several key factors impacted by changes in economic, political, and global market conditions and their potential effect on the company's business and results of operation:
•   credit spread risk- credit spread exposure is reflected in the market prices of fixed income instruments where lower rated securities generally trade at a higher credit spread. if issuer credit spreads increase or widen, the market value of our investment portfolio may decline. if the credit spread widening is significant and occurs over an extended period of time, the company may recognize other-than-temporary impairments, resulting in decreased earnings. if credit spreads tighten, significantly, the company's net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed maturities may be reduced. in addition, the value of credit derivatives under which the company assumes exposure or purchases protection are impacted by changes in credit spreads, with losses occurring when credit spreads widen for assumed exposure or, when credit spreads tighten if credit protection has been purchased.
•   equity markets risk - a decline in equity markets may result in unrealized capital losses on investments in equity securities recorded against net income and lower earnings from mutual funds where fee income is earned based upon the fair value of the assets under management. equity markets are unpredictable. in early 2018, the equity markets were more volatile than in the months prior, which could be indicative of a greater risk of a decline.
•   interest rate risk - global economic conditions may result in the persistence of a low interest rate environment which would continue to pressure our net investment income and could result in lower margins on certain products.
new and renewal business for our property and casualty and group benefits products is priced based on prevailing interest rates. as interest rates decline, in order to achieve the same economic return, we would have to increase product prices to offset the lower anticipated investment income earned on invested premiums. conversely, as interest rates rise, pricing targets will tend to decrease to reflect higher anticipated investment income. our ability to effectively react to such changes in interest rates may affect our competitiveness in the marketplace, and in turn, could reduce written premium and earnings.
in addition, due to the long-term nature of the liabilities within our group benefits operations, particularly for long-term disability, declines in interest rates over an extended period of time would result in our having to reinvest at lower yields. on the other hand, a rise in interest rates, in the absence of other countervailing changes, would reduce the market value of our investment portfolio. a decline in market value of invested assets due to an increase in interest rates could also limit our ability to realize tax benefits from previously recognized capital losses.
17
part i - item 1a. risk factors
•   inflation risk - inflation is a risk to our property and casualty business because, in many cases, claims are paid out many years after a policy is written and premium is collected for the risk. accordingly, a greater than expected increase in inflation related to the cost of medical services and repairs over the claim settlement period can result in higher claim costs than what was estimated at the time the policy was written. inflation can also affect consumer spending and business investment which can reduce the demand for our products and services.
concentration of our investment portfolio increases the potential for significant losses.
the concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular industry, collateral type, group of related industries or geographic sector could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolios and consequently on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. events or developments that have a negative impact on any particular industry, collateral type, group of related industries or geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on our investment portfolio to the extent that the portfolio is concentrated rather than diversified.
further, if issuers of securities or loans we hold are acquired, merge or otherwise consolidate with other issuers of securities or loans held by the company, our investment portfolio's credit concentration risk to issuers could increase for a period of time, until the company is able to sell securities to get back in compliance with the established investment credit policies.
insurance industry and product related risks unfavorable loss development may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
we establish property and casualty loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for the payment of all unpaid losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on our policies. loss reserves are estimates of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost, less what has been paid to date. these estimates are based upon actuarial projections and on our assessment of currently available data, as well as estimates of claims severity and frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors.
loss reserve estimates are refined periodically as experience develops and claims are reported and settled, potentially resulting in increases to our reserves. increases in reserves would be recognized as an expense during the periods in which these determinations are made, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations for those periods. in addition, since reserve estimates of aggregate loss costs for prior years are used in pricing our insurance products, inaccurate reserves can lead to our products not being priced adequately to cover actual losses and related loss expenses in order to generate a profit.
we continue to receive asbestos and environmental ("a&e")claims, the vast majority of which relate to policies written before 1986. estimating the ultimate gross reserves needed for unpaid losses and related expenses for asbestos and environmental claims is particularly difficult for insurers and reinsurers. the actuarial tools and other techniques used to estimate the ultimate cost of more traditional insurance exposures tend to be less precise when used to estimate reserves for some a&e exposures.
moreover, the assumptions used to estimate gross reserves for a&e claims, such as claim frequency over time, average severity, and how various policy provisions will be interpreted, are subject to significant uncertainty. it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their effect on the future development of a&e claims. these factors, among others, make the variability of gross reserves estimates for these longer-tailed exposures significantly greater than for other more traditional exposures.
effective december 31, 2016, the company entered into an agreement with national indemnity company ("nico"), a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway inc. ("berkshire") whereby the company is reinsured for subsequent adverse development on substantially all of its net a&e reserves up to an aggregate net limit of $1.5 billion. the adverse development cover excludes risk of adverse development on net a&e reserves held by the company's u.k. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries which have been accounted for as liabilities held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2016. we remain directly liable to claimants and if the reinsurer does not fulfill its obligations under the agreement or if future adverse development exceeds the $1.5 billion aggregate limit, we may need to increase our recorded net reserves which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. for additional information related to risks associated with the adverse development cover, see note 8 - reinsurance and note 14 - commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements.
we are vulnerable to losses from catastrophes, both natural and man-made.
our insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes. catastrophes can be caused by various unpredictable natural events, including, among others, earthquakes, hurricanes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, wind storms, fires, tornadoes, and pandemics. catastrophes can also be man-made, such as terrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, explosions or infrastructure failures.
the geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe exposure for events occurring in a number of areas, including, but not limited to: hurricanes in florida, the gulf coast, the northeast and the atlantic coast regions of the united states; tornadoes and hail in the midwest and southeast; earthquakes in geographical regions exposed to seismic activity; wildfires in the west and the spread of disease. any increases in the values and concentrations of insured employees and property in these areas would increase the severity of catastrophic events in the future. in addition, over time, climate change may increase the severity of certain natural catastrophe events. potential examples include, but are not limited to:
•   an increase in the frequency or severity of wind and thunderstorm and tornado/hailstorm events due to increased convection in the atmosphere,
•   more frequent wildfires in certain geographies,
18
part i - item 1a. risk factors
•   higher incidence of deluge flooding, and
•   the potential for an increase in severity of the largest hurricane events due to higher sea surface temperatures.
our businesses also have exposure to global or nationally occurring pandemics caused by highly infectious and potentially fatal diseases spread through human, animal or plant populations.
in the event of one or more catastrophes, policyholders may be unable to meet their obligations to pay premiums on our insurance policies. further, our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which could result in extraordinary losses. in addition, in part because accounting rules do not permit insurers to reserve for such catastrophic events until they occur, claims from catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. the amount we charge for catastrophe exposure may be inadequate if the frequency or severity of catastrophe losses changes over time or if the models we use to estimate the exposure prove inadequate. in addition, regulators or legislators could limit our ability to charge adequate pricing for catastrophe exposures or shift more responsibility for covering risk.
terrorism is an example of a significant man-made caused potential catastrophe. private sector catastrophe reinsurance is limited and generally unavailable for terrorism losses caused by attacks with nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons. reinsurance coverage from the federal government under the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of 2015 ("tripra") is also limited and only applies for certified acts of terrorism that exceed a certain threshold of industry losses. accordingly, the effects of a terrorist attack in the geographic areas we serve may result in claims and related losses for which we do not have adequate reinsurance. further, the continued threat of terrorism and the occurrence of terrorist attacks, as well as heightened security measures and military action in response to these threats and attacks or other geopolitical or military crises, may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. these consequences could have an adverse effect on the value of the assets in our investment portfolio as well as those in our separate accounts. terrorist attacks also could disrupt our operation centers. for a further discussion of tripra, see part ii, item 7, md&a - enterprise risk management - insurance risk management, reinsurance as a risk management strategy.
as a result, it is possible that any, or a combination of all, of these factors related to a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, whether natural or man-made, can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
pricing for our products is subject to our ability to adequately assess risks, estimate losses and comply with state insurance regulations.
we seek to price our property and casualty and group benefits insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will provide for an acceptable profit in excess of underwriting expenses and the cost of paying claims. pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future claim costs, our expense levels, net investment income realized, our response to rate actions taken by competitors, legal and regulatory developments, and the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes.
state insurance departments regulate many of the premium rates we charge and also propose rate changes for the benefit of the property and casualty consumer at the expense of the insurer, which may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability. in addition to regulating rates, certain states have enacted laws that require a property and casualty insurer to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities, joint underwriting associations and other residual market plans. state regulators also require that an insurer offer property and casualty coverage to all consumers and often restrict an insurer's ability to charge the price it might otherwise charge or restrict an insurer's ability to offer or enforce specific policy deductibles. in these markets, we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower than desired rates or accept additional risk not contemplated in our existing rates, participate in the operating losses of residual market plans or pay assessments to fund operating deficits of state-sponsored funds, possibly leading to lower returns on equity. the laws and regulations of many states also limit an insurer's ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state's insurance department. additionally, certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies. these funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state. any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
additionally, the property and casualty and group benefits insurance markets have been historically cyclical, experiencing periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards, more expansive coverage offerings, multi-year rate guarantees and declining premium rates, followed by periods of relatively low levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards, more coverage restrictions and increasing premium rates. in all of our property and casualty and group benefits insurance product lines and states, there is a risk that the premium we charge may ultimately prove to be inadequate as reported losses emerge. in addition, there is a risk that regulatory constraints, price competition or incorrect pricing assumptions could prevent us from achieving targeted returns. inadequate pricing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
competitive activity, use of data analytics, or technological changes may adversely affect our market share, demand for our products, or our financial results.
the industries in which we operate are highly competitive. our principal competitors are other property and casualty insurers, group benefits providers and providers of mutual funds and exchange-traded products. competitors may expand their risk appetites in products and services where the hartford currently enjoys a competitive advantage. larger competitors with more capital and new entrants to the market could result in increased pricing pressures on a number of our products and services and may harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability. for
19
part i - item 1a. risk factors example, larger competitors, including those formed through consolidation, may have lower operating costs and an ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining their financial strength ratings, thereby allowing them to price their products more competitively. in addition, a number of insurers are making use of "big data" analytics to, among other things, improve pricing accuracy, be more targeted in marketing, strengthen customer relationships and provide more customized loss prevention services. if they are able to use big data more effectively than we are, it may give them a competitive advantage. because of the highly competitive nature of the industries we compete in, there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
our business could also be affected by technological changes, including further advancements in automotive safety features, the development of autonomous or "self-driving" vehicles, and platforms that facilitate ride sharing. these technologies could impact the frequency or severity of losses, disrupt the demand for certain of our products, or reduce the size of the automobile insurance market as a whole. in addition, the risks we insure are affected by the increased use of technology in homes and businesses, including technology used in heating, ventilation, air conditioning and security systems and the introduction of more automated loss control measures. while there is substantial uncertainty about the timing, penetration and reliability of such technologies, and the legal frameworks that may apply, such as for example to autonomous vehicles, any such impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
we may experience difficulty in marketing and providing insurance products and investment advisory services through distribution channels and advisory firms.
we distribute our insurance products, mutual funds and exchange traded products (etps) through a variety of distribution channels and financial intermediaries, including brokers, independent agents, broker-dealers, banks, registered investment advisors, affinity partners, our own internal sales force and other third-party organizations. in some areas of our business, we generate a significant portion of our business through third-party arrangements. for example, we market personal lines products in large part through an exclusive licensing arrangement with aarp that continues through january 1, 2023. our ability to distribute products through the aarp program may be adversely impacted by membership levels and the pace of membership growth. in addition, the independent agent and broker distribution channel is consolidating which could result in a larger proportion of written premium being concentrated among fewer agents and brokers, potentially increasing our cost of acquiring new business. while we periodically seek to renew or extend third party arrangements, there can be no assurance that our relationship with these third parties will continue or that the economics of these relationships won't change to make them less financially attractive to the company. an interruption in our relationship with certain of these third parties could materially affect our ability to market our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
unexpected and unintended claim and coverage issues under our insurance contracts may adversely impact our financial performance.
changes in industry practices and in legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions, technological advances or fraudulent activities, may require us to pay claims we did not intend to cover when we wrote the policies. these issues may either extend coverage beyond our underwriting intent or increase the frequency or severity of claims. in some instances, these changes, advances or activities may not become apparent until some time after we have issued insurance contracts that are affected by the changes, advances or activities. as a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued, and this liability may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity at the time it becomes known.
financial strength, credit and counterparty risks downgrades in our financial strength or credit ratings may make our products less attractive, increase our cost of capital and inhibit our ability to refinance our debt.
financial strength and credit ratings are important in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors. while most of the factors relate to the rated company, others relate to the views of the rating agency (including its assessment of the strategic importance of the rated company to the insurance group), general economic conditions, and circumstances outside the rated company's control. in addition, rating agencies may employ different models and formulas to assess the financial strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating agencies have altered these models. changes to the models or factors used by the rating agencies to assign ratings could adversely impact a rating agency's judgment of its internal rating and the publicly issued rating it assigns us.
our financial strength ratings, which are intended to measure our ability to meet policyholder obligations, are an important factor affecting public confidence in most of our products and, as a result, our competitiveness. a downgrade or a potential downgrade in the rating of our financial strength or of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our competitive position and reduce future sales of our products.
our credit ratings also affect our cost of capital. a downgrade or a potential downgrade of our credit ratings could make it more difficult or costly to refinance maturing debt obligations, to support business growth at our insurance subsidiaries and to maintain or improve the financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries. these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. for a further discussion of potential impacts of ratings

part i - item 1a. risk factors downgrades on derivative instruments, including potential collateral calls, see part ii, item 7, md&a - capital resources and liquidity - derivative commitments.
the amount of statutory capital that we must hold to maintain our financial strength and credit ratings and meet other requirements can vary significantly from time to time and is sensitive to a number of factors outside of our control.
we conduct the vast majority of our business through licensed insurance company subsidiaries. statutory accounting standards and statutory capital and reserve requirements for these entities are prescribed by the applicable insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners ("naic"). the minimum capital we must hold is based on risk-based capital ("rbc") formulas for both life and property and casualty companies. the rbc formula for life companies is applicable to our group benefits business and establishes capital requirements relating to insurance, business, asset, credit, interest rate and off-balance sheet risks. the rbc formula for property and casualty companies sets required statutory surplus levels based on underwriting, asset, credit and off-balance sheet risks.
in any particular year, statutory surplus amounts and rbc ratios may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors, including
•   the amount of statutory income or losses generated by our insurance subsidiaries,
•   the amount of additional capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support business growth,
•   the amount of dividends or distributions taken out of our insurance subsidiaries,
•   changes in equity market levels,
•   the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio,
•   the value of certain derivative instruments,
•   changes in interest rates,
•   admissibility of deferred tax assets, and
•   changes to the naic rbc formulas.
most of these factors are outside of the company's control. the company's financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by the statutory surplus amounts and rbc ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries. in addition, rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing the amount of statutory capital we must hold in order to maintain our current ratings. projecting statutory capital and the related rbc ratios is complex. if our statutory capital resources are insufficient to maintain a particular rating by one or more rating agencies, we may need to use holding company resources or seek to raise capital through public or private equity or debt financing. if we were not to raise additional capital, either at our discretion or because we were unable to do so, our financial strength and credit ratings might be downgraded by one or more rating agencies.
losses due to nonperformance or defaults by counterparties can have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments, reduce our profitability or sources of liquidity.
we have credit risk with counterparties on investments, derivatives, premiums receivable and reinsurance recoverables. among others, our counterparties include issuers of fixed maturity and equity securities we hold, borrowers of mortgage loans we hold, customers, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts, reinsurers, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries and guarantors. these counterparties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud, government intervention and other reasons. in addition, for exchange-traded derivatives, such as futures, options and "cleared" over-the-counter derivatives, the company is generally exposed to the credit risk of the relevant central counterparty clearing house. defaults by these counterparties on their obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments, business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. additionally, if the underlying assets supporting the structured securities we invest in default on their payment obligations, our securities will incur losses.
the availability of reinsurance and our ability to recover under reinsurance contracts may not be sufficient to protect us against losses.
as an insurer, we frequently use reinsurance to reduce the effect of losses that may arise from, among other things, catastrophes and other risks that can cause unfavorable results of operations. under these reinsurance arrangements, other insurers assume a portion of our losses and related expenses; however, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. consequently, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims, and we are subject to our reinsurers' credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from them. the inability or unwillingness of any reinsurer to meet its financial obligations to us, including the impact of any insolvency or rehabilitation proceedings involving a reinsurer that could affect the company's access to collateral held in trust, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
in addition, should the availability and cost of reinsurance change materially, we may have to pay higher reinsurance costs, accept an increase in our net liability exposure, reduce the amount of business we write, or access to the extent possible other alternatives to reinsurance, such as use of the capital markets. further, due to the inherent uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before reinsurance recoverables will be due, it is possible that future adjustments to the company's reinsurance recoverables, net of the allowance, could be required, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarterly or annual period.
our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations.
the payment of future dividends on our capital stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors, which considers, among
21
part i - item 1a. risk factors other factors, our operating results, overall financial condition, credit-risk considerations and capital requirements, as well as general business and market conditions. our board of directors may only declare such dividends out of funds legally available for such payments. moreover, our common stockholders are subject to the prior dividend rights of any holders of depositary shares representing such preferred stock then outstanding. the terms of our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our capital stock or purchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation payment on such stock, if we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments and the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing.
moreover, as a holding company that is separate and distinct from our insurance subsidiaries, we have no significant business operations of our own. therefore, we rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries and other subsidiaries as the principal source of cash flow to meet our obligations. subsidiary dividends fund payments on our debt securities and the payment of dividends to shareholders on our capital stock. connecticut state laws and certain other jurisdictions in which we operate limit the payment of dividends and require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of dividends above certain levels. dividends paid from our insurance subsidiaries are further dependent on their cash requirements. in addition, in the event of liquidation or reorganization of a subsidiary, prior claims of a subsidiary's creditors may take precedence over the holding company's right to a dividend or distribution from the subsidiary except to the extent that the holding company may be a creditor of that subsidiary. for further discussion on dividends from insurance subsidiaries, see part ii, item 7, md&a - capital resources & liquidity.
risks relating to estimates, assumptions and valuations actual results could materially differ from the analytical models we use to assist our decision making in key areas such as underwriting, capital, hedging, reserving, and catastrophe risks.
we use models to help make decisions related to, among other things, underwriting, pricing, capital allocation, reserving, investments, hedging, reinsurance, and catastrophe risk. both proprietary and third party models we use incorporate numerous assumptions and forecasts about the future level and variability of interest rates, capital requirements, loss frequency and severity, currency exchange rates, policyholder behavior, equity markets and inflation, among others. the models are subject to the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis as the historical internal and industry data and assumptions used in the models may not be indicative of what will happen in the future. consequently, actual results may differ materially from our modeled results. the profitability and financial condition of the company substantially depends on the extent to which our actual experience is consistent with assumptions we use in our models and ultimate model outputs. if, based upon these models or other factors, we misprice our products or our estimates of the risks we are exposed to prove to be materially inaccurate, our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity may be adversely affected.
the valuation of our securities and investments and the determination of allowances and impairments are highly subjective and based on methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and market conditions.
estimated fair values of the company's investments are based on available market information and judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. during periods of market disruption, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the financial environment. in addition, there may be certain securities whose fair value is based on one or more unobservable inputs, even during normal market conditions. as a result, the determination of the fair values of these securities may include inputs and assumptions that require more estimation and management judgment and the use of complex valuation methodologies. these fair values may differ materially from the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. further, rapidly changing or unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. decreases in value could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
similarly, management's decision on whether to record an other-than-temporary impairment or write down is subject to significant judgments and assumptions regarding changes in general economic conditions, the issuer's financial condition or future recovery prospects, estimated future cash flows, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads, the expected recovery period and the accuracy of third party information used in internal assessments. as a result, management's evaluations and assessments are highly judgmental and its projections of future cash flows over the life of certain securities may ultimately prove incorrect as facts and circumstances change.
if our businesses do not perform well, we may be required to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset or to recognize an impairment of our goodwill.
our income tax expense includes deferred income taxes arising from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and carry-forwards for foreign tax credits, capital losses and net operating losses. deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized. factors in management's determination include the performance of the business, including the ability to generate, from a variety of sources and tax planning strategies, sufficient
22
part i - item 1a. risk factors future taxable income and capital gains before net operating loss and capital loss carry-forwards expire. if based on available information, it is more likely than not that we are unable to recognize a full tax benefit on deferred tax assets, then a valuation allowance will be established with a corresponding charge to net income (loss). charges to increase our valuation allowance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
goodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. we test goodwill at least annually for impairment. impairment testing is performed based upon estimates of the fair value of the "reporting unit" to which the goodwill relates. the reporting unit is the operating segment or a business one level below an operating segment if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level. the fair value of the reporting unit could decrease if new business, customer retention, profitability or other drivers of performance differ from expectations. if it is determined that the goodwill has been impaired, the company must write down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income (loss). these write downs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
strategic and operational risks our businesses may suffer and we may incur substantial costs if we are unable to access our systems and safeguard the security of our data in the event of a disaster, cyber breach or other information security incident.
we use technology to process, store, retrieve, evaluate and utilize customer and company data and information. our information technology and telecommunications systems, in turn, interface with and rely upon third-party systems. we and our third party vendors must be able to access our systems to provide insurance quotes, process premium payments, make changes to existing policies, file and pay claims, administer mutual funds, provide customer support, manage our investment portfolios and hedge programs, report on financial results and perform other necessary business functions.
systems failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform these business functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers. in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, a pandemic, an industrial accident, a cyber-attack, a blackout, a terrorist attack (including conventional, nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological) or war, systems upon which we rely may be inaccessible to our employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time. even if our employees and business partners are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems used to conduct our business are disabled or destroyed.
our systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access, cyber-
attacks or other computer related penetrations. the frequency and sophistication of such threats continue to increase as well. while, to date, the hartford is not aware of having experienced a material breach of our cyber security systems, administrative and technical controls as well as other preventive actions may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, denial of service, cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our systems or those of third parties with whom we do business. such an event could compromise our confidential information as well as that of our clients and third parties, impede or interrupt our business operations and result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenue, additional regulatory scrutiny and litigation and reputational damage. in addition, we routinely transmit to third parties personal, confidential and proprietary information, which may be related to employees and customers, by email and other electronic means, along with receiving and storing such information on our systems. although we attempt to protect privileged and confidential information, we may be unable to secure the information in all events, especially with clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties who may not have appropriate controls to protect confidential information.
our businesses must comply with regulations to control the privacy of customer, employee and third party data, and state and federal regulations regarding data privacy are becoming increasingly more onerous. a misuse or mishandling of confidential or proprietary information could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm.
third parties, including third party administrators, are also subject to cyber-breaches of confidential information, along with the other risks outlined above, any one of which may result in our incurring substantial costs and other negative consequences, including a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. while we maintain cyber liability insurance that provides both third party liability and first party insurance coverages, our insurance may not be sufficient to protect against all loss.
performance problems due to outsourcing and other third-party relationships may compromise our ability to conduct business.
we outsource certain business and administrative functions and rely on third-party vendors to perform certain functions or provide certain services on our behalf and have a significant number of information technology and business processes outsourced with a single vendor. if we are unable to reach agreement in the negotiation of contracts or renewals with certain third-party providers, or if such third-party providers experience disruptions or do not perform as anticipated, we may be unable to meet our obligations to customers and claimants, incur higher costs and lose business which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. for other risks associated with our outsourcing of certain functions, see the immediately preceding risk factor.
23
part i - item 1a. risk factors our ability to execute on capital management plans, expense reduction initiatives and other actions, which may include acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings, is subject to material challenges, uncertainties and risks.
the ability to execute on capital management plans is subject to material challenges, uncertainties and risks. from time to time, our capital management plans may include the repurchase of common stock, the paydown of outstanding debt or both. we may not achieve all of the benefits we expect to derive from these plans. while we currently do not have an equity repurchase plan approved for 2018, any such capital management plan would be subject to execution risks, including, among others, risks related to market fluctuations, investor interest and potential legal constraints that could delay execution at an otherwise optimal time. there can be no assurance that we will fully execute any such plan. in addition, we may not be successful in keeping our ongoing businesses cost efficient. in particular, the company may not be able to achieve all the expense synergies it expects to get as a result of acquiring aetna's u.s. group life and disability business which could adversely affect the profitability of the group benefits segment. we may take future actions, including acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings, that may involve additional uncertainties and risks that negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims.
we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. although we use a broad range of measures to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. we may have to litigate to enforce and protect our intellectual property and to determine its scope, validity or enforceability, which could divert significant resources and may not prove successful. litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights may not be successful and cost a significant amount of money. the inability to secure or enforce the protection of our intellectual property assets could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete. we also may be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges our operations or activities infringe upon their intellectual property rights, including patent rights, or violate license usage rights. any such intellectual property claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant expense and liability for damages, and in some circumstances we could be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers, or utilizing and benefiting from certain patent, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses, or alternatively could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
regulatory and legal risks regulatory and legislative developments could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
in the u.s., regulatory initiatives and legislative developments may significantly affect our operations and prospects in ways that we cannot predict.
for example, the impact of the elimination of the individual mandate of the affordable care act and potential modification of the dodd-frank act could have unanticipated consequences for the company and its businesses. with respect to the impact of the elimination of the individual mandate of the affordable care act, see part ii, item 7, md&a - capital resources and liquidity - contingencies - regulatory and legal developments.
the dodd-frank act was enacted on july 21, 2010, mandating changes to the regulation of the financial services industry that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. the dodd-frank act requires central clearing of certain derivatives transactions and greater margin requirements for those transactions, which increases the costs of hedging. in addition, the proprietary trading and market making limitation of the volcker rule could adversely affect the pricing and liquidity of our investment securities and limitations of banking entity involvement in and ownership of certain asset-backed securities transactions could adversely affect the market for insurance-linked securities, including catastrophe bonds. it is unclear whether and to what extent congress will make changes to the dodd-frank act, and how those changes might impact the company, its business, financial conditions, results of operations and liquidity.
we are subject to extensive laws and regulations that are complex, subject to change and often conflicting in their approach or intended outcomes. compliance with these laws and regulations can increase cost, affect our strategy, and constrain our ability to adequately price our products.
our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled, licensed or authorized to conduct business. state regulations generally seek to protect the interests of policyholders rather than an insurer or the insurer's shareholders and other investors. u.s. state laws grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things, licensing and authorizing lines of business, approving policy forms and premium rates, setting statutory capital and reserve requirements, limiting the types and amounts of certain investments and restricting underwriting practices. state insurance departments also set constraints on domestic insurer transactions with affiliates and dividends and, in many cases, must approve affiliate transactions and extraordinary dividends as well as strategic transactions such as acquisitions and divestitures.
in addition, future regulatory initiatives could be adopted at the federal or state level that could impact the profitability of our businesses. for example, the naic and state insurance regulators
24
part i - item 1a. risk factors are continually reexamining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on modifications to statutory accounting principles, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws and regulations. the naic continues to enhance the u.s. system of insurance solvency regulation, with a particular focus on group supervision, risk-based capital, accounting and financial reporting, enterprise risk management and reinsurance. any proposed or future legislation or naic initiatives, if adopted, may be more restrictive on our ability to conduct business than current regulatory requirements or may result in higher costs or increased statutory capital and reserve requirements. in addition, the federal reserve board and the international association of insurance supervisors ("iais") each have initiatives underway to develop insurance group capital standards. while the company would not currently be subject to either of these capital standard regimes, it is possible that in the future standards similar to what is being contemplated by the federal reserve board or the iais could apply to the company. the naic is in the process of developing a u.s. group capital calculation that will employ a methodology based on aggregated risk-based capital.
further, a particular regulator or enforcement authority may interpret a legal, accounting, or reserving issue differently than we have, exposing us to different or additional regulatory risks. the application of these regulations and guidelines by insurers involves interpretations and judgments that may be challenged by state insurance departments. the result of those potential challenges could require us to increase levels of statutory capital and reserves or incur higher operating and/or tax costs.
in addition, our asset management businesses are also subject to extensive regulation in the various jurisdictions where they operate.. these laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets or investment advisory clients and generally grant supervisory authorities broad administrative powers. compliance with these laws and regulations is costly, time consuming and personnel intensive, and may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
our insurance business is sensitive to significant changes in the legal environment that could adversely affect the hartford's results of operations or financial condition or harm its businesses.
like any major p&c insurance company, litigation is a routine part of the hartford's business - both in defending and indemnifying our insureds and in litigating insurance coverage disputes. the hartford accounts for such activity by establishing unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. significant changes in the legal environment could cause our ultimate liabilities to change from our current expectations. such changes could be judicial in nature, like trends in the size of jury awards, developments in the law relating to tort liability or the liability of insurers, and rulings concerning the scope of insurance coverage or the amount or types of damages covered by insurance. legislative developments, like changes in federal or state laws relating to the liability of policyholders or insurers, could have a similar effect. it is impossible to forecast such changes reliably, much less to predict how they might affect our loss reserves or how those changes might adversely affect our ability to price our insurance products appropriately. thus, significant judicial or legislative developments could adversely affect the hartford's business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
changes in federal or state tax laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
changes in federal or state tax laws and tax rates or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition. for example, the recent reduction in tax rates due to the tax cuts and jobs act reduced our deferred tax assets resulting in a charge against earnings. a reduction in tax rates or change in laws could adversely affect the company's ability to realize the benefits of its net operating loss carryovers and alternative minimum tax credits.
in addition, the company's tax return reflects certain items such as tax-exempt bond interest, tax credits, and insurance reserve deductions. there is an increasing risk that, in the context of deficit reduction or overall tax reform, federal and/or state tax legislation could modify or eliminate these items, impacting the company, its investments, investment strategies, and/or its policyholders. in the context of deficit reduction or overall tax reform, federal and/or state tax legislation could modify or eliminate provisions of current tax law that are beneficial to the company, including tax-exempt bond interest, tax credits, and insurance reserve deductions, or could impose new taxes such as on goods or services purchased overseas.
on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the "tax cuts and jobs act" ("tax reform"). tax reform reduced the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. it also eliminated the corporate alternative minimum tax (amt) and changed how existing amt credits can be realized. certain provisions in the law are intended to increase insurance companies' taxable earnings. the new method for discounting property and casualty loss reserves for tax purposes decreases the amount of incurred losses that are currently deductible, delaying the timing of when incurred losses may be deducted. the effect of the difference on the december 31, 2017 tax basis reserve between discounting under the existing method and the new method will be included in taxable income ratably over the next 8 years. in addition, new limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation and limitations on net operating losses (nols) generated after december 31, 2017 will also increase the taxable income base. the exact impacts of many of the provisions will not be fully known until treasury and the irs provide clarification by issuing rules, regulations and advice. furthermore, congress may enact a technical corrections bill or other legislation that could affect how provisions of the act apply to the hartford. in response to the recent changes in the federal tax law, we could see states enact changes to their tax laws which, in turn, could affect the company negatively. among other risks, there is risk that these additional clarifications could increase the taxes on the company, further increase administrative costs, make the sale of our products more costly and/or make our products less competitive.
while the company expects a benefit to earnings from lower corporate federal income tax rates in 2018, there is uncertainty about how insurance carriers will adjust their product pricing, if at all, going forward. if the company reduces its pricing in response to competition or to state regulatory action, product price
25
part i - item 1a. risk factors reductions could serve to reduce, or even eliminate, the benefit of lower corporate federal tax rates in periods after 2018.
regulatory requirements could delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider in their best interests.
before a person can acquire control of a u.s. insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where the domestic insurer is domiciled. prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer, the state insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant, the acquirer's plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer, and any such additional information as the insurance commissioner may deem necessary or appropriate for the protection of policyholders or in the public interest. generally, state statutes provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10 percent or more of the voting securities of the domestic insurer or its parent company. because a person acquiring 10 percent or more of our common stock would indirectly control the same percentage of the stock of our u.s. insurance subsidiaries, the insurance change of control laws of various u.s. jurisdictions would likely apply to such a transaction. other laws or required approvals pertaining to one or more of our existing subsidiaries, or a future subsidiary, may contain similar or additional restrictions on the acquisition of control of the company. these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter, or prevent a change of control, including transactions that our board of directors and some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable.
changes in accounting principles and financial reporting requirements could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.
as an sec registrant, we are currently required to prepare our financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap, as promulgated by the financial accounting standards board ("fasb"). accordingly, we are required to adopt new guidance or interpretations which may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition that is either unexpected or has a greater impact than expected. for a description of changes in accounting standards that are currently pending and, if known, our estimates of their expected impact, see note 1 of the consolidated financial statements.
risks relating to the pending sale of our life and annuity business the closing of the sale of our life and annuity run-off business is subject to risks and uncertainties.
on december 4, 2017, the company announced the sale of its life and annuity run-off business to hopmeadow acquisition, inc.
("buyer") whereby a subsidiary of the company will sell all of the issued and outstanding equity of hartford life, inc. ("hli") to buyer. the sale is expected to close by june 30, 2018.
the closing of the sale is subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions, many of which are beyond the company's control. the company cannot predict with certainty whether all of the required closing conditions will be satisfied or waived or if other uncertainties may arise. in addition, regulators could impose additional requirements or obligations as conditions for their approvals, which may be burdensome. as a result, the sale may not be completed or may be delayed and the company may lose some or all of the intended benefits of the sale.
the assets and liabilities of the life and annuity run-off business, consisting primarily of the operations of hartford life insurance company and hartford life and annuity insurance company (formerly known as talcott resolution), have been accounted for as held for sale as of december 31, 2017, with the operating results of that business included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, apart from interest expense on hli debt and certain tax benefits retained by the company, results from the discontinued operations inure to the buyer. accordingly, any earnings or losses of the life and annuity run-off business up until closing will not change the company's results.
should the transaction not close, the company would retain and continue to bear the risks inherent in this businesses and, thus, its operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected by those risks.
the investment portfolio and insurance liabilities of the company's life and annuity business included in discontinued operations are sensitive to changes in economic, political and global capital market conditions, such as the effect of a weak economy and changes in credit spreads, equity prices, interest rates and inflation.
in addition to credit exposure in the life and annuity business investment portfolio, the statutory surplus of the life and annuity business is also affected by widening credit spreads as a result of the accounting for the assets and liabilities on fixed market value adjusted ("mva") annuities. statutory separate account assets supporting the fixed mva annuities are recorded at fair value. in determining the statutory reserve for the fixed mva annuity payments owed to contract-holders, current crediting rates are used. in many capital market scenarios, current crediting rates are highly correlated with market rates implicit in the fair value of statutory separate account assets. as a result, the change in the statutory reserve from period to period will likely substantially offset the change in the fair value of the statutory separate account assets. however, in periods of volatile credit markets, actual credit spreads on investment assets may increase sharply for certain sub-sectors of the overall credit market, resulting in statutory separate account asset market value losses. as actual credit spreads are not fully reflected in current crediting rates, the calculation of statutory reserves may not substantially offset the change in fair value of the statutory separate account assets, resulting in reductions in statutory surplus. this may result in the need to devote significant additional capital to support the fixed mva product.
26
part i - item 1a. risk factors a decline in equity markets may result in lower earnings from the life and annuity business where fee income is earned based upon the fair value of the assets under management. in addition, certain annuity products have guaranteed minimum death benefits ("gmdb") or guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits ("gmwb") that increase when equity markets decline requiring more statutory capital to be held. while hedging programs are used to reduce the net economic sensitivity of our potential obligations from guaranteed benefits due to market fluctuations, rising equity markets and/or rising interest rates may nevertheless result in statutory or gaap losses because of accounting asymmetries between hedging targets and statutory and gaap accounting principles for the guaranteed benefits.
a low interest rate environment puts pressure on net investment income and could result in lower margins and lower estimated gross profits on certain annuity products included in discontinued operations.
a rise in interest rates, in the absence of other countervailing changes, would reduce the market value of the life and annuity business investment portfolio and, if long-term interest rates were to rise dramatically, certain products within that business might be exposed to disintermediation risk. disintermediation risk refers to the risk that policyholders may surrender their contracts in a rising interest rate environment, requiring the liquidation of assets in an unrealized loss position.
some of the in-force variable annuity contracts included in discontinued operations offer guaranteed benefits, including gmdbs and gmwbs. these gmbds and gmwbs are exposed to interest rate risk and significant equity risk. a decline in equity markets would not only result in lower fee income, but would also increase the company's exposure to liability for benefit claims. reinsurance and benefit designs, such as caps, are used to mitigate the exposure associated with gmdb. to minimize the claim exposure and to reduce the volatility of net income associated with the gmwb liability, reinsurance is used in combination with product management actions, such as rider fee increases, investment restrictions and buyout offers, as well as derivative instruments. the contract issuer remains liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that reinsurers or derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay, which could result in a need for additional capital to support in-force business.
from time to time, the risk management program may be adjusted based on contracts in force, market conditions, or other factors. while these actions may improve the efficiency of our risk management efforts related to these benefits, changes to the risk management program may result in greater statutory and gaap earnings volatility and, based upon the types of hedging instruments used, can result in potentially material changes to net income (loss) in periods of rising equity market pricing levels, higher interest rates and declines in volatility. the life and annuity run-off business is also subject to the risk that these management actions prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior, combined with adverse market events, produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed, which individually or collectively may have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of the discontinued operations.
the minimum capital that must be held by the life and annuity companies is based on risk-based capital ("rbc") formulas for life companies. the rbc formula for life companies establishes capital requirements relating to insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks, including equity, interest rate and expense recovery risks associated with variable annuities and group annuities that contain death benefits or certain withdrawal benefits.
in extreme scenarios of equity market declines and other capital market volatility, the amount of additional statutory reserves that must be held for variable annuity guarantees increases at a greater than linear rate. this reduces the statutory surplus used in calculating rbc ratios. when equity markets increase, surplus levels and rbc ratios would generally be expected to increase. however, as a result of a number of factors and market conditions, including the level of hedging costs and other risk transfer activities, statutory reserve requirements for death and withdrawal benefit guarantees and increases in rbc requirements, surplus and rbc ratios may not increase when equity markets increase. due to these factors, projecting statutory capital and the related rbc ratios is complex.
the investment portfolio of the life and annuity business included in discontinued operations is also exposed to losses due to nonperformance or defaults by counterparties. for example, if the counterparties to the underlying assets supporting the structured securities we invest in default on their payment obligations, the securities held will incur losses.
while a portion of contracts with gmwb riders are reinsured and the majority of gmdb contracts with net amount at risk are reinsured, the insurers that wrote the contracts remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. the inability or unwillingness of any reinsurer to meet its financial obligations, including the impact of any insolvency or rehabilitation proceedings involving a reinsurer, could affect the life and annuity companies' access to collateral held in trust. this risk may be magnified by a concentration of reinsurance-related credit risk resulting from the sale of the individual life and retirement products businesses in 2013 though that business is part of the talcott resolution operations being sold to the buyer.
life and annuity products also contain risks relating to estimates, assumptions and valuations. if assumptions used in estimating future gross profits differ from actual experience, it may accelerate the amortization of deferred acquisition costs ("dac") and increase reserves for gmdb and gmwb on variable annuities.
deferred acquisition costs for the variable annuity products included in discontinued operations are amortized over the expected life of the contracts. the remaining deferred but not yet amortized cost is referred to as the dac asset. these costs are amortized based on the ratio of actual gross profits in the period to the present value of current and future estimated gross profits ("egps"). egp's are used to determine if a dac impairment exists. certain reserves for gmdb and the life contingent portion of gmwb are valued using components of egps. the projection of egps, or components of egps, requires the use of certain assumptions that may not prove accurate, including those related to changes in the separate account fund returns, full or partial surrender rates, mortality, withdrawal benefit utilization, withdrawal rates, annuitization and hedging costs.
in addition, if assumptions about policyholder behavior (e.g., full or partial surrenders, benefit utilization and annuitization) and costs related to mitigating risks, including hedging costs, prove to
27
part i - item 1a. risk factors be inaccurate or if significant or sustained equity market declines occur, there could be a further acceleration of dac amortization related to variable annuity contracts, and increased reserves for gmdb and life-contingent gmwb.
as noted above, the 2017 tax reform reduced the value of net deferred tax assets, including net deferred tax assets to be transferred to the buyer. provisions included in the tax reform legislation further limited the corporate dividends received deduction and there is a risk that congress could further reduce or eliminate the corporate dividends received deduction altogether.
the 2017 tax reform legislation also changed the formula for calculating life insurance reserves, the effect of which is to reduce the amount of tax deductible life insurance reserves. the 2017 tax reform provided that the amount of that difference be included in income ratably over an eight year period. in addition, the 2017 tax reform legislation increased the amount of acquisition expenses that are required to be amortized and lengthened the period of time to fifteen years over which these deferred expenses can be amortized. both provisions were intended to increase a life insurer's taxable income base.
moreover, many of the life and annuity products included in discontinued operations benefit from one or more forms of tax-favored status under current federal and state income tax regimes. for example, some of the annuity contracts previously sold, allowed policyholders to defer the recognition of taxable income earned within the contract. if, however, the tax treatment of earnings accrued inside an annuity contract changed prospectively, and the tax favored status of existing contracts was grandfathered, holders of existing contracts would be less likely to surrender their annuity contracts.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
(dollar amounts in millions, except for per share data, unless otherwise stated)
the hartford provides projections and other forward-looking information in the following discussions, which contain many forward-looking statements, particularly relating to the company's future financial performance. these forward-looking statements are estimates based on information currently available to the company, are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and are subject to the cautionary statements set forth on pages 4 and 5 of this form 10-k. actual results are likely to differ, and in the past have differed, materially from those forecast by the company, depending on the outcome of various factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in the following discussion and in part i, item 1a, risk factors, and those identified from time to time in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission. the hartford undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.
on december 3, 2017, hartford holdings, inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, entered into a definitive agreement to sell all of the issued and outstanding equity of hartford life, inc. ("hli"), a holding company, and its life and annuity operating subsidiaries. for discussion of this transaction, see note 20 - business dispositions and discontinued operations of notes to consolidated financial statements.
on november 1, 2017, hartford life and accident insurance company ("hla"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, completed the acquisition of aetna's u.s. group life and disability business through a reinsurance transaction. aetna's u.s. group life and disability revenue and earnings since the acquisition date are included in the operating results of the company's group benefits reporting segment. for discussion of this transaction, see note 2 - business acquisitions of notes to consolidated financial statements.
on may 10, 2017, the company completed the sale of its u.k. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries. the operating results of the company's u.k. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries are included in the p&c other operations reporting segment. for discussion of this transaction, see note 20 - business dispositions and discontinued operations of notes to consolidated financial statements.
on july 29, 2016, the company completed the acquisition of maxum specialty insurance group and lattice strategies llc. maxum's revenue and earnings since the acquisition date are included in the operating results of the company's commercial lines reporting segment. lattice's revenue and earnings since the acquisition date are included in the operating results of the company's mutual funds reporting segment. for discussion of these transactions, see note 2 - business acquisitions of notes to consolidated financial statements.
certain reclassifications have been made to historical financial information presented in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") to conform to the current period presentation.
fee income from installment fees reported by the commercial lines and personal lines reporting segments has been reclassified from underwriting expenses to fee income and included in total revenues. the reclassification of installment fees did not impact previously reported underwriting gain (loss), underwriting ratios, or net income (loss) either in the commercial lines or personal lines reporting segments and did not impact previously reported consolidated net income or core earnings.
separately, the flood servicing business has been realigned from specialty commercial within the commercial lines reporting segment to the personal lines reporting segment. this realignment did not materially impact previously reported commercial lines or personal lines underwriting results or net income. the realignment of the flood servicing business did not impact previously reported consolidated net income or core earnings.
assets and liabilities associated with the company's life and annuity run-off business are now classified as held for sale.
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and reinsurance recoverables for structured settlements reserves and recoverables due from the company's life and annuity run-off business now classified as held for sale have been reclassified into the company's p&c commercial lines business. annuities purchased from third-party life insurers under structured settlements, including from life and annuity run-off obligations held for sale, are recognized as reinsurance recoverables in cases where the company has not obtained a release from the claimant. these amounts were previously eliminated in consolidation.
policy loans have been reclassified to other investments on the consolidated balance sheets.
other intangible assets have been reclassified out of other assets on the consolidated balance sheets into their own line item.
likewise, amortization of intangible assets has been reclassified out of insurance operating costs and other expenses on the consolidated statements of operations into their own line item.
the hartford defines increases or decreases greater than or equal to 200% as "nm" or not meaningful.

key performance measures and ratios the company considers the measures and ratios in the following discussion to be key performance indicators for its businesses. management believes that these ratios and measures are useful in understanding the underlying trends in the hartford's businesses. however, these key performance indicators should only be used in conjunction with, and not in lieu of, the results presented in the segment discussions that follow in this md&a. these ratios and measures may not be comparable to other performance measures used by the company's competitors.
definitions of non-gaap and other measures and ratios assets under management ("aum")- include mutual fund and etp assets. aum is a measure used by the company because a significant portion of the company's mutual fund revenues are based upon asset values. these revenues increase or decrease with a rise or fall in aum whether caused by changes in the market or through net flows.
book value per diluted share- excluding aoci, is calculated based upon a non-gaap financial measure. it is calculated by dividing (a) total stockholders' equity, excluding aoci, after tax, by (b) common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares. the company provides this measure to enable investors to analyze the amount of the company's net worth that is primarily attributable to the company's business operations. the company believes it is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, primarily based on changes in interest rates.
catastrophe ratio- (a component of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio) represents the ratio of catastrophe losses incurred in the current calendar year (net of reinsurance) to earned premiums and includes catastrophe losses incurred for both the current and prior accident years. a catastrophe is an event that causes $25 or more in industry insured property losses and affects a significant number of property and casualty policyholders and insurers, as defined by the property claim service office of verisk. the catastrophe ratio includes the effect of catastrophe losses, but does not include the effect of reinstatement premiums.
combined ratio- the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, the expense ratio and the policyholder dividend ratio. this ratio is a relative measurement that describes the related cost of losses and expenses for every $100 of earned premiums. a combined ratio below 100 demonstrates underwriting profit; a combined ratio above 100 demonstrates underwriting losses.
core earnings- a non-gaap measure, is an important measure of the company's operating performance. the company believes that core earnings provides investors with a valuable measure of the underlying performance of the company's businesses because it reveals trends in our insurance and financial services businesses that may be obscured by including the net effect of certain realized capital gains and losses, certain restructuring and other costs, integration and transaction costs in connection with an acquired business, pension settlements, loss on extinguishment of debt, gains and losses on reinsurance transactions, income tax benefit from a reduction in deferred income tax valuation allowance, impact of tax reform on net deferred tax assets, and results of discontinued operations. some realized capital gains and losses are primarily driven by investment decisions and external economic developments, the nature and timing of which are unrelated to the insurance and underwriting aspects of our business. accordingly, core earnings excludes the effect of all realized gains and losses that tend to be variable from period to period based on capital market conditions. the company believes, however, that some realized capital gains and losses are integrally related to our insurance operations, so core earnings includes net realized gains and losses such as net periodic settlements on credit derivatives. these net realized gains and losses are directly related to an offsetting item included in the income statement such as net investment income. net income (loss) is the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measure. core earnings should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the overall profitability of the company's business. therefore, the company believes that it is useful for investors to evaluate both net income (loss) and core earnings when reviewing the company's performance.

[1]   includes income tax benefit on items not included in core earnings and other federal income tax benefits and charges, including an $877 charge in 2017 primarily due to a reduction in net deferred tax assets as a result of the decrease in the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%.
core earnings margin- a non-gaap financial measure that the company uses to evaluate, and believes is an important measure of, the group benefits segment's operating performance. core earnings margin is calculated by dividing core earnings by revenues excluding buyouts and realized gains (losses). net income margin is the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measure. the company believes that core earnings margin provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of group benefits because it reveals trends in the business that may be obscured by the effect of buyouts and realized gains (losses). core earnings margin should not be considered as a substitute for net income margin and does not reflect the overall profitability of group benefits. therefore, the company believes it is important for investors to evaluate both core earnings margin and net income margin when reviewing performance. a reconciliation of net income margin to core earnings margin for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 is set forth in the results of operations section within md&a - group benefits.
expense ratio- for the underwriting segments of commercial lines and personal lines is the ratio of underwriting expenses less fee income, to earned premiums. underwriting expenses include the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and insurance operating costs and expenses, including certain centralized services and bad debt expense. deferred policy acquisition costs include commissions, taxes, licenses and fees and other underwriting expenses and are amortized over the policy term.
the expense ratio for group benefits is expressed as the ratio of insurance operating costs and other expenses including amortization of intangibles and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, to premiums and other considerations, excluding buyout premiums. the expense ratio does not include integration and other transaction costs associated with acquired business.
fee income- largely driven from amounts earned as a result of contractually defined percentages of assets under management. these fees are generally earned on a daily basis. therefore, the growth in assets under management either through positive net flows or favorable market performance will have a favorable impact on fee income. conversely, either negative net flows or unfavorable market performance will reduce fee income.
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio- a measure of the cost of claims incurred in the calendar year divided by earned premium and includes losses incurred for both the current and prior accident years. among other factors, the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio needed for the company to achieve its targeted return on equity fluctuates from year to year based on changes in the expected investment yield over the claim settlement period, the timing of expected claim settlements and the targeted returns set by management based on the competitive environment.
the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is affected by claim frequency and claim severity, particularly for shorter-tail property lines of business, where the emergence of claim frequency and severity is credible and likely indicative of ultimate losses. claim frequency represents the percentage change in the average number of reported claims per unit of exposure in the current accident year compared to that of the previous accident year. claim severity represents the percentage change in the estimated average cost per claim in the current accident year compared to that of the previous accident year. as one of the factors used to determine pricing, the company's practice is to first make an overall assumption about claim frequency and severity for a given line of business and then, as part of the ratemaking process, adjust the assumption as appropriate for the particular state, product or coverage.
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development- a measure of the cost of non-catastrophe claims incurred in the current accident year divided by earned premiums. management believes that the current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes is a performance measure that is useful to investors as it removes the impact of volatile and unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year development.
loss ratio, excluding buyouts- utilized for the group benefits segment and is expressed as a ratio of benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums and other
34
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations considerations, excluding buyout premiums. since group benefits occasionally buys a block of claims for a stated premium amount, the company excludes this buyout from the loss ratio used for evaluating the underwriting results of the business as buyouts may distort the loss ratio. buyout premiums represent takeover of open claim liabilities and other non-recurring premium amounts.
mutual fund and exchange-traded product assets-  are owned by the shareholders of those products and not by the company and therefore are not reflected in the company's consolidated financial statements. mutual fund and etp assets are a measure used by the company primarily because a significant portion of the company's revenues are based upon asset values. these revenues increase or decrease with a rise or fall in aum whether caused by changes in the market or through net flows.
new business written premium- represents the amount of premiums charged for policies issued to customers who were not insured with the company in the previous policy term. new business written premium plus renewal policy written premium equals total written premium.
policies in force- represent the number of policies with coverage in effect as of the end of the period. the number of policies in force is a growth measure used for personal lines and standard commercial lines within commercial lines and is affected by both new business growth and policy count retention.
policy count retention- represents the ratio of the number of policies renewed during the period divided by the number of policies available to renew. the number of policies available to renew represents the number of policies, net of any cancellations, written in the previous policy term. policy count retention is affected by a number of factors, including the percentage of renewal policy quotes accepted and decisions by the company to non-renew policies because of specific policy underwriting concerns or because of a decision to reduce premium writings in certain classes of business or states. policy count retention is also affected by advertising and rate actions taken by competitors.
policyholder dividend ratio- the ratio of policyholder dividends to earned premium.
prior accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio- represents the increase (decrease) in the estimated cost of settling catastrophe and non-catastrophe claims incurred in prior accident years as recorded in the current calendar year divided by earned premiums.
reinstatement premiums- represents additional ceded premium paid for the reinstatement of the amount of reinsurance coverage that was reduced as a result of a reinsurance loss payment.
renewal earned price increase (decrease)- written premiums are earned over the policy term, which is six months for certain personal lines automobile business and twelve months for substantially all of the remainder of the company's property and casualty business. since the company earns premiums over the six to twelve month term of the policies, renewal earned price increases (decreases) lag renewal written price increases (decreases) by six to twelve months.
renewal written price increase (decrease)-for commercial lines, represents the combined effect of rate changes, amount of insurance and individual risk pricing decisions per unit of exposure on policies that renewed. for personal lines, renewal written price increases represent the total change in premium per policy on those policies that renewed and includes the combined effect of rate changes, amount of insurance and other changes in exposure. for personal lines, other changes in exposure include, but are not limited to, the effect of changes in number of drivers, vehicles and incidents, as well as changes in customer policy elections, such as deductibles and limits. the rate component represents the change in rate filed with and approved by state regulators during the period and the amount of insurance represents the change in the value of the rating base, such as model year/vehicle symbol for automobiles, building replacement costs for property and wage inflation for workers' compensation. a number of factors affect renewal written price increases (decreases) including expected loss costs as projected by the company's pricing actuaries, rate filings approved by state regulators, risk selection decisions made by the company's underwriters and marketplace competition. renewal written price changes reflect the property and casualty insurance market cycle. prices tend to increase for a particular line of business when insurance carriers have incurred significant losses in that line of business in the recent past or the industry as a whole commits less of its capital to writing exposures in that line of business. prices tend to decrease when recent loss experience has been favorable or when competition among insurance carriers increases. renewal written price statistics are subject to change from period to period, based on a number of factors, including changes in actuarial estimates and the effect of subsequent cancellations and non-renewals, and modifications made to better reflect ultimate pricing achieved.
return on assets ("roa"), core earnings- a non-gaap financial measure that the company uses to evaluate, and believes is an important measure of the mutual funds segment's operating performance. roa is the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measure. the company believes that roa, core earnings, provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of the mutual funds segment because it reveals trends in our business that may be obscured by the effect of realized gains (losses). roa, core earnings, should not be considered as a substitute for roa and does not reflect the overall profitability of our mutual funds business. therefore, the company believes it is important for investors to evaluate both roa, core earnings, and roa when reviewing the mutual funds segment performance. roa, core earnings is calculated by dividing core earnings by a daily average aum. a reconciliation of roa to roa, core earnings for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, is set forth in the results of operations section within md&a - mutual funds.
underlying combined ratio- a non-gaap financial measure, represents the combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development. combined ratio is the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measure.  the company believes the underlying combined ratio is an important measure of the trend in profitability since it removes the impact of volatile and unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year loss and loss adjustment expense reserve development. a reconciliation of

underwriting gain (loss)- the company's management evaluates profitability of the p&c businesses primarily on the basis of underwriting gain (loss). underwriting gain (loss) is a before-tax measure that represents earned premiums less incurred losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses. underwriting gain (loss) is influenced significantly by earned premium growth and the adequacy of the company's pricing. underwriting profitability over time is also greatly influenced by the company's pricing and underwriting discipline, which seeks to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, its management of claims, its use of reinsurance and its ability to manage its expense ratio, which it accomplishes through economies of scale and its management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses. net income (loss) is the most directly comparable gaap measure. the company believes that underwriting gain (loss) provides investors with a valuable measure of before-tax profitability derived from underwriting activities, which are managed separately from the company's investing activities. a reconciliation of underwriting gain (loss) to net income (loss) for commercial lines, personal lines and property & casualty other operations is set forth in segment sections of md&a.
written and earned premiums- written premium is a statutory accounting financial measure which represents the amount of premiums charged for policies issued, net of reinsurance, during a fiscal period. earned premium is a u.s. gaap and statutory measure. premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial results on a pro rata basis over the policy period. management believes that written premium is a performance measure that is useful to investors as it reflects current trends in the company's sale of property and casualty insurance products. written and earned premium are recorded net of ceded reinsurance premium.
traditional life insurance type products, such as those sold by group benefits, collect premiums from policyholders in exchange for financial protection for the policyholder from a specified insurable loss, such as death or disability. these premiums together with net investment income earned from the overall investment strategy are used to pay the contractual obligations under these insurance contracts. two major factors, new sales and persistency, impact premium growth. sales can increase or decrease in a given year based on a number of factors, including but not limited to, customer demand for the company's product offerings, pricing competition, distribution channels and the company's reputation and ratings. persistency refers to the percentage of policies remaining in-force from year-to-year.
the hartford's operations overview the hartford conducts business principally in five reporting segments including commercial lines, personal lines, property &
casualty other operations, group benefits, and mutual funds, as well as a corporate category. the hartford includes in its corporate category discontinued operations of the company's life and annuity run-off business accounted for as held for sale, reserves for structured settlement and terminal funding agreement liabilities retained, capital raising activities (including debt financing and related interest expense), purchase accounting adjustments related to goodwill and other expenses not allocated to the reporting segments.
the company derives its revenues principally from: (a) premiums earned for insurance coverage provided to insureds; (b) asset management fees on mutual fund and etp assets; (c) net investment income; (d) fees earned for services provided to third parties; and (e) net realized capital gains and losses. premiums charged for insurance coverage are earned principally on a pro rata basis over the terms of the related policies in-force.
the profitability of the company's property and casualty insurance businesses over time is greatly influenced by the company's underwriting discipline, which seeks to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, its management of claims, its use of reinsurance, the size of its in force block, actual mortality and morbidity experience, and its ability to manage its expense ratio which it accomplishes through economies of scale and its management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses. pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future loss cost frequency and severity based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, the company's response to rate actions taken by competitors, its expense levels and expectations about regulatory and legal developments. the company seeks to price its insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will cover underwriting expenses and the ultimate cost of paying claims reported on the policies and provide for a profit margin. for many of its insurance products, the company is required to obtain approval for its premium rates from state insurance departments.
similar to property & casualty, profitability of the group benefits business depends, in large part, on the ability to evaluate and price risks appropriately and make reliable estimates of mortality, morbidity, disability and longevity. to manage the pricing risk, group benefits generally offers term insurance policies, allowing for the adjustment of rates or policy terms in order to minimize the adverse effect of market trends, loss costs, declining interest rates and other factors. however, as policies are typically sold with rate guarantees of up to three years, pricing for the company's products could prove to be inadequate if loss trends emerge adversely during the rate guarantee period. for some of its products, the company is required to obtain approval for its premium rates from state insurance departments. new and renewal business for group benefits business, particularly for long-term disability, are priced using an assumption about expected investment yields over time. while the company employs asset-liability duration matching strategies to mitigate risk and may use interest-rate sensitive derivatives to hedge its exposure in the group benefits investment portfolio, cash flow patterns related to the payment of benefits and claims are uncertain and actual investment yields could differ significantly from expected investment yields, affecting profitability of the
36
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business. in addition to appropriately evaluating and pricing risks, the profitability of the group benefits business depends on other factors, including the company's response to pricing decisions and other actions taken by competitors, its ability to offer voluntary products and self-service capabilities, the persistency of its sold business and its ability to manage its expenses which it seeks to achieve through economies of scale and operating efficiencies.
the financial results in the company's mutual fund and etp businesses depend largely on the amount of assets under management on which it earns fees and the level of fees charged. changes in assets under management are driven by two main factors: net flows, and the market return of the funds, which is heavily influenced by the return realized in the equity markets. net flows are comprised of new sales less redemptions by mutual fund and etp shareholders. financial results are highly correlated to the growth in assets under management since these products generally earn fee income on a daily basis.
the investment return, or yield, on invested assets is an important element of the company's earnings since insurance products are priced with the assumption that premiums received can be invested for a period of time before benefits, loss and loss adjustment expenses are paid. due to the need to maintain sufficient liquidity to satisfy claim obligations, the majority of the company's invested assets have been held in available-for-sale securities, including, among other asset classes, equities, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, government debt, short-term debt, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations.
the primary investment objective for the company is to maximize economic value, consistent with acceptable risk parameters, including the management of credit risk and interest rate sensitivity of invested assets, while generating sufficient after-tax income to meet policyholder and corporate obligations. investment strategies are developed based on a variety of factors including business needs, regulatory requirements and tax considerations.

financial highlights net (loss) income   net income (loss) per diluted share   book value per diluted share net loss of $3,131, or $8.61 per basic and diluted share, compared with prior year net income of $896, or $2.31 per basic share and $2.27 per diluted share. the change from net income in 2016 to a net loss in 2017 was mostly due to a loss on discontinued operations of $2.9 billion related to the pending sale of the life and annuity run-off business, a charge to income tax expense of $877 arising primarily from the reduction of net deferred tax assets due to the enactment of lower federal income tax rates and a pension settlement charge of $488 after-tax.
common share repurchases during 2017 totaled $1,028 million, or 20.2 million shares and $341 of dividends were paid to shareholders.
book value per diluted common share decreased to $37.11 from $44.35 as of december 31, 2016 as a result of a $3.4 billion, or 20%, decrease in shareholders' equity largely due to a $3.3 billion loss on the pending sale of the life and annuity run-off business, partially offset by the effect of a 5% decrease in common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares.
37
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations net investment income   investment yield after-tax net investment income increased 2% to $1,603 compared with the prior year primarily due to higher income from limited partnerships and other alternative investments, partially offset by lower make-whole payment income on fixed maturities and increased investment expenses.
net realized capital gains of $165 compared to net realized capital losses of $110 in 2016, primarily due to higher net gains on sales, lower impairments and the effect of losses in 2016 related to the sale of the company's u.k. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries and the write-down of investments in solar energy partnerships that generated tax benefits.
annualized investment yield, after-tax of 3.0%, was up 0.1 points from 2016 as the effect of higher returns on limited partnerships and alternative investments was partially offset by the effect of lower make-whole payment income and reinvesting at lower yields.
net unrealized gains, after-tax, in the investment portfolio increased by $655 compared with the prior year due primarily to tighter credit spreads.
written premiums   combined ratio written premiums decreased slightly compared with the prior year for property & casualty, comprised of 3% growth in commercial lines and a 7% decrease in personal lines.
combined ratio of 100.0 compared with 100.1 in the prior year for property & casualty, as a higher combined ratio in commercial lines was largely offset by the effect of asbestos and environmental reserve strengthening in p&c other operations in 2016 and modest improvement in the personal lines combined ratio.
catastrophe losses of $836, before tax, increased from catastrophe losses of $416, before tax, in the prior year, largely due to losses in 2017 from hurricanes harvey and irma and wildfires in california.
38
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations prior accident year development was favorable $41 in 2017 compared to unfavorable reserve development of $457 in 2016 with reserve increases in 2016 largely due to a $268 increase in asbestos and environmental reserves and a $160 increase in personal lines auto liability reserves.
group benefits net income margin net income margin increased to 7.2% from 6.3% in the prior year for group benefits, primarily due to $52 of income tax benefits arising primarily from the reduction of net deferred tax liabilities due to the enactment of lower federal income tax rates.

part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016
net income (loss) decreased from net income in 2016 to a net loss in 2017 primarily due to a loss on discontinued operations of $2.9 billion related to the pending sale of the life and annuity run-off business, a charge to income tax expense of $877 arising primarily from the reduction of net deferred tax assets due to the enactment of lower federal income tax rates and a pension settlement charge of $488 after-tax. partially offsetting the decline were the effects of a $179 after-tax change from net realized capital losses in 2016 to net realized capital gains in 2017, the effect of a $423 after-tax charge in 2016 related to a loss on reinsurance covering the company's asbestos and environmental exposures and a reduction in the valuation allowance on capital loss carryovers in 2016. in addition, a $324 after-tax improvement in p&c prior accident year development and higher earnings in group benefits and mutual funds were largely offset by a $273 after-tax increase in current accident year catastrophes and higher variable incentive compensation.
earned premiums increased by $444, before tax, reflecting growth of 3% in commercial lines, including the effect of the maxum acquisition, and 14% in group benefits, including the effect of acquiring the aetna u.s. group life and disability business, partially offset by a 5% decrease in personal lines. for a discussion of the company's operating results by segment, see md&a - results of operations by segment.
fee income increased reflecting a 15% increase in mutual funds due to higher assets under management driven by market appreciation and positive net flows and the addition of schroders funds in the fourth quarter of 2016. for a discussion of the company's operating results by segment, see md&a - results of operations by segment.
net investment income increased 2%, primarily due to higher income from limited partnerships and other alternative investments, partially offset by lower make-whole payment income on fixed maturities and increased investment expenses. for further discussion of investment results, see md&a - investment results, net investment income (loss).
net realized capital gains of $165 before-tax compared to net realized capital losses of $110 before-tax in 2016, primarily due to higher net gains on sales, lower impairments and the effect of losses in 2016 related to the sale of the company's u.k. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries and the write-down of investments in solar energy partnerships in 2016 that generated tax benefits. for further discussion of investment results, see md&a - investment results, net realized capital gains (losses).
benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses increased 11% in group benefits and decreased 1% in p&c. the increase in group benefits was largely due to the acquisition of aetna's u.s. group life and disability business. the decrease in p&c was primarily due to the effect of unfavorable prior accident year reserve development in 2016, largely offset by higher catastrophe losses in 2017.
•   current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes in property &amp; casualty were relatively flat, primarily resulting from improved loss ratios and lower earned premiums in personal lines, offset by higher loss ratios in workers' compensation and general liability.
•   current accident year catastrophe losses of $836, before tax, compared to $416, before tax, for the prior year period. catastrophe losses in 2017 were primarily due to hurricanes harvey and irma, california wildfires and multiple wind and hail events across various u.s. geographic regions, primarily in the midwest, colorado, texas and the southeast. catastrophe losses in 2016 were primarily due to multiple wind and hail and winter storm events across various u.s. geographic regions, concentrated in texas and the central and southern plains and, to a lesser extent, winter storms and hurricane matthew. for additional information, see md&amp;a - critical accounting estimates, property &amp; casualty insurance product reserves, net of reinsurance.
•   favorable prior accident year reserve development in property &amp; casualty of $41, before tax, compared to unfavorable reserve development of $457, before tax, for the prior year period. prior accident year development in 2017 primarily included decreases in reserves for workers' compensation and small commercial package business, partially offset by an increase in reserves for bond claims. prior accident year development in 2016 was largely due to a $268 increase in asbestos and environmental reserves and a $160 increase in personal lines auto liability reserves. for additional information, see md&amp;a - critical accounting estimates, reserve roll forwards and development.
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs was relatively flat as higher amortization on higher earned premium for commercial lines was offset by lower amortization on lower earned premium for personal lines.
insurance operating costs and other expenses increased primarily due to a $750 pre-tax pension settlement charge. apart from the pension settlement charge, insurance operating costs and other expenses increased by 9%, primarily driven by higher variable incentive plan compensation, increased it costs in commercial lines, higher variable expenses in mutual funds and $20, before tax, of state guaranty fund assessments in group benefits, partially offset by lower direct marketing and operation costs in personal lines. effective with awards granted in march, 2017, long-term incentive compensation awards to retirement-eligible employees now fully vest when they are granted, which resulted in an accelerated recognition of compensation expense in 2017 of $22 before-tax. for additional information on the pension settlement charge in second quarter 2017, see note 15 - employee benefit plans of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements.
amortization of other intangible assets increased by $10 largely due to amortization of identifiable intangible assets recorded as a result of the acquisition of the aetna u.s. group life and disability business, including in-force contracts, customer relationships and a marketing agreement with aetna.
income tax expense increased primarily due to a charge of $877 as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act ("tax reform") enacted in december, 2017. among other changes, tax reform reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018 which resulted in a reduction of the

part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company's net deferred tax assets, including its net operating loss carryovers. also contributing to the increase in income tax expense were federal income tax benefits of $113 in 2016 arising from investments in solar energy partnerships that generated tax benefits and the effect of a federal income tax benefit of $65 in 2016 related to the sale of the company's u.k. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries.
differences between the company's effective income tax rate and the u.s. statutory rate of 35% are due primarily to the effects of tax reform on net deferred tax assets, tax exempt interest earned on invested assets, changes in the valuation allowance recorded on capital loss carryovers and federal tax credits associated with investments in solar energy partnerships. for further discussion of income taxes, see note 16 - income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements.
income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax decreased from income of $283 in 2016 to a net loss of $2.9 billion in 2017 with the net loss in 2017 due to a loss on sale of the company's life and annuity run-off business of $3.3 billion, partially offset by operating income from discontinued operations of $388. operating income from discontinued operations increased from $283 in 2016 primarily due to lower net realized capital losses in 2017. apart from the reduction in net realized capital losses, earnings were relatively flat as an increase in the unlock benefit and lower interest credited were largely offset by lower net investment income and lower fee income due to the continued run-off of the variable annuity block.
year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
net income decreased primarily due to a loss on a reinsurance transaction covering the company's asbestos and environmental exposure, an increase in property & casualty and group benefits incurred losses, especially in personal lines, higher net realized capital losses, lower income from discontinued operations and lower mutual funds fee income, partially offset by higher earned premiums, higher net investment income and lower insurance operating costs and other expenses.
earned premiums increased 2% or $212, before tax, reflecting growth of 2% in commercial lines, 1% in personal lines and 3% in group benefits. for a discussion of the company's operating results by segment, see md&a - results of operations by segment.
fee income decreased in 2016 compared to the prior year period, primarily due to lower investment management fees in mutual funds as a result of lower daily assets under management.
net investment income increased, primarily due to higher asset levels partially offset by lower make-whole payments on fixed maturities, as well as reinvesting at lower interest rates. for further discussion of investment results, see the net investment income (loss) section within md&a - investment results.
net realized capital losses were $110 in 2016 an increase from net realized capital losses of $12 in 2015 primarily due to losses associated with the sale of the company's u.k. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries and a change from net gains to net losses on non-qualifying derivatives, partially offset by lower impairments and an increase in net realized gains on sale of corporate securities, u.s. treasury securities, municipal bonds and equity securities. also contributing to the increase in net realized capital losses was a $96 write-down of an investment in solar energy partnerships that generated tax credits and other tax benefits of $113 in 2016. for further discussion of investment results, see the net realized capital gains (losses) section within md&a - investment results, benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses increased in both property & casualty and group benefits with the increase in group benefits due to the effect of growth in earned premium and higher group life loss severity. the net increase in incurred losses for property & casualty was due to:
•   losses and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes and prior accident year development in property &amp; casualty increased $259, before tax, primarily resulting from higher personal and commercial auto loss costs and the effect of earned premium growth in small commercial and personal lines, partially offset by lower workers' compensation loss costs.
•   current accident year catastrophe losses of $416, before tax, in 2016, compared to $332, before tax, in 2015. catastrophe losses in 2016 were primarily due to multiple wind and hail events across various u.s. geographic regions, concentrated in texas and the central and southern plains and, to a lesser extent, winter storms and hurricane matthew. catastrophe losses in 2015 were primarily due to multiple winter storms and wind and hail events across various u.s. geographic regions as well as tornadoes and wildfires. for additional information, see md&amp;a - critical accounting estimates, property &amp; casualty insurance product reserves.
•   unfavorable prior accident year reserve development in property &amp; casualty of $457, before tax, in 2016, compared to unfavorable reserve development of $250, before tax, in 2015.
▪   prior accident year reserve development in 2016 was primarily due to a $268 increase in asbestos and environmental reserves and a $160 increase in personal auto liability reserves. an increase in asbestos reserves of $197 primarily related to greater than expected mesothelioma claim filings for a small percentage of defendants in specific, adverse jurisdictions. as a result, aggregate indemnity and defense costs have not declined as expected. environmental reserves increased $71 in 2016 primarily due to deterioration associated with the tendering of new sites for policy coverage, increased defense costs stemming from individual bodily injury liability suits, and increased clean-up costs associated with waterways. reserves were increased in personal lines auto liability for accident years 2014 and 2015, primarily due to higher than expected emerged auto liability frequency and severity.
▪   prior accident year reserve development in 2015 was primarily due to an increase in asbestos reserves of $146 and environmental reserves of $52. for additional information, see md&amp;a - critical accounting estimates, reserve roll-forwards and development.

part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations insurance operating costs and other expenses decreased $118 primarily due to a reduction in direct marketing expenses in personal lines.
loss on extinguishment of debt decreased due to the redemption of $296 aggregate principal amount outstanding of 4.0% senior notes in 2015. there were no early debt extinguishments in 2016.
loss on reinsurance transaction in 2016 represents paid premium for an asbestos and environmental adverse development cover ("adc") reinsurance agreement with nico, a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway inc. ("berkshire"), to reduce uncertainty about potential adverse development. for more information on this transaction, see md&a -critical accounting estimates, annual reserve reviews.
income tax benefit of $166 in 2016 compared to income tax expense of $289 in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in taxable income and the effect of $113 of federal tax credits and other tax benefits in 2016 associated with investments in solar energy partnerships, as well as tax benefits in 2016 from the sale of the company's u.k property and casualty run-off subsidiaries.
differences between the company's effective income tax rate and the u.s. statutory rate of 35% are due primarily to tax exempt interest earned on invested assets, changes in the valuation allowance recorded on capital loss carryovers and federal tax credits associated with investments in solar energy partnerships.
income from discontinued operations, net of tax, decreased from 2015 to 2016 primarily due to lower tax benefits recognized in 2016, a write-off of dac associated with fixed annuities, lower investment income and a reinsurance gain on disposition in 2015, partially offset by lower net realized capital losses. in addition, the continued run-off of the variable and fixed annuity block resulted in lower fee income, partially offset by lower amortization of dac and lower insurance operating costs and other expenses.

[3]   primarily includes income from derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting and hedge fixed maturities.
year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016
total net investment income increased primarily due to higher income from limited partnerships and other alternative investments, partially offset by lower make-whole payment income on fixed maturities and increased investment expense. income from limited partnerships and other alternative investments increased due to higher valuation write-ups of private equity partnerships and strong returns on real estate investments in 2017.
annualized net investment income yield excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments, was 3.7% in 2017 and 3.8% in 2016. excluding make-whole payment income on fixed maturities, income received from previously impaired securities, and prepayment penalties on mortgage loans, the annualized investment income yield, excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments, was 3.6% in 2017 consistent with that of the same period for 2016.
average reinvestment rate excluding certain u.s. treasury securities and cash equivalent securities, for the year ended december 31, 2017, was approximately 3.5% which was below the average yield of sales and maturities of 3.7% for the same period. for the year ended december 31, 2017, the average reinvestment rate of 3.5% remained consistent with that of the same period in 2016.
we expect the annualized net investment income yield for the 2018 calendar year, excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments, to be slightly below the portfolio yield earned in 2017. this assumes the company earns less income in 2018 from make-whole payment income on fixed maturities and recoveries on previously impaired securities than it did in 2017 and that reinvestment rates continue to be below the average yield of sales and maturities. the estimated impact on net investment income is subject to change as the composition of the portfolio changes through portfolio management and changes in market conditions.
year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
total net investment income increased primarily due to higher asset levels, partially offset by lower make-whole payments on fixed maturities as well as reinvesting at lower interest rates.

gross gains and losses on sales were primarily the result of duration, liquidity and credit management within corporate securities, u.s. treasury securities, equity securities, and tax-exempt municipal bonds.
other, net gain included gains of $21 related to credit derivatives due to credit spread tightening, partially offset by losses of $7 related to equity derivatives hedging against the impact of a decline in the equity market on the investment portfolio.
year ended december 31, 2016
gross gains and losses on sales were primarily a result of duration, liquidity and credit management within corporate, u.s. treasury, tax-exempt municipal and equity securities.
other, net loss included losses of $96 related to the write-down of investments in solar energy partnerships that generated solar tax credits and losses of $81 associated with the company's u.k. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries that were sold in may 2017. for further information related to the investment in solar energy partnerships and resulting solar tax credits, refer to note 16 - income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements. in addition, there were losses of $15 related to equity derivatives which were hedging against the impact of a decline in the equity market on the investment portfolio.
year ended december 31, 2015
gross gains and losses on sales were primarily a result of duration, liquidity and credit management, as well as tactical changes to the portfolio as a result of changing market conditions. this included sales to reduce exposure to energy, emerging markets and below investment grade corporate securities as well as sales within corporate, u.s. treasury and equity securities.
other, net losses were primarily related to losses of $7 on credit derivatives driven by widening credit spreads.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ, and in the past have differed, from those estimates.
the company has identified the following estimates as critical in that they involve a higher degree of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability:
•   property and casualty insurance product reserves, net of reinsurance;
•   group benefit long-term disability (ltd) reserves, net of reinsurance;
•   evaluation of goodwill for impairment;
•   valuation of investments and derivative instruments including evaluation of other-than-temporary impairments on available-for-sale securities and valuation allowances on mortgage loans;
•   valuation allowance on deferred tax assets; and
•   contingencies relating to corporate litigation and regulatory matters.
certain of these estimates are particularly sensitive to market conditions, and deterioration and/or volatility in the worldwide debt or equity markets could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. in developing these estimates management makes subjective and complex judgments that are inherently uncertain and subject to material change as facts and circumstances develop. although variability is inherent in these estimates, management believes the amounts provided are appropriate based upon the facts available upon compilation of the financial statements.

overview of reserving for property and casualty insurance claims it typically takes many months or years to pay claims incurred under a property and casualty insurance product; accordingly, the company must establish reserves at the time the loss is incurred. most of the company's policies provide for occurrence-based coverage where the loss is incurred when a claim event happens like an automobile accident, house or building fire or injury to an employee under a workers' compensation policy. some of the company's policies, mostly for directors and officers insurance and errors and omissions insurance, are claims-made policies where the loss is incurred in the period the claim event is reported to the company even if the loss event itself occurred in an earlier period.
45
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations loss and loss adjustment expense reserves provide for the estimated ultimate costs of paying claims under insurance policies written by the company, less amounts paid to date. these reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have not yet been reported, and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. incurred but not reported ("ibnr") reserves represent the difference between the estimated ultimate cost of all claims and the actual loss and loss adjustment expenses reported to the company by claimants ("reported losses"). reported losses represent cumulative loss and loss adjustment expenses paid plus case reserves for outstanding reported claims. company actuaries evaluate the total reserves (ibnr and case reserves) on an accident year basis. an accident year is the calendar year in which a loss is incurred, or, in the case of claims-made policies, the calendar year in which a loss is reported.
factors that change reserve estimates- reserve estimates can change over time because of unexpected changes in the external environment. inflation in medical care, hospital care, automobile parts, wages and home and building repair would cause claims to settle for more than they are initially reserved. changes in the economy can cause an increase or decrease in the number of reported claims (claim frequency). for example, an improving economy could result in more automobile miles driven and a higher number of automobile reported claims while a contracting economy can sometimes lead to an increase in workers' compensation reported claims. an increase in the number or percentage of claims litigated can increase the average settlement amount per claim (claim severity). changes in the judicial environment can affect interpretations of damages and how policy coverage applies which could increase or decrease claim severity. over time, judges or juries in certain jurisdictions may be more inclined to determine liability and award damages. new legislation can also change how damages are defined resulting in greater frequency or severity. in addition, new types of injuries may arise from exposures not contemplated when the policies were written. past examples include pharmaceutical products, silica, lead paint, molestation or abuse and construction defects.
reserve estimates can also change over time because of changes in internal company operations. a delay or acceleration in handling claims may signal a need to increase or reduce reserves from what was initially estimated. new lines of business may have loss development patterns that are not well established. changes in the geographic mix of business, changes in the mix of business by industry and changes in the mix of business by policy limit or deductible can increase the risk that losses will ultimately develop differently than the loss development patterns assumed in our reserving. in addition, changes in the quality of risk selection in underwriting and changes in interpretations of policy language could increase or decrease ultimate losses from what was assumed in establishing the reserves.
in the case of assumed reinsurance, all of the above risks apply. the company assumes insurance risk from certain pools and associations and, prior to 2004, assumed property and casualty risks from other insurance companies. changes in the case reserving and reporting patterns of insurance companies ceding to the hartford can create additional uncertainty in estimating the reserves. due to the inherent complexity of the assumptions used, final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates of direct and assumed reserves, particularly when those settlements may not occur until well into the future.
reinsurance recoverables- through both facultative and treaty reinsurance agreements, the company cedes a share of the risks it has underwritten to other insurance companies. the company records reinsurance recoverables for loss and loss adjustment expenses ceded to its reinsurers representing the anticipated recovery from reinsurers of unpaid claims, including ibnr.
the company estimates the portion of losses and loss adjustment expenses to be ceded based on the terms of any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance, including an estimate of how ibnr for losses will ultimately be ceded.
the company provides an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, reflecting management's best estimate of reinsurance cessions that may be uncollectible in the future due to reinsurers' unwillingness or inability to pay. the estimated allowance considers the credit quality of the company's reinsurers, recent outcomes in arbitration and litigation in disputes between reinsurers and cedants and recent communication activity between reinsurers and cedants that may signal how the company's own reinsurance claims may settle. where its reinsurance contracts permit, the company secures funding of future claim obligations with various forms of collateral, including irrevocable letters of credit, secured trusts, funds held accounts and group-wide offsets. the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was $104 as of december 31, 2017, comprised of $18 related to commercial lines and $86 related to property & casualty other operations.
the company's estimate of reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimate of the gross reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for direct and assumed exposures.
review of reserve adequacy- the hartford regularly reviews the appropriateness of reserve levels at the line of business or more detailed level, taking into consideration the variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement of claims. for property & casualty other operations, asbestos and environmental ("a&e") reserves are reviewed by type of event rather than by line of business.
reserve adjustments, which may be material, are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary. in the judgment of management, information currently available has been properly considered in establishing the reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and in recording the reinsurance recoverables for ceded unpaid losses.
reserving methodology for a discussion of how a&e reserves are set, see md&a - p&c insurance product reserves, reserving for asbestos and environmental claims within property & casualty other operations. the following is a discussion of the reserving methods used for the company's property and casualty lines of business other than asbestos and environmental.
how reserves are set- reserves are set by line of business within the operating segments. a single line of business
46
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations may be written in more than one segment. case reserves are established by a claims handler on each individual claim and are adjusted as new information becomes known during the course of handling the claim. lines of business for which reported losses emerge over a long period of time are referred to as long-tail lines of business. lines of business for which reported losses emerge more quickly are referred to as short-tail lines of business. the company's shortest-tail lines of business are homeowners, commercial property and automobile physical damage. the longest tail lines of business include workers' compensation, general liability, professional liability and assumed reinsurance. for short-tail lines of business, emergence of paid loss and case reserves is credible and likely indicative of ultimate losses. for long-tail lines of business, emergence of paid losses and case reserves is less credible in the early periods after a given accident year and, accordingly, may not be indicative of ultimate losses.
use of actuarial methods and judgments- the company's reserving actuaries regularly review reserves for both current and prior accident years using the most current claim data. a variety of actuarial methods and judgments are used for most lines of business to arrive at selections of estimated ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. these selections incorporate input, as appropriate, from claims personnel, pricing actuaries and operating management about reported loss cost trends and other factors that could affect the reserve estimates. most reserves are reviewed fully each quarter, including loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for homeowners, commercial property, automobile physical damage, automobile liability, package business, workers' compensation, most general liability and professional liability. other reserves are reviewed semi-annually (twice per year) or annually. these primarily include reserves for losses incurred in accident years older than twelve years for personal lines and older than twenty years for commercial lines, as well as reserves for bond, assumed reinsurance, latent exposures, such as construction defects, and unallocated loss adjustment expenses. for reserves that are reviewed semi-annually or annually, management monitors the emergence of paid and reported losses in the intervening quarters and, if necessary, performs a reserve review to determine whether the reserve estimate should change.
an expected loss ratio is used in initially recording the reserves for both short-tail and long-tail lines of business. this expected loss ratio is determined by starting with the average loss ratio of recent prior accident years and adjusting that ratio for the effect of expected changes to earned pricing, loss frequency and severity, mix of business, ceded reinsurance and other factors. for short-tail lines, ibnr for the current accident year is initially recorded as the product of the expected loss ratio for the period, earned premium for the period and the proportion of losses expected to be reported in future calendar periods for the current accident period. for long-tailed lines, ibnr reserves for the current accident year are initially recorded as the product of the expected loss ratio for the period and the earned premium for the period, less reported losses for the period.
as losses emerge or develop in periods subsequent to a given accident year, reserving actuaries use other methods to estimate ultimate unpaid losses in addition to the expected loss ratio method. these primarily include paid and reported loss development methods, frequency/severity techniques and the bornhuetter-ferguson method (a combination of the expected loss ratio and paid development or reported development method). within any one line of business, the methods that are given more influence vary based primarily on the maturity of the accident year, the mix of business and the particular internal and external influences impacting the claims experience or the methods. the output of the reserve reviews are reserve estimates that are referred to herein as the "actuarial indication".
reserve discounting- most of the company's property and casualty insurance product reserves are not discounted. however, the company has discounted liabilities funded through structured settlements and has discounted certain reserves for indemnity payments due to permanently disabled claimants under workers' compensation policies. for further discussion of these discounted liabilities, see note 1 - basis of presentation and significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements.
differences between gaap and statutory basis reserves- as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, u.s. property and casualty insurance product reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance recoverables, reported under u.s. gaap were approximately equal to net reserves reported on a statutory basis. the primary difference between the statutory and gaap reserve amounts is due to a ceded asbestos and environmental adc which is a retroactive reinsurance agreement between the company and nico that is not included in insurance liabilities for statutory accounting. this difference is largely offset by liabilities for unpaid losses for permanently disabled workers' compensation claimants discounted under u.s. gaap at rates that are no higher than risk-free interest rates in effect at the time the claims are incurred which can vary from the statutory discount rates set by regulators. in addition, a portion of the u.s. gaap provision for uncollectible reinsurance is not recognized under statutory accounting.
reserving methods by line of business- apart from a&e which is discussed in the following section on property & casualty other operations, below is a general discussion of which reserving methods are preferred by line of business. because the actuarial estimates are generated at a much finer level of detail than line of business (e.g., by distribution channel, coverage, accident period), other methods than those described for the line of business may also be employed for a coverage and accident year within a line of business. also, as circumstances change, the methods that are given more influence will change.
47
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations preferred reserving methods by line of business commercial property, homeowners and automobile physical damage                   these short-tailed lines are fast-developing and paid and reported development techniques are used as these methods use historical data to develop paid and reported loss development patterns, which are then applied to cumulative paid and reported losses by accident period to estimate ultimate losses. in addition to paid and reported development methods, for the most immature accident months, the company uses frequency and severity techniques and the initial expected loss ratio. the advantage of frequency/severity techniques is that frequency estimates are generally easier to predict and external information can be used to supplement internal data in estimating average severity.
personal automobile liability                                                    for automobile liability, and bodily injury in particular, the company performs a greater number of techniques than it does for commercial property, homeowners and automobile physical damage. in addition to traditional paid and reported development methods, the company relies on frequency/severity techniques and berquist-sherman techniques. because the paid development technique is affected by changes in claim closure patterns and the reported development method is affected by changes in case reserving practices, the company uses berquist-sherman techniques which adjust these patterns to reflect current settlement rates and case reserving practices. the company generally uses the reported development method for older accident years and a combination of reported development, frequency/severity and berquist-sherman methods for more recent accident years. for older accident periods, reported losses are a good indicator of ultimate losses given the high percentage of ultimate losses reported to date. for more recent periods, the frequency/severity techniques are not affected as much by changes in case reserve practices and changing disposal rates and the berquist-sherman techniques specifically adjust for these changes.
automobile liability for commercial lines and short-tailed general liability     for older, more mature accident years, the company primarily uses reported development techniques. for more recent accident years, the company typically prefers frequency / severity techniques. these techniques separately analyze losses above and below a capping level (average severity) as larger claims typically behave differently than smaller claims.
professional liability                                                           reported and paid loss development patterns for this line tend to be volatile. therefore, the company typically relies on frequency and severity techniques.
long-tailed general liability, bond and large deductible workers' compensation   for these long-tailed lines of business, the company generally relies on the expected loss ratio and reported development techniques. the company generally weights these techniques together, relying more heavily on the expected loss ratio method at early ages of development and more on the reported development method as an accident year matures.
workers' compensation                                                            workers' compensation is the company's single largest reserve line of business and a wide range of methods are used. methods include paid and reported development techniques, the expected loss ratio and bornhuetter-ferguson methods, and an in-depth analysis on the largest states. in recent years, we have seen an acceleration of paid losses relative to historical patterns and have adjusted our expected loss development patterns accordingly. this acceleration has largely been due to two factors. first, in more recent accident years, we have seen a higher concentration of first dollar workers' compensation business and less excess of loss business resulting in fewer longer-tailed, excess workers' compensation claims. second, the company has seen an increase in lump sum settlements to claimants across multiple accident years. adjusting for the effect of an acceleration in payments compared to historical patterns, paid loss development techniques are generally preferred for the workers' compensation line, particularly for more mature accident years. for less mature accident years, the company places greater reliance on the expected loss ratio and reported development methods, open claim approaches, and state-by-state analysis.
assumed reinsurance and all other                                                for these lines, the company tends to rely mostly on reported development techniques. in assumed reinsurance, assumptions are influenced by information gained from claim and underwriting audits.
allocated loss adjustment expenses (alae)                                        for some lines of business (e.g., professional liability and assumed reinsurance), alae and losses are analyzed together. for most lines of business, however, alae is analyzed separately, using paid development techniques and a ratio of paid alae to paid loss is applied to loss reserves to estimate unpaid alae.
unallocated loss adjustment expenses (ulae)                                      ulae is analyzed separately from loss and alae. for most lines of business, incurred ulae costs to be paid in the future are projected based on an expected claim handling cost per claim year, the anticipated claim closure pattern and the ratio of paid ulae to paid loss is applied to estimated unpaid losses.
in the final step of the reserve review process, senior reserving actuaries and senior management apply their judgment to determine the appropriate level of reserves considering the actuarial indications and other factors not contemplated in the actuarial indications. those factors include, but are not limited to, the assessed reliability of key loss trends and assumptions used in the current actuarial indications, the maturity of the accident year, pertinent trends observed over the recent past, the level of volatility within a particular line of business, and the improvement or deterioration of actuarial indications in the current period as compared to the prior periods. the company also considers the magnitude of the difference between the actuarial indication and the recorded reserves.
based on the results of the quarterly reserve review process, the company determines the appropriate reserve adjustments, if any, to record. in general, adjustments are made more quickly to more mature accident years and less volatile lines of business. such adjustments of reserves are referred to as "prior accident year development". increases in previous estimates of ultimate loss costs are referred to as either an increase in prior accident year reserves or as unfavorable reserve development. decreases in previous estimates of ultimate loss costs are referred to as either a decrease in prior accident year reserves or as favorable reserve development. reserve development can influence the comparability of year over year underwriting results.
total recorded net reserves, excluding asbestos and environmental, were 4.7% higher than the actuarial indication of the reserves as of december 31, 2017.

current trends contributing to reserve uncertainty the hartford is a multi-line company in the property and casualty insurance business. the hartford is therefore subject to reserve uncertainty stemming from changes in loss trends and other conditions which could become material at any point in time. as market conditions and loss trends develop, management must assess whether those conditions constitute a long-term trend that should result in a reserving action (i.e., increasing or decreasing the reserve).
difficult to estimate tort exposures- within commercial lines and property & casualty other operations, the company has exposure to bodily injury claims as a result of long-term or continuous exposure to harmful products or substances. examples include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutical products, silica, talcum powder, head injuries and lead paint. the company also has exposure to claims from construction defects, where property damage or bodily injury from negligent construction is alleged. in addition, the company has exposure to claims asserted against religious institutions and other organizations relating to molestation or abuse. such exposures may involve potentially long latency periods and may implicate coverage in multiple policy periods. these factors make reserves for such claims more uncertain than other bodily injury or property damage claims. with regard to these exposures, the company monitors trends in litigation, the external environment, the similarities to other mass torts and the potential impact on the company's reserves.
standard commercial lines- in standard commercial lines, workers' compensation is the company's single biggest line of business and the line of business with the longest pattern of loss emergence. to the extent that patterns in the frequency of settlement payments deviate from historical patterns, loss reserve estimates would be less reliable. medical costs make up more than 50% of workers' compensation payments. as such, reserve estimates for workers' compensation are particularly sensitive to changes in medical inflation, the changing use of medical care procedures and changes in state legislative and regulatory environments. in addition, a deteriorating economic environment can reduce the ability of an injured worker to return to work and lengthen the time a worker receives disability benefits.
specialty lines- in specialty lines, many lines of insurance are "long-tail", including large deductible workers' compensation insurance; as such, reserve estimates for these lines are more difficult to determine than reserve estimates for shorter-tail lines of insurance. reserves for large deductible workers' compensation insurance require estimating losses attributable to the deductible amount that will be paid by the insured; if such losses are not paid by the insured due to financial difficulties, the company is contractually liable. uncertainty in estimated claim severity causes reserve variability for commercial automobile losses including reserve variability due to changes in internal claim handling and case reserving practices as well as due to changes in the external environment. another example of reserve variability is with directors' and officers' insurance where uncertainty regarding the number and severity of class action suits can result in reserve volatility. additionally, the company's exposure to losses under directors' and officers' insurance policies is primarily in excess layers, making estimates of loss more complex.
personal lines- in personal lines, while claims emerge over relatively shorter periods, estimates can still vary due to a number of factors, including uncertain estimates of frequency and severity trends. severity trends are affected by changes in internal claim handling and case reserving practices as well as by changes in the external environment. changes in claim practices increase the uncertainty in the interpretation of case reserve data, which increases the uncertainty in recorded reserve levels. severity trends have increased in recent accident years, in part driven by more expensive parts associated with new automobile technology, causing additional uncertainty about the reliability of past patterns. in addition, the introduction of new products and class plans has led to a different mix of business by type of insured than the company experienced in the past. such changes in mix increase the uncertainty of the reserve projections, since historical data and reporting patterns may not be applicable to the new business.
impact of key assumptions on reserves as stated above, the company's practice is to estimate reserves using a variety of methods, assumptions and data elements within its reserve estimation process for reserves other than asbestos and environmental. the company does not consistently use statistical loss distributions or confidence levels around its reserve estimate and, as a result, does not disclose reserve ranges.
across most lines of business, the most important reserve assumptions are future loss development factors applied to paid or reported losses to date. the trend in loss cost frequency and severity is also a key assumption, particularly in the most recent accident years, where loss development factors are less credible.
the following discussion discloses possible variation from current estimates of loss reserves due to a change in certain key indicators of potential losses. for automobile liability lines in both personal lines and commercial lines, the key indicator is the annual loss cost trend, particularly the severity trend component of loss costs. for workers' compensation and general liability, loss development patterns are a key indicator, particularly for more mature accident years. for workers' compensation, paid loss development patterns have been impacted by medical cost inflation and other changes in loss cost trends. for general liability, loss development patterns have been impacted by, among other things, emergence of new types of claims (e.g., construction defect claims) and a shift in the mixture between smaller, more routine claims and larger, more complex claims.
each of the impacts described below is estimated individually, without consideration for any correlation among key indicators or among lines of business. therefore, it would be inappropriate to take each of the amounts described below and add them together in an attempt to estimate volatility for the company's reserves in total. for any one reserving line of business, the estimated variation in reserves due to changes in key indicators is a reasonable estimate of possible variation that may occur in the future, likely over a period of several calendar years. the variation discussed is not meant to be a worst-case scenario, and,

reserving for asbestos and environmental claims how a&e reserves are set- the process for establishing reserves for asbestos and environmental claims first involves estimating the required reserves gross of ceded reinsurance and then estimating reinsurance recoverables. in establishing reserves for gross asbestos claims, the company evaluates its insureds' estimated liabilities for such claims by examining exposures for individual insureds and assessing how coverage applies. the company considers a variety of factors, including the jurisdictions where underlying claims have been brought, past, pending and anticipated future claim activity, disease mix, past settlement values of similar claims, dismissal rates, allocated loss adjustment expense, and potential bankruptcy impact.
similarly, the company reviews exposures to establish gross environmental reserves. the company considers several factors in estimating environmental liabilities, including historical values of similar claims, the number of sites involved, the insureds' alleged activities at each site, the alleged environmental damage, the respective shares of liability of potentially responsible parties, the appropriateness and cost of remediation, the nature of governmental enforcement activities and potential bankruptcy impact.
after evaluating its insureds' probable liabilities for asbestos and/or environmental claims, the company evaluates the insurance coverage in place for such claims. the company considers its insureds' total available insurance coverage, including the coverage issued by the company. the company also considers relevant judicial interpretations of policy language and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any.
the estimated liabilities of insureds and the company's exposure to the insureds depends heavily on an analysis of the relevant legal issues and litigation environment. this analysis is conducted by the company's lawyers and is subject to applicable privileges.
for both asbestos and environmental reserves, the company also analyzes its historical paid and reported losses and expenses year by year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid and reported activity. the historical losses and expenses are analyzed on both a direct basis and net of reinsurance.
once the gross ultimate exposure for indemnity and allocated loss adjustment expense is determined for its insureds by each policy year, the company calculates its ceded reinsurance projection based on any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance and the company's experience with reinsurance collections. see the section that follows entitled adverse development cover that discusses the impact the reinsurance agreement with nico may have on future adverse development of asbestos and environmental reserves, if any.
uncertainties regarding adequacy of a&e reserves- a number of factors affect the variability of estimates for gross asbestos and environmental reserves including assumptions with respect to the frequency of claims, the average severity of those claims settled with payment, the dismissal rate of claims with no payment, resolution of coverage disputes with our policyholders and the expense to indemnity ratio. reserve estimates for gross asbestos and environmental reserves are subject to greater variability than reserve estimates for more traditional exposures.
the process of estimating asbestos and environmental reserves remains subject to a wide variety of uncertainties, which are detailed in note 14 - commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements. the company believes that its current asbestos and environmental reserves are appropriate. while future developments could cause the company to change its estimates of its gross asbestos and environmental reserves, the adverse development cover with nico will likely lessen the effect that these changes would have on the company's consolidated operating results and liquidity. consistent with past practice, the company will continue to monitor its reserves in property & casualty other operations regularly, including its annual reviews of asbestos liabilities, reinsurance recoverables, the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, and environmental liabilities. where future developments indicate, we will make appropriate adjustments to the reserves at that time. in 2017, the company completed the comprehensive annual review of asbestos and environmental reserves during the fourth quarter, instead of the second quarter as it had done in previous years.
total p&c insurance product reserves development in the opinion of management, based upon the known facts and current law, the reserves recorded for the company's property and casualty insurance products at december 31, 2017 represent the company's best estimate of its ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses related to losses covered by policies written by the company. however, because of the significant
50
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations uncertainties surrounding reserves, it is possible that management's estimate of the ultimate liabilities for these claims may change in the future and that the required adjustment to currently recorded reserves could be material to the company's results of operations and liquidity.

during 2017, the company's re-estimates of prior accident year reserves included the following significant reserve changes:
workers' compensation reserves were reduced in small commercial and middle market, given the continued emergence of favorable frequency, primarily for accident years 2013 to 2015, as well as a reduction in estimated reserves for ulae, partially offset by strengthening reserves for captive programs within specialty commercial.
general liability reserves were increased for the 2013 to 2016 accident years on a class of business that insures service and maintenance contractors. this increase was partially offset by a decrease in recent accident year reserves for other middle market general liability reserves.
package business reserves were reduced for accident years 2013 and prior largely due to reducing the company's estimate of allocated loss adjustment expenses incurred to settle the claims.
bond business reserves increased for customs bonds written between 2000 and 2010 which was partly offset by a reduction in reserves for recent accident years as reported losses for commercial and contract surety have emerged favorably.
automobile liability reserves within commercial lines were increased in small commercial and large national accounts for the 2013 to 2016 accident years, driven by higher frequency of more severe accidents, including litigated claims.
asbestos and environmental reserves were unchanged as $285 of adverse development arising from the fourth quarter 2017 comprehensive annual review was offset by a $285 recoverable from nico. for additional information related to the adverse development cover with nico, see note 8 - reinsurance and note 14 - commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements.

during 2016, the company's re-estimates of prior accident year reserves included the following significant reserve changes:
workers' compensation reserves consider favorable emergence on reported losses for recent accident years as well as a partially offsetting adverse impact related to two recent florida supreme court rulings that have increased the company's exposure to workers' compensation claims in that state. the favorable emergence has been driven by lower frequency and, to a lesser extent, lower medical severity and management has placed additional weight on this favorable experience as it becomes more credible.
general liability reserves increased for accident years 2012 - 2015 primarily due to higher severity losses incurred on a class of business that insures service and maintenance contractors and increased for accident years 2008 and 2010 primarily due to indemnity losses and legal costs associated with a litigated claim.
package business reserves increased due to higher than expected severity on liability claims, principally for accident years 2013 - 2015. severity for these accident years has developed unfavorably and management has placed more weight on emerged experience.
professional liability reserves decreased for claims made years 2008 - 2013, primarily for large accounts, including on non-securities class action cases. claim costs have emerged favorably as these years have matured and management has placed more weight on the emerged experience.
automobile liability reserves increased due to increases in both commercial lines automobile and personal lines automobile. commercial automobile liability reserves increased, predominately for the 2015 accident year, primarily due to increased frequency of large claims. personal automobile liability reserves increased, primarily related to increased bodily injury frequency and severity for the 2015 accident year, including for uninsured and under-insured motorist claims, and increased bodily injury severity for the 2014 accident year. increases in automobile liability loss costs were across both the direct and agency distribution channels.
asbestos and environmental reserves were increased during the period as a result of the second quarter 2016 comprehensive annual review.
uncollectible reinsurance reserves decreased as a result of giving greater weight to favorable collectibility

during 2015, the company's re-estimates of prior accident year reserves included the following significant reserve changes:
workers' compensation reserves decreased due to an improvement in claim closure rates resulting in a decrease in outstanding claims for permanently disabled claimants. in addition, accident years 2013 and 2014 continue to exhibit favorable frequency and medical severity trends; management has been placing additional weight on this favorable experience as it becomes more credible.
package business reserves increased due to higher than expected severity on liability claims, impacting recent accident years.
professional liability reserves decreased for claims made years 2009 through 2012 primarily for large accounts. claim costs have emerged favorably as these years have matured and management has placed more weight on the emerged experience.
automobile liability reserves within commercial lines were increased due to increased severity of large claims predominantly for accident years 2010 to 2013.
asbestos and environmental reserves were increased during the period as a result of the 2015 comprehensive annual review.
catastrophe reserves decreased primarily for accident year 2014, as fourth quarter 2014 catastrophes have developed favorably.
other reserve re-estimates, net decreased due to decreased contract surety reserves across several accident years and decreased commercial surety reserves for accident years 2012 through 2014 as a result of lower emerged losses. these reserve decreases were offset by an increase in commercial surety reserves related to accident years 2007 and prior, as the number of new claims reported has outpaced expectations.
property & casualty other operations net reserves and reserve activity in property & casualty other operations are categorized and reported as asbestos, environmental, and "all other". the "all other" category of reserves covers a wide range of insurance and assumed reinsurance coverages, including, but not limited to, potential liability for construction defects, lead paint, silica, pharmaceutical products, molestation and other long-tail liabilities. in addition to various insurance and assumed reinsurance exposures, "all other" includes unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves. "all other" also includes the company's allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. when the company commutes a ceded reinsurance contract or settles a ceded reinsurance dispute, net reserves for the related cause of loss (including asbestos, environmental or all other) are increased for the portion of the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance attributable to that commutation or settlement.

part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations adverse development cover in december 31, 2016, the company entered into an asbestos and environmental adc reinsurance agreement with nico, a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway inc. ("berkshire"), to reduce uncertainty about potential adverse development of asbestos and environmental reserves. under the reinsurance agreement, nico assumes adverse net loss and allocated loss adjustment expense reserve development up to $1.5 billion above the company's net asbestos and environmental reserves recorded as of december 31, 2016. as of december 31, 2017, the company has incurred $285 in adverse development on asbestos and environmental reserves that have been ceded under the adc treaty with nico, leaving approximately $1.2 billion of coverage available for future adverse net reserve development, if any. for additional information related to the adverse development cover, see note 8 - reinsurance and note 14 - commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements.
net and gross survival ratios net and gross survival ratios are a measure of the quotient of the carried reserves divided by average annual payments (net of reinsurance and on a gross basis) and is an indication of the number of years that carried reserves would last (i.e. survive) if future annual payments were consistent with the calculated historical average.
the survival ratios shown below are calculated for the one and three year periods ended december 31, 2017. the net basis survival ratio has been materially affected by the adverse development cover entered into between the company and nico. the company cedes adverse asbestos and environmental development in excess of its december 31, 2016 net carried reserves of $1.7 billion to nico up to a limit of $1.5 billion. since december 31, 2016, net reserves for asbestos and environmental have been declining as the company has had no net incurred losses but continues to pay down net loss reserves. as a result, this has the effect of reducing the one- and three-year net survival ratios shown in the table below. for asbestos, the table also presents the net survival ratios excluding the effect of the ppg settlement in 2016. see section that follows entitled major categories of asbestos accounts for discussion of the ppg settlement.

annual reserve reviews review of asbestos reserves beginning in 2017, the company performs its regular comprehensive annual review of asbestos reserves in the fourth quarter. as part of this evaluation in the fourth quarter of 2017, the company reviewed all of its open direct domestic insurance accounts exposed to asbestos liability, as well as assumed reinsurance accounts.
as a result of the 2017 fourth quarter review, the company increased estimated reserves before nico reinsurance by $183, primarily due to mesothelioma claim filings not declining as expected, unfavorable developments in coverage law in some jurisdictions and continued filings in specific, adverse jurisdictions. an increased share of adverse development from the fourth quarter review is from umbrella and excess policies in the 1981-1985 policy years. this increase in reserves was offset by a $183 reinsurance recoverable under the nico treaty.
during the 2016 second quarter review, a substantial majority of the company's direct accounts trended as expected, and the company observed no material changes in the underlying legal environment. however, mesothelioma claims filings have not declined as expected for a small subset of peripheral defendants with a high concentration of asbestos filings in specific, adverse jurisdictions. as a result, aggregate indemnity and defense costs did not decline as expected. while the mesothelioma and adverse jurisdiction claim trends observed in the 2016 comprehensive annual review were similar to the 2015 comprehensive annual review, most of the defendants that had reserve increases in the
58

2016 review did not have a material impact in the 2015 review. based on this evaluation, the company increased its net asbestos reserves for prior year development by $197 in second quarter 2016.
during the 2015 comprehensive annual review, the company found a substantial majority of direct accounts trended as expected, and the company saw no material changes in the underlying legal environment during the past year. however, a small percentage of the company's direct accounts experienced greater than expected claim filings, including mesothelioma claims. this was driven by a subset of peripheral defendants with a high concentration of filings in specific, adverse jurisdictions. as a result, the aggregate indemnity and defense costs did not decline as expected. to a lesser degree, the company also saw unfavorable development on certain assumed reinsurance accounts, driven by various account-specific factors, including filing activity experienced by the direct accounts. based on this evaluation, the company increased its net asbestos reserves for prior year development by $146 in second quarter 2015.
review of environmental reserves beginning in 2017, the company performs its regular comprehensive annual review of environmental reserves in the fourth quarter. as part of its evaluation in the fourth quarter of 2017, the company reviewed all of its open direct domestic insurance accounts exposed to environmental liability, as well as assumed reinsurance accounts.
as a result of the 2017 comprehensive annual review, the company increased estimated reserves before nico reinsurance by $102. this increase was offset by a reinsurance recoverable of $102 under the nico cover. a substantial majority of the company's direct environmental accounts trended as expected. however, a small percentage of the company's direct accounts exhibited deterioration due to increased clean-up costs and liability shares associated with superfund sites and sediment in waterways, as well as adverse legal rulings, most notably from jurisdictions in the pacific northwest.
during the 2016 comprehensive annual review, a substantial majority of the company's direct environmental accounts trended as expected. however, a small percentage of the company's direct accounts exhibited deterioration associated with the tendering of new sites for coverage, increased defense costs stemming from individual bodily injury liability suits, and increased clean-up costs associated with waterways. based on this evaluation, the company increased its net environmental reserves for prior year development by $71 in second quarter 2016.
during the 2015 comprehensive annual review, a substantial majority of the company's environmental exposures trended as expected, however the company found loss and expense estimates for certain individual account exposures increased based upon an increase in clean-up costs, including at a handful of superfund sites. in addition, new claim severity deteriorated, although frequency continued to decline as expected. the net effect of these account-specific changes as well as quarterly actuarial evaluations of new account emergence and historical loss and expense paid experience resulted in an increase of $57 in net environmental reserves for prior years development.
major categories of asbestos accounts direct asbestos exposures include both known and unallocated direct accounts.
•   known direct accounts- includes both major asbestos defendants and non-major accounts, and represent approximately 63% of the company's total direct gross asbestos reserves as of december 31, 2017 compared to approximately 61% as of june 30, 2016. major asbestos defendants have been defined as the "top 70" accounts in tillinghast's published tiers 1 and 2 and wellington accounts, while non-major accounts are comprised of all other direct asbestos accounts and largely represent smaller and more peripheral defendants. major asbestos defendants have the fewest number of asbestos accounts and up through second quarter 2016 had included reserves related to ppg industries, inc. ("ppg"). in may 2016, the company pre-paid its funding obligation in the amount of $315 as permitted under the settlement agreement, arising from participation in a 2002 settlement of asbestos liabilities of ppg. the company's funding obligation approximated the amount reserved for this exposure.
•   unallocated direct accounts- includes an estimate of the reserves necessary for asbestos claims related to direct insureds that have not previously tendered asbestos claims to the company and exposures related to liability claims that may not be subject to an aggregate limit under the applicable policies. these exposures represent approximately 37% of the company's direct gross asbestos reserves as of december 31, 2017 compared to approximately 39% as of june 30, 2016.
review of "all other" reserves in property & casualty other operations in the fourth quarters of 2017, 2016 and 2015, the company completed evaluations of certain of its non-asbestos and non-environmental reserves in property & casualty other operations, including its assumed reinsurance liabilities, unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves, and allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. overall prior year development on all other reserves was immaterial with reserves increasing (decreasing) by $18, ($20), and $29 respectively for calendar years 2017, 2016 and 2015.
the company provides an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, reflecting management's best estimate of reinsurance cessions that may be uncollectible in the future due to reinsurers' unwillingness or inability to pay. during the fourth quarter of 2017, and second quarters of 2016 and 2015, the company completed its annual evaluations of the collectibility of the reinsurance recoverables and the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance associated with older, long-term casualty liabilities reported in property & casualty other operations. in conducting these evaluations, the company used its most recent detailed evaluations of ceded liabilities reported in the segment. the company analyzed the overall credit quality of the company's reinsurers, recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers and recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants. the evaluations in the fourth quarter of 2017, and second quarters of 2016 and 2015, resulted in no material adjustments to the property & casualty other operations' overall ceded reinsurance reserves, including the
59
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. as of december 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance for property & casualty other operations totaled $86, $136, and $220 respectively. reductions in the allowance since 2015 are primarily the result of actuarial reserve evaluations that have given greater weight to favorable collectibility experience in recent calendar year periods in estimating future collections, and to a lesser extent impacts from the sale of the company's uk p&c run-off subsidiaries in 2017. due to the inherent uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before reinsurance recoverables become due, particularly for older, long-term casualty liabilities, it is possible that future adjustments to the company's reinsurance recoverables, net of the allowance, could be required.
impact of re-estimates on property and casualty insurance product reserves estimating property and casualty insurance product reserves uses a variety of methods, assumptions and data elements.
ultimate losses may vary materially from the current estimates. many factors can contribute to these variations and the need to change the previous estimate of required reserve levels. prior accident year reserve development is generally due to the emergence of additional facts that were not known or anticipated at the time of the prior reserve estimate and/or due to changes in interpretations of information and trends.
the table below shows the range of annual reserve re-estimates experienced by the hartford over the past ten years. the amount of prior accident year development (as shown in the reserve roll-forward) for a given calendar year is expressed as a percent of the beginning calendar year reserves, net of reinsurance. the ranges presented are significantly influenced by the facts and circumstances of each particular year and by the fact that only the last ten years are included in the range. accordingly, these percentages are not intended to be a prediction of the range of possible future variability. for further discussion of the potential for variability in recorded loss reserves, see preferred reserving methods by line of business - impact of changes in key assumptions on reserve volatility section.

the potential variability of the company's property and casualty insurance product reserves would normally be expected to vary by segment and the types of loss exposures insured by those segments. illustrative factors influencing the potential reserve variability for each of the segments are discussed under critical accounting estimates for property & casualty insurance product reserves and asbestos and environmental reserves. see the section entitled property & casualty other operations, annual reserve reviews about the impact that the adc retroactive reinsurance agreement with nico may have on net reserve changes of asbestos and environmental reserves going forward.
the following table summarizes the effect of reserve re-estimates, net of reinsurance, on calendar year operations for the ten-year period ended december 31, 2017. the total of each column details the amount of reserve re-estimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the re-estimates are applicable. the amounts in the total column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve re-estimates during the ten year period ended december 31, 2017 for the indicated accident year in each row.

accident years 2007 and prior the net reserve re-estimates for accident years 2006 and prior are driven mostly by increased reserves for asbestos and environmental reserves, and also for increased estimates on assumed casualty reinsurance, workers' compensation and general liability claims.
partially offsetting reserve increases for accident years 2007 and prior was favorable development mainly related to workers' compensation claims, driven, in part, by state regulatory reforms in california and florida, underwriting actions and expense reduction initiatives. additionally, reserves for professional liability were reduced due to a lower estimate of claim severity in both directors' and officers' and errors and omissions insurance claims. reserves for personal automobile liability claims were reduced largely due to improvement in emerged claim severity.
accident years 2008 and 2009
estimates of ultimate losses have emerged favorably for accident years 2008 and 2009 mainly related to personal automobile liability.
accident years 2010 and 2011
unfavorable reserve re-estimates on accident years 2010 and 2011 were primarily related to workers' compensation and commercial automobile liability. workers' compensation loss cost trends were higher than initially expected as an increase in frequency outpaced a moderation of severity trends. unfavorable commercial automobile liability reserve re-estimates were driven by higher frequency of large loss bodily injury claims.
accident years 2012 and 2013
estimates of ultimate unpaid losses were decreased for accident years 2012 and 2013 due to favorable frequency and/or medical severity trends for workers' compensation, favorable professional liability claim emergence, and lower frequency of late emerging general liability claims for the 2012 accident year. favorable emergence of property lines of business, including catastrophes, for the 2013 accident year, is partially offset by increased reserves in automobile liability due to increased severity of large claims.
accident years 2014 and 2015
reserve changes for accident years 2014 and 2015 were largely driven by unfavorable frequency and severity trends for personal and commercial automobile liability and increased severity of liability claims on package business, offset by favorable frequency and medical severity trends for workers' compensation.
accident year 2016
reserves were decreased for the 2016 accident year largely due to reserve decreases on short-tail lines of business, where results emerge more quickly.
group benefit long-term disability ("ltd") reserves, net of reinsurance the company establishes reserves for group life and accident & health contracts, including long-term disability coverage, for both outstanding reported claims and claims related to insured events that the company estimates have been incurred but have not yet been reported. these reserve estimates can change over time based on facts and interpretations of circumstances, and consideration of various internal factors including the hartford's experience with similar cases, claim payment patterns, loss control programs and mix of business. in addition, the reserve estimates are influenced by various external factors including court decisions and economic conditions. the effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process. long-tail claim liabilities are discounted because the payment pattern and the ultimate costs are reasonably fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. the majority of group benefits' reserves are for ltd claimants who are known to be disabled and are currently receiving benefits. the company held $6,807 and $4,687 of ltd unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance, as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, with the increase from 2016 to 2017 largely due to the acquisition of aetna's u.s. group life and disability business.
61
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reserving methodology how reserves are set - a disabled life reserve (dlr) is calculated for each ltd claim. the dlr for each claim is the expected present value of all future benefit payments starting with the known monthly gross benefit which is reduced for estimates of the expected claim recovery due to return to work or claimant death, offsets from other income including offsets from social security benefits, and discounting where the discount rate is tied to expected investment yield at the time the claim is incurred. estimated future benefit payments represent the monthly income benefit that is paid until recovery, death or expiration of benefits. claim recoveries are estimated based on claim characteristics such as age and diagnosis and represent an estimate of benefits that will terminate, generally as a result of the claimant returning to work or being deemed able to return to work. for claims recently closed due to recovery, a portion of the dlr is retained for the possibility that the claim reopens upon further evidence of disability.  in addition, a reserve for estimated unpaid claim expenses is included in the dlr.
the dlr also includes a liability for potential payments to pending claimants who have not yet been approved for ltd either because they have not yet satisfied the waiting (or elimination) period or because the approval or denial decision has not yet been made. in these cases, the present value of future benefits is reduced for the likelihood of recovery before benefit onset or claim denial based on company experience. for claims recently closed due to denial, a portion of the dlr is retained for the possibility that the claim is later approved upon further evidence of disability.
estimates for incurred but not reported (ibnr) claims are made by applying completion factors to the dollar amount of claims reported or expected depending on the reporting segment. completion factors are derived from standard actuarial techniques using triangles that display historical claim count emergence by incurral month. these estimates are reviewed for reasonableness and are adjusted for current trends and other factors expected to cause a change in claim emergence. the reserves include an estimate of unpaid claim expenses, including a provision for the cost of initial set-up of the claim once reported.
for all products, including ltd, there is a period generally ranging from two to twelve months, depending on the product and reporting segment, where emerged claims for an incurral year are not yet credible enough to be a basis for estimating reserves.  in these cases, the ultimate loss is estimated using earned premium multiplied by an expected loss ratio based on pricing assumptions of claim incidence, claim severity, and earned pricing.
current trends contributing to reserve uncertainty in group insurance, long-term disability (ltd) has the longest pattern of loss emergence and the highest reserve amount. one significant risk to the reserve would be a slowdown in recoveries. in particular, the economic environment can affect the ability of a disabled employee to return-to-work and the length of time an employee receives disability benefits. another significant risk is a change in benefit offsets. often the company pays a reduced benefit due to offsets from other income sources such as pensions or social security disability insurance (ssdi). possible changes to the frequency, timing, or amount of offsets, such as a change in ssdi approval standards or benefit offerings, create a risk that the amount to settle open claims will exceed initial estimates. since the monthly income benefit for a claimant is established based on the individual's salary at the time of disability and the level of coverages and benefits provided, inflation is not considered a significant risk to the reserve estimate. few of the company's ltd policies provide for cost of living adjustments to the monthly income benefit.
impact of key assumptions on reserves the key assumptions affecting our group life and accident & health reserves include:
discount rate - the discount rate is the interest rate at which expected future claim cash flows are discounted to determine the present value. a higher selected discount rate results in a lower reserve. if the discount rate is higher than our future investment returns, our invested assets will not earn enough investment income to cover the discount accretion on our claim reserves which would negatively affect our profit. for each incurral year, the discount rates are estimated based on investment yields expected to be earned net of investment expenses. the incurral year is the year in which the claim is incurred and the estimated settlement pattern is determined. once established, discount rates for each incurral year are unchanged except that ltd reserves assumed from the acquisition of aetna's u.s. group life and disability business are all discounted using current rates as of the november 1, 2017 acquisition date. the weighted average discount rate on ltd reserves was 3.5% and 4.3% in 2017 and 2016, respectively, with the decrease from 2016 to 2017 largely due to aetna u.s. group life and disability business ltd reserves being discounted at current rates as of the acquisition date. had the discount rate for each incurral year been 10 basis points lower at the time they were established, our group benefits unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves would be higher by $34, pretax, as of december 31, 2017.
claim termination rates (inclusive of mortality, recoveries, and expiration of benefits) - claim termination rates are an estimate of the rate at which claimants will cease receiving benefits during a given calendar year. terminations result from a number of factors, including death, recoveries and expiration of benefits. the probability that benefits will terminate in each future month for each claim is estimated using a predictive model that uses past company experience, contract provisions, job characteristics and other claimant-specific characteristics such as diagnosis, time since disability began, and age.  actual claim termination experience will vary from period to period. over the past 10 years, claim termination rates for a single incurral year have generally increased and have ranged from 7% below to 8% above current assumptions over that time period.  for a single recent incurral year (such as 2017), a one percent decrease in our assumption for ltd claim termination rates would increase our reserves by $7. for all incurral years combined, as of december 31, 2017, a one percent decrease in our assumption for our ltd claim termination rates would increase our group benefits unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense reserves by $20.

part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations evaluation of goodwill for impairment goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event for a potential impairment has occurred. the goodwill impairment test follows a two-step process. in the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment. in the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the goodwill carrying value.
the estimated fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs into discounted cash flow calculations including assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit. assumptions include levels of economic capital, future business growth, earnings projections, assets under management for mutual funds, and the weighted average cost of capital used for purposes of discounting. decreases in business growth, decreases in earnings projections and increases in the weighted average cost of capital will all cause a reporting unit's fair value to decrease, increasing the possibility of impairment.
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. the company's reporting units, for which goodwill has been allocated include small commercial within the commercial lines segment, group benefits, personal lines and mutual funds.
the carrying value of goodwill is $1,290 as of december 31, 2017 and is comprised of $38 for small commercial, $272 for mutual funds, $861 for group benefits and $119 for personal lines.
the annual goodwill assessment for the small commercial, mutual funds, group benefits and personal lines reporting units was completed as of october 31, 2017, and resulted in no write-downs of goodwill for the year ended december 31, 2017. all reporting units passed the first step of the annual impairment test with a significant margin. for information regarding the 2016 and 2015 impairment tests see note 10 -goodwill & other intangible assets of notes to consolidated financial statements.
valuation of investments and derivative instruments fixed maturities, equity securities, short-term investments and free-standing derivatives the company generally determines fair values using valuation techniques that use prices, rates, and other relevant information evident from market transactions involving identical or similar instruments. valuation techniques also include, where appropriate, estimates of future cash flows that are converted into a single discounted amount using current market expectations. the company uses a "waterfall" approach comprised of the following pricing sources which are listed in priority order: quoted prices, prices from third-party pricing services, internal matrix pricing, and independent broker quotes. the fair value of free-standing derivative instruments are determined primarily using a discounted cash flow model or option model technique and incorporate counterparty credit risk. in some cases, quoted market prices for exchange-traded transactions and transactions cleared through central clearing houses ("otc-cleared") may be used and in other cases independent broker quotes may be used. for further discussion, see the fixed maturities, equity securities, short-term investments and free-standing derivatives section in note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
evaluation of otti on available-for-sale securities and valuation allowances on mortgage loans each quarter, a committee of investment and accounting professionals evaluates investments to determine if an other-than-temporary impairment ("impairment") is present for afs securities or a valuation allowance is required for mortgage loans. this evaluation is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties. for further discussion of the accounting policies, see the significant investment accounting policies section in note 1 - basis of presentation and significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements. for a discussion of impairments recorded, see the other-than-temporary impairments within the investment portfolio risks and risk management section of the md&a.
valuation allowance on deferred tax assets deferred tax assets represent the tax benefit of future deductible temporary differences and certain tax carryforwards. deferred tax assets are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such benefits are realized if there is no change in tax law. under u.s. gaap, we test the value of deferred tax assets for impairment on a quarterly basis at the entity level within each tax jurisdiction, consistent with our filed tax returns. deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the determination of the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions. in evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets, we have considered all available evidence as of december 31, 2017, including past operating results, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. in the event we determine it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an increase to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. likewise, if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets would be realized, the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. our judgments and assumptions are subject to change given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future performance and specific industry and investment market conditions.
as of december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, the company had no valuation allowance. the reduction in the valuation allowance in 2016 stems primarily from taxable gains on the

part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations termination of derivatives during the period. the company had no capital loss carryovers as of december 31, 2017. as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act ("tax reform") enacted by the federal government on december 22, 2017, the company reclassified amt credits of $790, net of a sequestration fee payable, from deferred taxes to a current income tax receivable since the law allows for the refund of amt credits over time but no later than 2022. for additional information about tax reform, see note - 16, income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements.
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considered future taxable temporary difference reversals, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryovers, taxable income in open carry back years and other tax planning strategies. from time to time, tax planning strategies could include holding a portion of debt securities with market value losses until recovery, altering the level of tax exempt securities held, making investments which have specific tax characteristics, and business considerations such as asset-liability matching. management views such tax planning strategies as prudent and feasible, and would implement them, if necessary, to realize the deferred tax assets.
contingencies relating to corporate litigation and regulatory matters management evaluates each contingent matter separately. a loss is recorded if probable and reasonably estimable. management establishes reserves for these contingencies at its "best estimate," or, if no one number within the range of possible losses is more probable than any other, the company records an estimated reserve at the low end of the range of losses.
the company has a quarterly monitoring process involving legal and accounting professionals. legal personnel first identify outstanding corporate litigation and regulatory matters posing a reasonable possibility of loss. these matters are then jointly reviewed by accounting and legal personnel to evaluate the facts and changes since the last review in order to determine if a provision for loss should be recorded or adjusted, the amount that should be recorded, and the appropriate disclosure. the outcomes of certain contingencies currently being evaluated by the company, which relate to corporate litigation and regulatory matters, are inherently difficult to predict, and the reserves that have been established for the estimated settlement amounts are subject to significant changes. management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such lawsuits, after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses, will not be material to the consolidated financial condition of the company. in view of the uncertainties regarding the outcome of these matters, as well as the tax-deductibility of payments, it is possible that the ultimate cost to the company of these matters could exceed the reserve by an amount that would have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated results of operations and liquidity in a particular quarterly or annual period.

2018 outlook the company expects higher commercial lines written premiums in 2018, driven by increases across small commercial, middle market and specialty commercial, reflecting a mix of expected continued economic growth, distribution expansion, and the effect of competitive conditions on written pricing. management expects the written premium increases will be driven by higher new business, partially offset by lower renewal premium. in workers' compensation, market conditions are expected to put downward pressure on rates and increase competition for new business.  in auto, profit improvement initiatives will drive lower retention, partially offset by higher written pricing. pricing varies significantly by product line with mid-single digit pricing increases expected in property and general liability and higher written pricing increases expected in commercial automobile. in workers' compensation, given favorable profitability trends, rates are expected to be flat to declining.
the company expects the commercial lines combined ratio will be between approximately 93.0 and 95.5 for 2018, compared to 97.3 in 2017, largely due to higher catastrophe losses incurred in 2017. the underlying combined ratio is expected to decrease slightly due to the effect of continued earned pricing increases and moderate average claim severity, but the improvement is subject to changes in market pricing and loss cost trends. current accident year catastrophes are assumed to be 2.6 points of the combined ratio in 2018 compared to 5.6 points in 2017.
net income year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016
net income decreased in 2017 due to a lower underwriting gain, partially offset by increases in net investment income and net realized capital gains. for further discussion of investment results, see md&a - investment results, net investment income (loss).
year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
net income increased in 2016 primarily due to a shift to net realized capital gains in the current year from net realized capital losses in the prior year and higher net investment income.
underwriting gain year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016
underwriting gain decreased in 2017 primarily due to higher catastrophe losses and higher underwriting expenses largely driven by an increase in variable incentive compensation and higher it costs. also contributing to the decrease were higher current accident year loss costs for workers' compensation, general liability and non-catastrophe property, offset by the effect of earned premium growth and a change from unfavorable prior accident year development in 2016 to favorable development in 2017.

part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
underwriting gain decreased slightly driven by higher losses and loss adjustment expenses and higher underwriting expenses, partially offset by earned premium growth.
earned premiums

year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016
earned premiums increased in 2017 reflecting written premium growth over the preceding twelve months.
written premiums increased in 2017 primarily due to growth in small commercial.
•   small commercial written premium growth for 2017 was primarily due to higher renewal premium driven by renewal written price increases and growth from the acquisition of maxum, partially offset by lower new business premium, excluding maxum, and the effect of lower policy retention.
•   middle market written premiums in 2017 were up modestly as higher new and renewal premium was partially offset by modestly higher property reinsurance costs.
•   specialty commercial written premiums in 2017 were up slightly as growth in bond was largely offset by new business declines in national accounts.
year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
earned premiums increased in 2016 reflecting written premium growth over the preceding twelve months.
written premiums increased in 2016 due to growth in small commercial. renewal written pricing increases and policy retention for standard commercial lines were both unchanged in 2016 compared to 2015.
•   small commercial increased primarily due to workers' compensation driven by higher new business, renewal and audit premium, and spectrum package business driven by higher renewal premium, as well as the acquisition of maxum.
•   the decrease in middle market was driven primarily by lower new business, renewal and endorsement premium in workers' compensation, and lower new business and renewal premium in general liability and specialty programs, partially offset by higher new business and renewal premium in construction.
•   specialty commercial decreased primarily as a result of lower retrospective premium on loss sensitive business in national accounts.
•   renewal written pricing increases averaged 2% in standard commercial, which included 3% for small commercial and 1% for middle market.

part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016
loss and lae ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development increased in 2017, primarily due to a higher loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in both workers' compensation and general liability, as well as higher commercial property losses in middle market. the workers' compensation current accident year loss ratio deteriorated from 2016 to 2017 as increases in average claim severity outpaced the effect of earned pricing and a modest reduction in loss cost frequency.
year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
loss and lae ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development decreased in 2016, as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to a lower loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in workers' compensation, driven by favorable frequency, partially offset by a higher loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in commercial automobile, driven by elevated frequency and severity.
catastrophes and prior accident year development year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016
current accident year catastrophe losses for 2017 were primarily from hurricanes harvey and irma as well as from wind and hail events in the midwest, texas and colorado. catastrophe losses for 2016 were primarily due to wind and hail events and winter storms across various u.s. geographic regions.
prior accident year development was favorable in 2017 compared to unfavorable prior accident year development in 2016. net reserve decreases for 2017 were primarily related to reduced loss reserve estimates for workers' compensation and small commercial package business, partially offset by reserves increases for bond.
year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
current accident year catastrophe losses totaled $200, before tax, in 2016, compared to $121, before tax, in 2015. catastrophe losses for both years were primarily due to wind and hail events and winter storms across various u.s. geographic regions.
prior accident year development of $28, before tax, was unfavorable in 2016, compared to unfavorable prior accident year development of $53, before tax, in 2015. net reserve increases in 2016 were primarily related to package business, general liability and commercial automobile liability, largely offset by a decrease in reserves for workers' compensation, professional liability and uncollectible reinsurance.

2018 outlook in 2018, the company expects the rate of pricing increases for automobile and homeowners across the industry to decrease slightly, as loss cost trends have moderated. accordingly, the company expects written pricing increases in 2018 for both automobile and homeowners to be in the high single-digits, slightly below written pricing increases for 2017. management expects continued automobile profitability improvement in 2018 as loss cost frequency and severity have moderated and the book of business continues to benefit from earned pricing increases. while the company will continue to execute on multiple profitability improvement initiatives in personal automobile in 2018, the company also plans to drive new business growth in select states, particularly in the direct channel. due to those actions, the company expects a low-single digit decline in personal lines written premiums in 2018, with aarp direct premiums expected to be flat to slightly higher and aarp agency and other agency premium expected to decline.
the company expects the combined ratio for personal lines will be between approximately 96.0 and 98.0 for 2018 compared to 104.2 in 2017, primarily due to lower current accident year catastrophes and continued improvement in the underlying automobile loss ratio. current accident year catastrophes are

part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations assumed to be 5.6 points of the combined ratio in 2018 compared to 12.3 points in 2017. for automobile, we expect that management actions, including the effect of earned pricing, will exceed an expected increase in loss cost severity and higher direct marketing expenses, resulting in a lower underlying combined ratio. the underlying combined ratio for homeowners is expected to remain relatively flat in 2018, driven by earned pricing increases, offset by increased average claim severity and higher expenses.
net (loss) income year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016
net loss in 2017 was unchanged from 2016 as lower underwriting loss and higher net realized capital gains was offset by $33 of income tax expense arising primarily from the reduction of net deferred tax assets due to the enactment of lower federal income tax rates.
year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
net loss in 2016 compared to net income in 2015 primarily due to a change from underwriting gain to underwriting loss.
underwriting (loss) gain year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016
underwriting loss decreased in 2017 primarily due a change from unfavorable prior accident year development in 2016 to favorable development in 2017 and lower current accident year loss costs in both auto and homeowners, partially offset by higher current accident year catastrophe losses. the decrease in underwriting expenses was primarily due to lower marketing and operations costs, partially offset by higher variable incentive compensation and the decrease in dac amortization was driven primarily by lower agency commissions.
year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
underwriting loss in 2016 compared to an underwriting gain in 2015 primarily due to an increase in automobile liability loss costs, with higher current accident year loss and loss adjustment expenses and more unfavorable prior accident year reserve development, principally related to the 2015 accident year. the increase in automobile loss costs was partially offset by lower direct marketing expenses.
earned premiums year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016
earned premiums decreased in 2017, reflecting a decline in written premium over the prior six to twelve months in the other agency channel and, to a lesser extent, in aarp direct.
written premiums decreased in 2017 in aarp direct and both agency channels primarily due to a decline in new business and lower policy count retention in both automobile and homeowners partially offset by the effect of renewal written price increases.
renewal written pricing increases were higher in 2017 in both automobile and home, as the company increased rates to improve profitability.
policy count retention decreased in 2017 in both automobile and homeowners, driven in part by renewal written pricing increases.

loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development decreased in 2017, primarily as a result of lower automobile liability and auto physical damage frequency and lower non-catastrophe weather-related homeowners losses and the effect of earned pricing increases.
year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development increased primarily as a result of higher automobile liability frequency and severity, partially offset by the effect of increases in earned pricing.
catastrophes and prior accident year development year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016
current accident year catastrophe losses for 2017 were primarily due to hurricanes harvey and irma and wildfires in california as well as multiple wind and hail events across various u.s. geographic regions, concentrated in texas, colorado, the midwest and the southeast. catastrophe losses for 2016 were primarily due to multiple wind and hail events across various u.s. geographic regions, concentrated in the midwest and central plains.
prior accident year development was favorable for 2017 compared to unfavorable prior accident year development for 2016. net reserves decreased in 2017 primarily due to decreases in reserves for prior accident year catastrophes and homeowners.
72
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
current accident year catastrophe losses of $216, before tax, in 2016 increased compared to $211, before tax, in 2015. catastrophe losses in 2016 were primarily due to multiple wind and hail events across various u.s. geographic regions, concentrated in the midwest and central plains. catastrophe losses in 2015 were primarily due to wildfires in california and multiple events (wind and hail primarily) across various u.s. geographic regions.
prior accident year development of $151, before tax, was unfavorable in 2016, compared to favorable prior accident year development of $21, before tax, in 2015. net reserves increased for 2016 primarily due to increased bodily injury frequency and severity for the 2015 accident year and increased bodily injury severity for the 2014 accident year. net reserves decreased for 2015 primarily due to accident year 2014 catastrophes.

part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations net income (loss)
year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016
net income (loss) improved from a net loss of $529 to net income of $69 primarily due to losses in 2016, including a loss on reinsurance transaction for premium paid to nico covering adverse reserve development of asbestos and environmental reserves after 2016, as well adverse development in 2016 due to the second quarter study of asbestos and environmental reserves.
year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
net loss increased in 2016 primarily due to a $423 after-tax loss on the reinsurance transaction that cedes adverse development on asbestos and environmental reserves and higher unfavorable net asbestos and environmental prior accident year development associated with the company's comprehensive annual review. net realized capital losses before tax in 2016 included an $81 estimated capital loss on the pending sale of the company's u.k. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries. net of tax benefits, the pending sale resulted in an estimated after-tax loss of $5.
pre-tax charge for asbestos and environmental reserve increases year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016
asbestos reserves were virtually unchanged in 2017 as a $183 increase in estimated reserves before nico reinsurance was offset by $183 of losses recoverable under the nico treaty. the increase in reserves before nico reinsurance was primarily due to mesothelioma claim filings not declining as expected, unfavorable developments in coverage law in some jurisdictions and continued filings in specific, adverse jurisdictions. an increased share of adverse development from the fourth quarter review is from umbrella and excess policies in the 1981-1985 policy years.
environmental reserves were unchanged in 2017 as a $102 increase in estimated reserves before nico reinsurance was offset by $102 of loss recoverable under the nico treaty. the increase in reserves before nico reinsurance was primarily due to increased clean-up costs and liability shares associated with superfund sites and sediment in waterways, as well as adverse legal rulings, most notably from jurisdictions in the pacific northwest.
year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
asbestos reserves increased by $197 in 2016 arising from the second quarter reserve study which found that mesothelioma claims filings have not declined as expected in specific, adverse jurisdictions. as a result, aggregate indemnity and defense costs have not declined as expected resulting in unfavorable net asbestos reserve development.
environmental reserves increased by $71 in 2016  primarily due to deterioration associated with the tendering of new sites for policy coverage, increased defense costs stemming from individual bodily injury liability suits, and increased clean-up costs associated with waterways.

net income increased in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to $52 of income tax benefits arising primarily from the reduction of net deferred tax liabilities due to the enactment of lower federal income tax rates. in addition, net income increased as a result of growth in premiums and other considerations and a lower group disability loss ratio, partially offset by an increase in insurance operating costs and other expenses due, in part, to higher variable incentive compensation as well as integration and transaction costs related to the acquisition of aetna's u.s. group life and disability business. insurance operating costs and other expenses in 2017 also included state guaranty fund assessments of $20 before tax related to the liquidation of a life and health insurance company. the acquisition of aetna's u.s. group life and disability business, which closed on november 1, 2017, did not have a material impact on results in 2017.
insurance operating costs and other expenses increased 18%, primarily due to the inclusion of two months of expenses for the acquired aetna's u.s. group life and disability business, state guaranty fund assessments of $20 before tax related to the liquidation of a life and health insurance company and an increase in variable incentive compensation.
year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
net income increased in 2016 primarily due to higher net realized capital gains, higher premiums and other considerations and lower insurance operating costs and other expenses, partially offset by higher benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses.
insurance operating costs and other expenses decreased 2% due primarily to decreased administrative expenses.
fully insured ongoing premiums year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016
fully insured ongoing premiums increased in 2017, in part, because it included two months of premiums for the acquired aetna's u.s. group life and disability business. excluding the impact of the acquisition, fully insured ongoing premiums increased 3% due to sales, strong persistency and modest group disability pricing increases.
fully insured ongoing sales, excluding buyouts were essentially flat to prior year reflecting higher group disability sales offset by lower group life and other sales.
year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
fully insured ongoing premiums increased 2% due to strong persistency and pricing increases.
fully insured ongoing sales, excluding buyouts decreased 4% in 2016, reflecting lower disability sales.

part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ratios year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016
total loss ratio decreased 1.9 points, primarily due to a lower group disability loss ratio. the group disability loss ratio decreased 4.9 points, driven by continued improvements in incidence trends, higher recoveries and modest pricing increases. the group life loss ratio increased 1.0 points, primarily driven by favorable changes in reserve estimates of 1.3 points in 2016 partially offset by favorable mortality in the current year.
expense ratio increased 0.6 points primarily due to state guaranty fund assessments related to the liquidation of a life and health insurance company, an increase in variable incentive compensation and amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of aetna's u.s. group life and disability business. integration and transaction costs of $17 in 2017 related to the acquisition are not included in the expense ratio.
year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
total loss ratio increased 0.6 points in 2016 to 78.0% due to a higher group life loss ratio. the group life loss ratio increased 1.0 point due to higher severity in 2016. included in the life loss ratio were favorable changes in reserve estimates of 1.3 points in 2016. the group disability loss ratio decreased 0.2 points primarily driven by increased pricing and improved incidence trends, partially offset by an increase in long-term disability claim severity. included in the disability loss ratio were favorable changes in long-term disability reserve estimates of 0.4 points compared to 1.2 points in the prior year.
expense ratio improved 1.0 points in 2016, reflecting premium growth and lower insurance operating costs and other expenses.

2018 outlook the company expects to increase sales in 2018 from a diversified lineup of mutual funds and etps. assuming markets continue to grow, the company expects assets under management and earnings growth in 2018 provided the company continues delivering strong fund performance and generates positive net flows. the growth in assets under management and earnings will be partially offset by the continued run off of the life and annuity business held for sale. after the sale of the life and annuity run-off business, which is expected to close by june 30, 2018, the mutual funds segment expects to continue to manage the mutual fund assets of that business.

part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations net (loss) income year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016
net loss increased primarily due to a $3.3 billion estimated loss on sale of the life and annuity run-off business, $867 of income tax expense arising primarily from the reduction of net deferred tax assets due to the enactment of lower federal income tax rates and a $488 after-tax pension settlement charge.
insurance operating costs and other expenses decreased in 2017 largely due to lower centralized services costs and lower estimated state income tax expense. upon reporting the life and annuity run-off business as discontinued operations, centralized services costs were reallocated to corporate for all periods presented and those reallocated costs declined from 2016 to 2017 principally due to a lower allocation of it costs.
income (loss) from discontinued operations income (loss) from discontinued operations decreased from income of $283 in 2016 to a net loss of $2.9 billion in 2017 with the net loss in 2017 due to a loss on sale of the company's life and annuity run-off business of $3.3 billion, partially offset by operating income from discontinued operations of $388. operating income from discontinued operations increased from $283 in 2016 primarily due to lower net realized capital losses in 2017. apart from the reduction in net realized capital losses, earnings were relatively flat as an increase in the assumption study benefit and lower interest credited were largely offset by lower net investment income and lower fee income due to the continued run-off of the variable annuity block.
year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
net income decreased primarily due to lower income from discontinued operations, net of tax, partially offset by a decrease in insurance operating costs and other expenses, an increase in net investment income and lower interest expense. the income tax benefit of $113 associated with the investments in solar energy partnerships was offset by realized capital losses of $96. before tax, associated with the write-down of investments in solar energy partnerships.
insurance operating costs and other expenses decreased in 2016 largely due a reduction in restructuring costs.
income (loss) from discontinued operations operating income from discontinued operations decreased from $486 in 2015 primarily due to lower tax benefits recognized in 2016, a write-off of dac associated with fixed annuities, lower investment income and a reinsurance gain on disposition in 2015. in addition, the continued run-off of the variable and fixed annuity block resulted in lower fee income, partially offset by lower amortization of dac and lower insurance operating costs and other expenses.
interest expense year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016
interest expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in outstanding debt due to debt maturities and the paydown of senior notes. since december 31, 2016, $416 of senior notes have either matured or been paid down.
year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015
interest expense decreased in 2016 primarily due to a decrease in outstanding debt from debt maturities and the paydown of senior notes. in 2016, $275 of senior notes matured.

the company manages and monitors risk through risk policies, controls and limits. at the senior management level, an enterprise risk and capital committee ("ercc") oversees the risk profile and risk management practices of the company. as illustrated below, a number of functional committees sit underneath the ercc, providing oversight of specific risk areas and recommending risk mitigation strategies to the ercc.
ercc members ceo (chair)
president chief financial officer chief investment officer chief risk officer general counsel others as deemed necessary by the committee chair ercc asset liability committee     underwriting risk committee     emerging risk steering committee      operational risk committee      catastrophe risk committee      economic capital executive committee      model oversight committee the company's enterprise risk management ("erm") function supports the ercc and functional committees, and is tasked with, among other things:
•   risk identification and assessment;
•   the development of risk appetites, tolerances, and limits;
•   risk monitoring; and
•   internal and external risk reporting.
the company categorizes its main risks as insurance risk, operational risk and financial risk, each of which is described in more detail below.
insurance risk insurance risk is the risk of losses of both a catastrophic and non-catastrophic nature on the p&c and life products the company has sold. catastrophe insurance risk is the exposure arising from both natural (e.g., weather, earthquakes, wildfires, pandemics) and man-made catastrophes (e.g., terrorism, cyber-attacks) that create a concentration or aggregation of loss across the company's insurance or asset portfolios.
sources of insurance risk non-catastrophe insurance risks exist within each of the company's divisions except mutual funds and include:
•   property- risk of loss to personal or commercial property from automobile related accidents, weather, explosions, smoke, shaking, fire, theft, vandalism, inadequate installation, faulty equipment, collisions and falling objects, and/or machinery mechanical breakdown resulting in physical damage and other covered perils.
•   liability- risk of loss from automobile related accidents, uninsured and underinsured drivers, lawsuits from accidents, defective products, breach of warranty, negligent acts by professional practitioners, environmental claims, latent exposures, fraud, coercion, forgery, failure to fulfill obligations per contract surety, liability from errors and omissions, derivative lawsuits, and other securities actions and covered perils.
•   mortality- risk of loss from unexpected trends in insured deaths impacting timing of payouts from life insurance, personal or commercial automobile related accidents, and death of employees or executives during the course of employment, while on disability, or while collecting workers compensation benefits.
•   morbidity- risk of loss to an insured from illness incurred during the course of employment or illness from other covered perils.
•   disability- risk of loss incurred from personal or commercial automobile related losses, accidents arising outside of the workplace, injuries or accidents incurred during the course of employment, or from equipment, with each loss resulting in short term or long-term disability payments.
•   longevity- risk of loss from increased life expectancy trends among policyholders receiving long-term benefit payments.
catastrophe risk primarily arises in the group life, group disability, property, and workers' compensation product lines.
impact non-catastrophe insurance risk can arise from unexpected loss experience, underpriced business and/or underestimation of loss reserves and can have significant effects on the company's earnings. catastrophe insurance risk can arise from various unpredictable events and can have significant

management the company's policies and procedures for managing these risks include disciplined underwriting protocols, exposure controls, sophisticated risk-based pricing, risk modeling, risk transfer, and capital management strategies. the company has established underwriting guidelines for both individual risks, including individual policy limits, and risks in the aggregate, including aggregate exposure limits by geographic zone and peril. the company uses both internal and third-party models to estimate the potential loss resulting from various catastrophe events and the potential financial impact those events would have on the company's financial position and results of operations across its businesses.
among specific risk tolerances set by the company, risk limits are set for natural catastrophes, terrorism risk and pandemic risk.
risk                  definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                          details and company limits natural catastrophe   exposure arising from natural phenomena (e.g., weather, earthquakes, wildfires, etc.) that create a concentration or aggregation of loss across the company's insurance or asset portfolios.                                        the company generally limits its estimated pre-tax loss as a result of natural catastrophes for property &amp; casualty exposures from a single 250-year event to less than 30% of statutory surplus of the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries prior to reinsurance and to less than 15% of statutory surplus of the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries after reinsurance. from time to time the estimated loss to natural catastrophes from a single 250-year event prior to reinsurance may fluctuate above or below these limits due to changes in modeled loss estimates, exposures or statutory surplus.
- the estimated 250 year pre-tax probable maximum loss from earthquake events is estimated to be $982 before reinsurance and $515 net of reinsurance. [1]
- the estimated 250 year pre-tax probable maximum losses from hurricane events are estimated to be $1.6 billion before reinsurance and $777 net of reinsurance. [1]
terrorism             the risk of losses from terrorist attacks, including losses caused by single-site and multi-site conventional attacks, as well as the potential for attacks using nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons ("nbcr").   enterprise limits for terrorism apply to aggregations of risk across property-casualty, group benefits and specific asset portfolios and are defined based on a deterministic, single-site conventional terrorism attack scenario. the company manages its potential estimated loss from a conventional terrorism loss scenario, up to $1.7 billion net of reinsurance and $2.0 billion gross of reinsurance, before coverage under the terrorism risk insurance program established under "tripra". in addition, the company monitors exposures monthly and employs both internally developed and vendor-licensed loss modeling tools as part of its risk management discipline. our modeled exposures to conventional terrorist attacks around landmark locations may fluctuate above and below our stated limits.
pandemic              the exposure to loss arising from widespread influenza or other pathogens or bacterial infections that create an aggregation of loss across the company's insurance or asset portfolios.                                            the company generally limits its estimated pre-tax loss from a single 250 year pandemic event to less than 15% of statutory surplus of the property and casualty and group benefits insurance subsidiaries. in evaluating these scenarios, the company assesses the impact on group life policies, short-term and long-term disability, property &amp; casualty claims, and losses in the investment portfolio associated with market declines in the event of a widespread pandemic. while erm has a process to track and manage these limits, from time to time, the estimated loss for pandemics may fluctuate above or below these limits due to changes in modeled loss estimates, exposures, or statutory surplus.
[1]   the loss estimates represent total property losses for hurricane events and property and workers compensation losses for earthquake events resulting from a single event. the estimates provided are based on 250-year return period loss estimates that have a 0.4% likelihood of being exceeded in any single year. the net loss estimates provided assume that the company is able to recover all losses ceded to reinsurers under its reinsurance programs. the company also manages natural catastrophe risk for group life and group disability, which in combination with property and workers compensation loss estimates are subject to separate enterprise risk management net aggregate loss limits as a percent of enterprise surplus.
reinsurance as a risk management strategy in addition to the policies and procedures outlined above, the company uses reinsurance to transfer certain risks to reinsurance companies based on specific geographic or risk concentrations. a variety of traditional reinsurance products are used as part of the company's risk management strategy, including excess of loss occurrence-based products that reinsure property and workers' compensation exposures, and individual risk or quota share arrangements, that reinsure losses from specific classes or lines of business. the company has no significant finite risk contracts in place and the statutory surplus benefit from all such prior year contracts is immaterial.
facultative reinsurance is used by the company to manage policy-specific risk exposures based on established underwriting guidelines. the hartford also participates in governmentally administered reinsurance facilities such as the florida hurricane catastrophe fund ("fhcf"), the terrorism risk insurance program established under "tripra" and other reinsurance programs relating to particular risks or specific lines of business.
reinsurance for catastrophes- the company has several catastrophe reinsurance programs, including reinsurance treaties that cover property and workers' compensation losses aggregating from single catastrophe events.

[1]   certain aspects of our principal catastrophe treaty have terms that extend beyond the traditional one year term. while the overall treaty is placed at 89%, each layer's placement varies slightly.
[2]   $100 of the property occurrence treaty can alternatively be used as part of the property aggregate treaty referenced below.
[3]   the per occurrence limit on the fhcf treaty is $102 for the 6/1/2017 to 6/1/2018 treaty year based on the company's election to purchase the required coverage from fhcf. coverage is based on the best available information from fhcf, which was updated in january 2018.
[4]   in addition to the limit shown, the workers compensation reinsurance includes a non-catastrophe, industrial accident layer, providing coverage for 80% of a $30 per event limit in excess of a $20 retention.
in addition to the property catastrophe reinsurance coverage described in the above table, the company has other catastrophe and working layer treaties and facultative reinsurance agreements that cover property catastrophe losses on an aggregate excess of loss and on a per risk basis. the principal property catastrophe reinsurance program and certain other reinsurance programs include a provision to reinstate limits in the event that a catastrophe loss exhausts limits on one or more layers under the treaties. in addition, covering the period from january 1, 2018 to december 31, 2018, the company has a property aggregate treaty in place which provides one limit of $200 of aggregate qualifying property catastrophe losses in excess of a net retention of $825.
reinsurance for terrorism- for the risk of terrorism, private sector catastrophe reinsurance capacity is generally limited and largely unavailable for terrorism losses caused by nbcr attacks. as such, the company's principal reinsurance protection against large-scale terrorist attacks is the coverage currently provided through tripra to the end of 2020.
tripra provides a backstop for insurance-related losses resulting from any "act of terrorism", which is certified by the secretary of the treasury, in consultation with the secretary of homeland security and the attorney general, for losses that exceed a threshold of industry losses of $160 in 2018, with the threshold increasing to $200 by 2020. under the program, in any one calendar year, the federal government would pay a percentage of losses incurred from a certified act of terrorism after an insurer's losses exceed 20% of the company's eligible direct commercial earned premiums of the prior calendar year up to a combined annual aggregate limit for the federal government and all insurers of $100 billion. the percentage of losses paid by the federal government is 82% in 2018, decreasing by 1 point annually to 80% in the year 2020. the company's estimated deductible under the program is $1.3 billion for 2018. if an act of terrorism or acts of terrorism result in covered losses exceeding the $100 billion annual industry aggregate limit, congress would be responsible for determining how additional losses in excess of $100 billion will be paid.
reinsurance for asbestos and environmental reserve development- under an adc reinsurance agreement, nico, a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway inc. ("berkshire"), assumes adverse net loss and allocated loss adjustment expense reserve development up to $1.5 billion above the company's net asbestos and environmental reserves recorded as of december 31, 2016. under retroactive reinsurance accounting, net adverse asbestos and environmental reserve development after december 31, 2016 results in an offsetting reinsurance recoverable up to the $1.5 billion limit. cumulative ceded losses up to the $650 reinsurance premium paid for the adc are recognized as a dollar-for-dollar offset to direct losses incurred. as of december 31, 2017, $285 of incurred asbestos and environmental losses had been ceded to nico. cumulative ceded losses exceeding the $650 reinsurance premium paid would result in a deferred gain. the deferred gain would be recognized over the claim settlement period in the proportion of the amount of cumulative ceded losses collected from the reinsurer to the estimated ultimate reinsurance recoveries. consequently, until periods when the deferred gain is recognized as a benefit to earnings, cumulative adverse development of asbestos and environmental claims after december 31, 2016 in excess of $650 may result in significant charges against earnings. furthermore, there is a risk that cumulative adverse development of asbestos and environmental claims could ultimately exceed the $1.5 billion treaty limit in which case all adverse development in excess of the treaty limit would be absorbed as a charge to earnings by the company. in these scenarios, the effect of these changes could be material to the company's consolidated operating results and liquidity.

to manage reinsurer credit risk, a reinsurance security review committee evaluates the credit standing, financial performance, management and operational quality of each potential reinsurer. in placing reinsurance, the company considers the nature of the risk reinsured, including the expected liability payout duration, and establishes limits tiered by reinsurer credit rating.
where its contracts permit, the company secures future claim obligations with various forms of collateral, including irrevocable letters of credit, secured trusts, funds held accounts and group wide offsets. as part of its reinsurance recoverable review, the company analyzes recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants, recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers and the overall credit quality of the company's reinsurers. as indicated in the above table, 77.1% of the gross reinsurance recoverables due from reinsurers rated by a.m. best were rated a- (excellent) or better as of december 31, 2017.
annually, the company completes evaluations of the reinsurance recoverable asset associated with older, long-term casualty liabilities reported in the property & casualty other operations reporting segment, and the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance reported in the commercial lines reporting segment. for a discussion regarding the results of these evaluations, see md&a - critical accounting estimates, property and casualty insurance product reserves, net of reinsurance.

guaranty funds and other insurance-related assessments as part of its risk management strategy, the company regularly monitors the financial strength of other insurers and, in particular, activity by insurance regulators and various state guaranty associations relating to troubled insurers. in all states, insurers licensed to transact certain classes of insurance are required to become members of a guaranty fund.
operational risk operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, human error, or from external events.
sources of operational risk operational risk is inherent in the company's business and functional areas. operational risks include legal; cyber and information security; models; third party vendors; technology; operations; business continuity; disaster recovery; internal and external fraud; and compliance.
impact operational risk can result in financial loss, disruption of our business, regulatory actions or damage to our reputation.
management responsibility for day-to-day management of operational risk lies within each business unit and functional area. erm provides an enterprise-wide view of the company's operational risk on an aggregate basis. erm is responsible for establishing, maintaining and communicating the framework, principles and guidelines of the company's operational risk management program. operational risk mitigation strategies include the following:
•   establishing policies and monitoring risk tolerances and exceptions;
•   conducting business risk assessments and implementing action plans where necessary;
•   validating existing crisis management protocols;
•   identifying and monitoring emerging risks; and
•   purchasing insurance coverage.
cybersecurity risk the hartford has implemented an information protection program with established governance routines that promote an adaptive approach for assessing and managing risks. the hartford has invested to build a 'defense-in-depth' strategy that uses multiple security measures to protect the integrity of the company's information assets. this 'defense-in-depth' strategy aligns to the national institute of standards and technology (nist) cyber security framework and provides preventative, detective and responsive measures that collectively protects the company. various cyber assurance methods, including security metrics, third party security assessments, external penetration testing, red team exercises, and cyber war game exercises are used to test the effectiveness of the overall cybersecurity control environment.
the hartford, like many other large financial services companies, blocks attempted cyber intrusions on a daily basis. in the event of a cyber intrusion, the company invokes its cyber incident response program commensurate with the nature of the intrusion. while the actual methods employed differ based on the event, our approach employs internal teams and outside advisors with specialized skills to support the response and recovery efforts and requires elevation of issues, as necessary, to senior management.
from a governance perspective, senior members of our enterprise risk management, information protection and internal audit functions provide detailed, regular reports on cybersecurity matters to the board, including the finance, investment, and risk management committee (firmco), which has principal responsibility for oversight of cybersecurity risk, and/or the audit committee, which oversees controls for the company's major risk exposures. the topics covered by these updates include the company's activities, policies and procedures to prevent, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents, as well as lessons learned from cybersecurity incidents and internal and external testing of our protection measures. firmco meets at each regular board meeting and is briefed on cyber risks at least annually.
financial risk financial risks include direct and indirect risks to the company's financial objectives coming from events that impact market conditions or prices. some events may cause correlated movement in multiple risk factors. the primary sources of financial risks are the company's invested assets. consistent with its risk appetite, the company establishes financial risk limits to control potential loss on a u.s. gaap, statutory, and economic basis. exposures are actively monitored, and mitigated where appropriate. the company uses various risk management strategies, including reinsurance and over-the-counter ("otc") and exchange traded derivatives with counterparties meeting the appropriate regulatory and due diligence requirements. derivatives are utilized to achieve one of four company-approved objectives: hedging risk arising from interest rate, equity market, commodity market, credit spread and issuer default, price or currency exchange rate risk or volatility; managing liquidity; controlling transaction costs; or entering into synthetic replication transactions. derivative activities are monitored and evaluated by the company's compliance and risk management teams and reviewed by senior management.

part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company identifies different categories of financial risk, including liquidity, credit, interest rate, equity and foreign currency exchange, as described below.
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk to current or prospective earnings or capital arising from the company's inability or perceived inability to meet its contractual funding obligations as they come due.
sources of liquidity risk sources of liquidity risk include funding risk, company-specific liquidity risk and market liquidity risk resulting from differences in the amount and timing of sources and uses of cash as well as company-specific and general market conditions. stressed market conditions may impact the ability to sell assets or otherwise transact business and may result in a significant loss in value.
impact inadequate capital resources and liquidity could negatively affect the company's overall financial strength and its ability to generate cash flows from its businesses, borrow funds at competitive rates, and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs.
management the company has defined ongoing monitoring and reporting requirements to assess liquidity across the enterprise under both current and stressed market conditions. the company measures and manages liquidity risk exposures and funding needs within prescribed limits across legal entities, taking into account legal, regulatory and operational limitations to the transferability of liquidity. the company also monitors internal and external conditions, and identifies material risk changes and emerging risks that may impact liquidity. the company's cfo has primary responsibility for liquidity risk.
for further discussion on liquidity see the section on capital resources and liquidity.
credit risk credit risk is the risk to earnings or capital due to uncertainty of an obligor's or counterparty's ability or willingness to meet its obligations in accordance with contractually agreed upon terms. credit risk is comprised of three major factors: the risk of change in credit quality, or credit migration risk; the risk of default; and the risk of a change in value due to changes in credit spreads.
sources of credit risk the majority of the company's credit risk is concentrated in its investment holdings, but it is also present in the company's reinsurance and insurance portfolios.
impact a decline in creditworthiness is typically associated with an increase in an investment's credit spread, and potentially result in an increase in other-than-temporary impairments and an increased probability of a realized loss upon sale. premiums receivable and reinsurance recoverables are also subject to credit risk based on the counterparty's unwillingness or inability to pay.
management the objective of the company's enterprise credit risk management strategy is to identify, quantify, and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis and to limit potential losses in accordance with an established credit risk management policy. the company primarily manages its credit risk by holding a diversified mix of investment grade issuers and counterparties across its investment, reinsurance, and insurance portfolios. potential losses are also limited within portfolios by diversifying across geographic regions, asset types, and sectors.
the company manages credit risk on an on-going basis through the use of various processes and analyses. both the investment and reinsurance areas have formulated procedures for counterparty approvals and authorizations, which establish minimum levels of creditworthiness and financial stability. credits considered for investment are subjected to underwriting reviews. within the investment portfolio, private securities are subject to committee review for approval. mitigation strategies vary across the three sources of credit risk, but may include:
•   investing in a portfolio of high-quality and diverse securities;
•   selling investments subject to credit risk;
•   hedging through use of credit default swaps;
•   clearing transactions through central clearing houses that require daily variation margin;
•   entering into contracts only with strong creditworthy institutions
•   requiring collateral; and
•   non-renewing policies/contracts or reinsurance treaties.
the company has developed credit exposure thresholds which are based upon counterparty ratings. aggregate counterparty credit quality and exposure are monitored on a daily basis utilizing an enterprise-wide credit exposure information system that contains data on issuers, ratings, exposures, and credit limits. exposures are tracked on a current and potential basis and aggregated by ultimate parent of the counterparty across investments, reinsurance receivables, insurance products with credit risk, and derivatives.
as of december 31, 2017, the company had no investment exposure to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer or counterparty greater than 10% of the company's stockholders' equity, other than the u.s. government and certain u.s. government securities. for further discussion of concentration of credit risk in the investment portfolio, see the concentration of credit risk section in note 6 - investments of notes to consolidated financial statements.
86
assets and liabilities subject to credit riskinvestments essentially all of the company's invested assets are subject to credit risk. credit related impairments on investments were $2 and $21, in 2017 and 2016, respectively. (see the enterprise risk management section of the md&a under "other-than-temporary impairments.")
reinsurance recoverables reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, were $4,061 and $3,659, as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. (see the enterprise risk management section of the md&a under "reinsurance as a risk management strategy.")
premiums receivable and agents' balances premiums receivable and agents' balances, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, were $3,910 and $3,730, as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. (for a discussion regarding collectibility of these balances, see note 1, basis of presentation and significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements under the section labeled "revenue recognition.")
credit risk of derivatives the company uses various derivative counterparties in executing its derivative transactions. the use of counterparties creates credit risk that the counterparty may not perform in accordance with the terms of the derivative transaction.
downgrades to the credit ratings of the company's insurance operating companies may have adverse implications for its use of derivatives. in some cases, downgrades may give derivative counterparties for over-the-counter derivatives and clearing brokers for otc-cleared derivatives the right to cancel and settle outstanding derivative trades or require additional collateral to be posted. in addition, downgrades may result in counterparties and clearing brokers becoming unwilling to engage in or clear additional derivatives or may require collateralization before entering into any new trades.
managing the credit risk of counterparties to derivative instruments the company has derivative counterparty exposure policies which limit the company's exposure to credit risk. the company monitors counterparty exposure on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with company policies and statutory limitations. the company's policies with respect to derivative counterparty exposure establishes market-based credit limits, favors long-term financial stability and creditworthiness of the counterparty and typically requires credit enhancement/credit risk reducing agreements, which are monitored and evaluated by the company's risk management team and reviewed by senior management.
the company minimizes the credit risk of derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties primarily rated a or better. the company also generally requires that otc derivative contracts be governed by an international swaps and derivatives association ("isda") master agreement, which is structured by legal entity and by counterparty and permits right of offset. the company enters into credit support annexes in conjunction with the isda agreements, which require daily collateral settlement based upon agreed upon thresholds.
the company has developed credit exposure thresholds which are based upon counterparty ratings. credit exposures are measured using the market value of the derivatives, resulting in amounts owed to the company by its counterparties or potential payment obligations from the company to its counterparties. the notional amounts of derivative contracts represent the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and are not reflective of credit risk. for purposes of daily derivative collateral maintenance, credit exposures are generally quantified based on the prior business day's market value and collateral is pledged to and held by, or on behalf of, the company to the extent the current value of the derivatives exceed the contractual thresholds. in accordance with industry standards and the contractual agreements, collateral is typically settled on the same business day. the company has exposure to credit risk for amounts below the exposure thresholds which are uncollateralized, as well as for market fluctuations that may occur between contractual settlement periods of collateral movements.
for the company's derivative programs, the maximum uncollateralized threshold for a derivative counterparty for a single legal entity is $10. the company currently transacts otc derivatives in three legal entities that have a threshold greater than zero. the maximum combined threshold for a single counterparty across all legal entities that use derivatives and have a threshold greater than zero is $10. in addition, the company may have exposure to multiple counterparties in a single corporate family due to a common credit support provider. as of december 31, 2017, the maximum combined threshold for all counterparties under a single credit support provider across all legal entities that use derivatives and have a threshold greater than zero was $10. based on the contractual terms of the collateral agreements, these thresholds may be immediately reduced due to a downgrade in either party's credit rating. for further discussion, see the derivative commitments section of note 14 commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, the company incurred no losses on derivative instruments due to counterparty default.
use of credit derivatives the company may also use credit default swaps to manage credit exposure or to assume credit risk to enhance yield.
credit risk reduced through credit derivatives the company uses credit derivatives to purchase credit protection with respect to a single entity or referenced index. the company purchases credit protection through credit default swaps to economically hedge and manage credit risk of certain fixed maturity investments across multiple sectors of the investment portfolio. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, the notional amount related to credit derivatives that purchase credit protection was $61 and $78, respectively, while the fair value was $1 and $(1), respectively. these amounts do not include positions that are in offsetting relationships.
credit risk assumed through credit derivatives the company also enters into credit default swaps that assume credit risk as part of replication transactions. replication

interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk of financial loss due to adverse changes in the value of assets and liabilities arising from movements in interest rates. interest rate risk encompasses exposures with respect to changes in the level of interest rates, the shape of the term structure of rates and the volatility of interest rates. interest rate risk does not include exposure to changes in credit spreads.
sources of interest rate risk the company has exposure to interest rates arising from its fixed maturity securities and discount rate assumptions associated with the company's pension and other post retirement benefit obligations. in addition, certain product liabilities expose the company to interest rate risk, in particular short and long-term disability claim reserves.
impact changes in interest rates from current levels can have both favorable and unfavorable effects for the company.

the company may also utilize a variety of derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate risk associated with its investment portfolio or to hedge liabilities. interest rate caps, floors, swaps, swaptions, and futures may be used to manage portfolio duration. interest rate swaps are primarily used to convert interest receipts or payments to a fixed or variable rate. the use of such swaps enables the company to customize contract terms and conditions to desired objectives and manage the duration profile within established tolerances. interest rate swaps are also used to hedge the variability in the cash flows of a forecasted purchase or sale of fixed rate securities due to changes in interest rates. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, notional amounts pertaining to derivatives utilized to manage interest rate risk, including offsetting positions, totaled $10.2 billion and $10.6 billion, respectively related to investments. the fair value of these derivatives was $(83) and $(565) as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
assets and liabilities subject to interest rate risk fixed income investments the fair value of fixed income investments, which include fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans, and short-term investments, was $42.5 billion and $37.2 billion at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the weighted average duration of the portfolio, including derivative instruments, was approximately 5.2 years and 5.0 years as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.group life and disability product liabilities the cash outflows associated with contracts issued by the company's group benefits segment, primarily group life and short and long-term disability policy liabilities, are not interest rate sensitive but vary based on timing. though the aggregate cash flow payment streams are relatively predictable, these products may rely upon actuarial pricing assumptions (including mortality and morbidity) and have an element of cash flow uncertainty. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, the company had $8,512 and $5,772, respectively of reserves for group life and disability contracts with the increase since december 31, 2016 largely due to the acquisition of aetna's u.s. group life and disability business.

part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations the company's pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations are exposed to interest rate risk based upon the sensitivity of present value obligations to changes in liability discount rates. the discount rate assumption is based upon an interest rate yield curve that reflects high-quality fixed income investments consistent with the maturity profile of the expected liability cash flows. the company is exposed to the risk of having to make additional plan contributions if the plans' investment returns are lower than expected. (for further discussion of discounting pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, refer to note 18 - employee benefit plans of notes to consolidated financial statements.) as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, the company had $926 and $1,106, respectively, of unfunded liabilities for pension and post-retirement benefit obligations recorded within other liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets.
interest rate sensitivity invested assets supporting group life and disability reserves included in the following table is the before-tax change in the net economic value of contracts issued by the company's group benefits segment, primarily group life and disability, for which fixed valuation discount rate assumptions are established based upon investment returns assumed in pricing, along with the corresponding invested assets. also included in this analysis are the interest rate sensitive derivatives used by the company to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk in the investment portfolios supporting these contracts. this analysis does not include the assets and corresponding liabilities of other insurance products such as automobile, property, workers' compensation and general liability insurance. certain financial instruments, such as limited partnerships and other alternative investments, have been omitted from the analysis as the interest rate sensitivity of these investments is generally lower and less predictable than fixed income investments. the calculation of the estimated hypothetical change in net economic value below assumes a 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shift in the yield curve.

the carrying value of assets supporting the liabilities related to the businesses included in the table above was $10.1 billion and $6.6 billion, as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and included fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans and short-term investments. the assets supporting the liabilities are monitored and managed within set duration guidelines and are evaluated on a daily basis, as well as annually, using scenario simulation techniques in compliance with regulatory requirements.
invested assets not supporting group life and disability reserves the following table provides an analysis showing the estimated before-tax change in the fair value of the company's investments and related derivatives, excluding assets supporting group life and disability reserves which are included in the table above, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve as of december 31, 2017 and 2016. certain financial instruments, such as limited partnerships and other alternative investments, have been omitted from the analysis as the interest rate sensitivity of these investments is generally lower and less predictable than fixed income investments.

the carrying value of fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans and short-term investments related to the businesses included in the table above was $32.4 billion and $30.6 billion, as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the selection of the 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve was made only as an illustration of the potential hypothetical impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the above analysis. the company's sensitivity analysis calculation assumes that the composition of invested assets and liabilities remain materially consistent throughout the year and that the current relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates will remain constant over time. as a result, these calculations may not fully capture the impact of portfolio re-allocations, significant product sales or non-parallel changes in interest rates.
equity risk equity risk is the risk of financial loss due to changes in the value of global equities or equity indices.
sources of equity risk the company has exposure to equity risk from invested assets, mutual fund assets under management, and assets that support the company's pension and other post retirement benefit plans.
impact declines in equity markets may result in losses due to sales or impairments that are recognized as realized losses in earnings or in reductions in market value that are recognized as unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income ("aoci"). beginning in 2018, changes in the market value of equity securities will be recorded within our reported earnings. declines in equity markets may also decrease the value of limited partnerships and other alternative investments or result in losses
89
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on derivatives, including on embedded product derivatives, thereby negatively impacting our reported earnings.
the company's mutual funds are significantly influenced by the u.s. and other equity markets. generally, declines in equity markets will reduce the value of assets under management and the amount of fee income generated from those assets.
increases in equity markets will generally have the inverse impact.
management the company uses various approaches in managing its equity exposure, including limits on the proportion of assets invested in equities, diversification of the equity portfolio, and hedging of changes in equity indexes.
assets and liabilities subject to equity risk the investment portfolio is exposed to losses from market declines affecting equity securities, alternative assets, and limited partnerships.assets under management in mutual funds may experience lower earnings during equity market declines because fee income is earned based upon the value of assets under management.
assets supporting pension and other post-retirement benefit plans the company may be required to make additional plan contributions if equity investments in the plan portfolios decline in value. the asset allocation mix is reviewed on a periodic basis. in order to minimize the risk, the pension plans maintain a listing of permissible and prohibited investments and impose concentration limits and investment quality requirements on permissible investment options. for further discussion of equity risk associated with the pension plans, see note 18 employee benefit plans of notes to consolidated financial statements.
foreign currency exchange risk foreign currency exchange risk is the risk of financial loss due to changes in the relative value between currencies.
sources of currency risk the company has foreign currency exchange risk in non-u.s. dollar denominated investments, which primarily consist of fixed maturity and equity investments and foreign denominated cash.
impact changes in relative values between currencies can create variability in cash flows and realized or unrealized gains and losses on changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities.
based on the fair values of the company's non-u.s. dollar denominated securities and derivative instruments as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, management estimates that a hypothetical 10% unfavorable change in exchange rates would decrease the fair values by a before-tax total of $10 and $11, respectively, and as of december 31, 2016 excludes the impact of the assets that transferred to held for sale related to the u.k. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries . actual results could differ materially due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the analysis.
management the open foreign currency exposure of non-u.s. dollar denominated investments will most commonly be reduced through the sale of the assets or through hedges using currency futures/forwards/swaps. in order to manage the currency risk related to any non-u.s. dollar denominated liability contracts, the company enters into foreign currency swaps or holds non-u.s. dollar denominated investments.
assets and liabilities subject to foreign currency exchange risk non-u.s. dollar denominated fixed maturities, equities, and cash the fair values of the non-u.s. dollar denominated fixed maturities , equities and cash, excluding assets held for sale, at december 31, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $298 and $213, respectively. included in these amounts are $128 and $116 at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to non-u.s. dollar denominated fixed maturities, equities and cash that directly support liabilities denominated in the same currencies. the currency risk of the remaining non-u.s. dollar denominated fixed maturities and equities are hedged with foreign currency swaps. in addition, the company holds $55 of euro-denominated cash which is hedged with foreign currency forwards.
investment in a p&c run-off entity in the united kingdom during 2015, the company entered into certain foreign currency forwards to hedge the currency impacts on changes in equity of a p&c run-off entity in the united kingdom that was sold during 2017. at december 31, 2016, the derivatives used to hedge the currency impacts had a total notional amount of $200, and a total fair value of $(2), respectively. the company no longer held these hedges as of december 31, 2017.
financial risk on statutory capital statutory surplus amounts and risk-based capital ("rbc") ratios may increase or decrease in any period depending upon a variety of factors and may be compounded in extreme scenarios or if multiple factors occur at the same time. in general, as equity market levels and interest rates decline, the amount and volatility of both our actual or potential obligation, as well as the related statutory surplus and capital margin can be materially negatively affected, sometimes at a greater than linear rate. at times the impact of changes in certain market factors or a combination of multiple factors on rbc ratios can be counterintuitive. factors include:
•   a decrease in the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio, due in part to credit spreads widening, may result in a decrease in statutory surplus and rbc ratios.
90
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
•   decreases in the value of certain derivative instruments that do not get hedge accounting, may reduce statutory surplus and rbc ratios.
•   non-market factors, which can also impact the amount and volatility of both our actual potential obligation, as well as the related statutory surplus and capital margin.
most of these factors are outside of the company's control. the company's financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by the statutory surplus amounts and rbc ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries. in addition, rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital we must hold in order to maintain our current ratings.

[1]   pre-refunded bonds are bonds for which an irrevocable trust containing sufficient u.s. treasury, agency, or other securities has been established to fund the remaining payments of principal and interest.
[2]   leasing revenue bonds are generally the obligations of a financing authority established by the municipality that leases facilities back to a municipality. the notes are typically secured by lease payments made by the municipality that is leasing the facilities financed by the issue. lease payments may be subject to annual appropriation by the municipality or the municipality may be obligated to appropriate general tax revenues to make lease payments.
as of december 31, 2017, the largest issuer concentrations were the new york dormitory authority, the new york city transitional finance authority, and the commonwealth of massachusetts, which each comprised less than 3% of the municipal bond portfolio and were primarily comprised of general obligation and revenue bonds. as of december 31, 2016, the largest issuer concentrations were the commonwealth of massachusetts, the new york dormitory authority, the state of california, which each comprised less than 3% of the municipal bond portfolio and were primarily comprised of general obligation and revenue bonds. in total, municipal bonds make up 28% of the fair value of the company's investment portfolio . the company has evaluated its portfolio allocation to municipal bonds with respect to the changes in corporate income tax rates beginning in 2018, and does not expect to make significant allocation changes at this time. tax-exempt municipal debt remains a high quality asset class with very low expected defaults and is a source of portfolio diversification. the company will continue to actively assess the impacts of the income tax rate changes on the municipal market and may make portfolio changes over time based upon our view of the value of the sector. if we feel that value deteriorates relative to other high quality sectors, we may allow the portfolio to reduce over time as principal is repaid.
limited partnerships and other alternative investments the following table presents the company's investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments which include hedge funds, real estate funds, and private equity funds. real estate funds consist of investments primarily in real estate joint ventures and equity funds, including some funds with public market exposure. private equity funds primarily consist of investments in funds whose assets typically consist of a diversified pool of investments in small to mid-sized non-public businesses with high growth potential as well as limited exposure to public markets.

available-for-sale securities - unrealized loss aging the total gross unrealized losses were $130 as of december 31, 2017, and have improved $189, or 59%, from december 31, 2016, due to tighter credit spreads. as of december 31, 2017, (117) of the gross unrealized losses were associated with securities depressed less than 20% of cost or amortized cost. the remaining (13) of gross unrealized losses were associated with securities depressed greater than 20%. the securities depressed more than 20% are primarily equity securities depressed due to issuer specific deterioration, as well as securities with exposure to commercial real estate which are depressed primarily due to higher rates since the securities were purchased.
as part of the company's ongoing security monitoring process, the company has reviewed its afs securities in an unrealized loss position and concluded that these securities are temporarily depressed and are expected to recover in value as the securities approach maturity or as market spreads tighten. for these securities in an unrealized loss position where a credit impairment has not been recorded, the company's best estimate of expected future cash flows are sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of the security. furthermore, the company neither has an intention to sell nor does it expect to be required to sell these securities. for further information regarding the company's impairment analysis, see other-than-temporary impairments in the investment portfolio risks and risk management section of this md&a.

liquidity requirements and sources of capital the hartford financial services group, inc. (holding company)
the liquidity requirements of the holding company of the hartford financial services group, inc. ("hfsg holding company") have been and will continue to be met by hfsg holding company's fixed maturities, short-term investments and cash, and dividends from its subsidiaries, principally its insurance operations, as well as the issuance of common stock, debt or other capital securities and borrowings from its credit facilities, as needed.
as of december 31, 2017, hfsg holding company held fixed maturities, short-term investments and cash of $1.1 billion. expected liquidity requirements of the hfsg holding company for the next twelve months include payments of 6.3% notes, due 2018 of $320 at maturity, $500 junior subordinated notes expected to be called in june 2018, interest payments on debt of approximately $295 and common stockholder dividends, subject to discretion of the board of directors, of approximately $362.
the hartford has an intercompany liquidity agreement that allows for short-term advances of funds among the hfsg holding company and certain affiliates of up to $2.0 billion for liquidity and other general corporate purposes. the connecticut insurance department ("ctdoi") granted approval for certain affiliated insurance companies that are parties to the agreement to treat receivables from a parent, including the hfsg holding company, as admitted assets for statutory accounting purposes. as of december 31, 2017, there were no amounts outstanding from the hfsg holding company.
debt on march 15, 2017, the company repaid its $416, 5.375% senior notes at maturity.

pension plans and other postretirement benefits while the company has significant discretion in making voluntary contributions to the u. s. qualified defined benefit pension plan, minimum contributions are mandated in certain circumstances pursuant to the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended by the pension protection act of 2006, the worker, retiree, and employer recovery act of 2008, the preservation of access to care for medicare beneficiaries and pension relief act of 2010, the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act of 2012 (map-21) and internal revenue code regulations. the company made contributions to the u. s. qualified defined benefit pension plan of approximately $280, $300 and $100 in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. no contributions were made to the other postretirement plans in 2017, 2016 and 2015. the company's 2017, 2016 and 2015 required minimum funding contributions were immaterial. the company does not have a 2018 required minimum funding contribution for the u.s. qualified defined benefit pension plan and the funding requirements for all pension plans are expected to be immaterial. the company has not determined whether, and to what extent, contributions may be made to the u. s. qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2018. the company will monitor the funded status of the u.s. qualified defined benefit pension plan during 2018 to make this determination.
beginning in 2017, the company began to use a full yield-curve approach in the estimation of the interest cost component of net periodic benefit costs for its qualified and non-qualified pension plans and the postretirement benefit plan. the full yield curve approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve that are used in its determination of the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the year. the change was made to provide a better estimate of the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost by better aligning projected benefit cash flows with corresponding spot rates on the yield curve rather than using a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve as had been done historically.
this change did not affect the measurement of the company's total benefit obligations as the change in the interest cost in net income is completely offset in the actuarial (gain) loss reported for the period in other comprehensive income. the change resulted in a reduction of the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost for 2017 of $32 before tax. the discount rate used to measure interest cost during 2017 was 3.58% for the period from january 1, 2017 to june 30, 2017 and 3.37% for the period from july 1, 2017 to december 31, 2017 for the qualified pension plan, 3.55% for the non-qualified pension plan, and 3.13% for the postretirement benefit plan. under the company's historical estimation approach, the weighted average discount rate for the interest cost component would have been 4.22% for the period from january 1, 2017 to june 30, 2017 and 3.92% for the period from july 1, 2017 to december 31, 2017 for the qualified pension plan, 4.19% for the non-qualified pension plan and 3.97% for the postretirement benefit plan. the company accounted for this change as a change in estimate, and accordingly, recognized the effect prospectively beginning in 2017.
on june 30, 2017, the company purchased a group annuity contract to transfer approximately $1.6 billion of the company's outstanding pension benefit obligations related to certain u.s. retirees, terminated vested participants, and beneficiaries. as a result of this transaction, in the second quarter of 2017, the company recognized a pre-tax settlement charge of $750 ($488 after-tax) and a reduction to shareholders' equity of $144.
in connection with this transaction, the company made a contribution of $280 in september 2017 to the u.s. qualified pension plan in order to maintain the plan's pre-transaction funded status.
dividends from insurance subsidiaries dividends to the hfsg holding company from its insurance subsidiaries are restricted by insurance regulation. the payment of dividends by connecticut-domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance holding company laws of connecticut. these laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend, which, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (i) 10% of the insurer's policyholder surplus as of december 31 of the preceding year or (ii) net income (or net gain from operations, if such company is a life insurance company) for the twelve-month period ending on the thirty-first day of december last preceding, in each case determined under statutory insurance accounting principles. the insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which the hartford's insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed commercially domiciled under applicable state insurance laws contain similar or in certain state(s) more restrictive limitations on the payment of dividends. in addition, if any dividend of a domiciled insurer exceeds the insurer's earned surplus or certain other thresholds as calculated under applicable state insurance law, the dividend requires the prior approval of the domestic regulator. dividends paid to hfsg holding company by its life insurance subsidiaries are further dependent on cash requirements of hartford life, inc. ("hli"), the holding company of its life and annuity run-off business held for sale, and hartford life and accident insurance company ("hla") and other factors. dividends paid to hfsg from hli are subject to provisions of the stock and asset purchase agreement related to the sale of hli and its run-off life and annuity insurance business and provides for expected dividends from hli of $300 prior to closing of the sale, subject to regulatory approval. in addition to statutory limitations on paying dividends, the company also takes other items into consideration when determining dividends from subsidiaries. these considerations include, but are not limited to, expected earnings and capitalization of the subsidiary, regulatory

part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital requirements and liquidity requirements of the individual operating company.
total dividends received by hfsg in 2017 from its p&c insurance subsidiaries were $2.4 billion. in connection with the purchase of aetna's u.s. group life and disability business in the fourth quarter of 2017, the p&c insurance subsidiaries received approval and paid an extraordinary dividend to the hfsg holding company of $1.4 billion, of which $800 was funded by approved extraordinary dividends from hlic. the $800 of extraordinary dividends from hlic was used to pay down principal on the intercompany note owed by hartford holdings, inc. (hhi) to hartford fire insurance company. in addition, $100 of hartford fire insurance company dividends were subsequently contributed to a run-off p&c subsidiary and $63 of p&c insurance subsidiary dividends relate to principal and interest payments on an intercompany note owed by hhi to hartford fire insurance company. accordingly, the net dividend to hfsg holding company for the 2017 full year from p&c insurance subsidiaries was approximately $1.5 billion.
the $800 of extraordinary dividends from hlic were funded in part by $550 of extraordinary dividends from hlic's indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, hartford life and annuity insurance company ("hlai").
total net dividends received by hfsg from subsidiaries in 2017 were $3.1 billion, including the $1.5 billion of net dividends from p&c subsidiaries, $1.4 billion from hlic, $188 from hla and $75 from mutual funds.
2018 dividend capacity
•   p&amp;c - the company's property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are permitted to pay up to a maximum of approximately $1.4 billion in dividends to hfsg holding company without prior approval from the applicable insurance commissioner. in 2018, hfsg holding company anticipates receiving net dividends of approximately $350 from its property and casualty insurance subsidiaries.
•   group benefits - hartford life and accident insurance company ("hla") has no dividend capacity for 2018 and does not anticipate paying dividends to the hsfg holding company.
•   life and annuity run-off business - on december 4, 2017, the hartford announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its life and annuity run-off businesses to a group of investors led by cornell capital llc, atlas merchant capital llc, trb advisors lp, global atlantic financial group, pine brook and j. safra group. up until the anticipated close of the sale, hlic does not have any additional dividend capacity. prior to the expected close in 2018, hsfg holding company anticipates receiving $300 of dividends from hlic through hli, subject to approval by the connecticut insurance commissioner. other intercompany transactions with hli will be net settled prior to closing.
other sources of capital for the hfsg holding company the hartford endeavors to maintain a capital structure that provides financial and operational flexibility to its insurance subsidiaries, ratings that support its competitive position in the financial services marketplace (see the "ratings" section below for further discussion), and shareholder returns. as a result, the company may from time to time raise capital from the issuance of equity, equity-related debt or other capital securities and is continuously evaluating strategic opportunities. the issuance of debt, common equity, equity-related debt or other capital securities could result in the dilution of shareholder interests or reduced net income due to additional interest expense.
shelf registrations the hartford filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission (the "sec") on july 29, 2016 that permits it to offer and sell debt and equity securities during the three-year life of the registration statement.
contingent capital facility the hartford was party to a put option agreement that provided the hartford with the right to require the glen meadow abc trust, a delaware statutory trust, at any time and from time to time, to purchase the hartford's junior subordinated notes in a maximum aggregate principal amount not to exceed $500. on february 8, 2017, the hartford exercised the put option resulting in the issuance of $500 in junior subordinated notes with proceeds received on february 15, 2017. under the put option agreement, the hartford had been paying the glen meadow abc trust premiums on a periodic basis, calculated with respect to the aggregate principal amount of notes that the hartford had the right to put to the glen meadow abc trust for such period. the hartford agreed to reimburse the glen meadow abc trust for certain fees and ordinary expenses. up until the company exercised the put option, the company held a variable interest in the glen meadow abc trust where the company was not the primary beneficiary. as a result, the company did not consolidate the glen meadow abc trust.
the junior subordinated notes have a scheduled maturity of february 12, 2047, and a final maturity of february 12, 2067. the company is required to use reasonable efforts to sell certain qualifying replacement securities in order to repay the debentures at the scheduled maturity date. the junior subordinated notes bear interest at an annual rate of three-month libor plus 2.125%, payable quarterly, and are unsecured, subordinated indebtedness of the hartford. the hartford will have the right, on one or more occasions, to defer interest payments due on the junior subordinated notes under specified circumstances.
upon receipt of the proceeds, the company entered into a replacement capital covenant (the "rcc"). under the terms of the rcc, if the company redeems the debentures at any time prior to february 12, 2047 (or such earlier date on which the rcc terminates by its terms) it can only do so with the proceeds from the sale of certain qualifying replacement securities. the rcc also prohibits the company from redeeming all or any portion of the notes on or prior to february 15, 2022.
commercial paper and revolving credit facility commercial paper the hartford's maximum borrowings available under its commercial paper program are $1 billion. the company is dependent upon market conditions to access short-term financing through the issuance of commercial paper to investors. as of december 31, 2017 there was no commercial paper outstanding.
100
part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations revolving credit facilities the company has a senior unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the "credit facility") that provides for borrowing capacity up to $1 billion of unsecured credit through october 31, 2019 available in u.s. dollars, euro, sterling, canadian dollars and japanese yen. as of december 31, 2017, no borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility. as of december 31, 2017, the company was in compliance with all financial covenants within the credit facility.
derivative commitments certain of the company's derivative agreements contain provisions that are tied to the financial strength ratings, as set by nationally recognized statistical agencies, of the individual legal entity that entered into the derivative agreement. if the legal entity's financial strength were to fall below certain ratings, the counterparties to the derivative agreements could demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization and in certain instances enable the counterparties to terminate the agreements and demand immediate settlement of all outstanding derivative positions traded under each impacted bilateral agreement. the settlement amount is determined by netting the derivative positions transacted under each agreement. if the termination rights were to be exercised by the counterparties, it could impact the legal entity's ability to conduct hedging activities by increasing the associated costs and decreasing the willingness of counterparties to transact with the legal entity. the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position as of december 31, 2017 was $534. for this $534, the legal entities have posted collateral of $609, which is inclusive of initial margin requirements, in the normal course of business. based on derivative market values as of december 31, 2017, a downgrade of one level below the current financial strength ratings by either moody's or s&p would not require additional assets to be posted as collateral. based on derivative market values as of december 31, 2017, a downgrade of two levels below the current financial strength ratings by either moody's or s&p would require an additional $10 of assets to be posted as collateral. these collateral amounts could change as derivative market values change, as a result of changes in our hedging activities or to the extent changes in contractual terms are negotiated. the nature of the collateral that we would post, if required, would be primarily in the form of u.s. treasury bills, u.s. treasury notes and government agency securities.
as of december 31, 2017, the company did not participate in any derivative relationships that would be subject to an immediate termination in the event of a downgrade of one level below the current financial strength ratings. this could change as a result of changes in our hedging activities or to the extent changes in contractual terms are negotiated.
insurance operations while subject to variability period to period, claim frequency and severity patterns continue to be within historical norms and, therefore, the company's insurance operations' current liquidity position is considered to be sufficient to meet anticipated demands over the next twelve months. for a discussion and tabular presentation of the company's current contractual obligations by period, refer to off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations within the capital resources and liquidity section of the md&a.
the principal sources of operating funds are premiums, fees earned from assets under management and investment income, while investing cash flows originate from maturities and sales of invested assets. the primary uses of funds are to pay claims, claim adjustment expenses, commissions and other underwriting and insurance operating costs, taxes, to purchase new investments and to make dividend payments to the hfsg holding company.
the company's insurance operations consist of property and casualty insurance products (collectively referred to as "property & casualty operations") and group benefits.
property & casualty operations property & casualty operations holds fixed maturity securities including a significant short-term investment position (securities with maturities of one year or less at the time of purchase) to meet liquidity needs.
property & casualty as of december 31, 2017
fixed maturities                    $25,601
short-term investments                1,268
cash                                    156
less: derivative collateral              86
total                               $26,939
liquidity requirements that are unable to be funded by property & casualty operation's short-term investments would be satisfied with current operating funds, including premiums or proceeds received through the sale of invested assets. a sale of invested assets could result in significant realized capital losses.
group benefits operations group benefits operations' total unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves of $8.5 billion are supported by $12.1 billion of cash and invested assets, including assets available to meet liquidity needs as shown below.
group benefits operations as of december 31, 2017
fixed maturities                    $10,500
short-term investments                  398
cash                                     12
less: derivative collateral              25
total                               $10,885
capital resources available to pay group benefits loss and loss adjustment expense reserves will be funded by hartford life and accident insurance company.

[1]   the following points are significant to understanding the cash flows estimated for obligations (gross of reinsurance) under property and casualty contracts:
•   reserves for property &amp; casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses include ibnr and case reserves. while payments due on claim reserves are considered contractual obligations because they relate to insurance policies issued by the company, the ultimate amount to be paid to settle both case reserves and ibnr is an estimate, subject to significant uncertainty. the actual amount to be paid is not finally determined until the company reaches a settlement with the claimant. final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates, particularly since many claims will not be settled until well into the future.
•   in estimating the timing of future payments by year, the company has assumed that its historical payment patterns will continue. however, the actual timing of future payments could vary materially from these estimates due to, among other things, changes in claim reporting and payment patterns and large unanticipated settlements. in particular, there is significant uncertainty over the claim payment patterns of asbestos and environmental claims. in addition, the table does not include future cash flows related to the receipt of premiums that may be used, in part, to fund loss payments.
•   under u.s. gaap, the company is only permitted to discount reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses in cases where the payment pattern and ultimate loss costs are fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. for the company, these include claim settlements with permanently disabled claimants. as of december 31, 2017, the total property and casualty reserves in the above table are gross of a reserve discount of $410.
[2]   estimated group life and disability obligations are based on assumptions comparable with the company's historical experience, modified for recent observed trends. due to the significance of the assumptions used, the amounts presented could materially differ from actual results. as of december 31, 2017, the total group life and disability obligations in the above table are gross of a reserve discount of $1.5 billion.
[3]   includes future minimum lease payments on operating lease agreements. see note 14 - commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on lease commitments.
[4]   includes contractual principal and interest payments. see note 13 - debt of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of long-term debt obligations.
[5]   includes $989 million in commitments to purchase investments including approximately $829 of limited partnership and other alternative investments, $54 of private placements, and $106 of mortgage loans. outstanding commitments under these limited partnerships and mortgage loans are included in payments due in less than 1 year since the timing of funding these commitments cannot be reliably estimated. the remaining commitments to purchase investments primarily represent payables for securities purchased which are reflected on the company's consolidated balance sheets. also included in purchase obligations is $701 relating to contractual commitments to purchase various goods and services such as maintenance, human resources, and information technology in the normal course of business. purchase obligations exclude contracts that are cancelable without penalty or contracts that do not specify minimum levels of goods or services to be purchased.
[6]   includes cash collateral of $11 which the company has accepted in connection with the company's derivative instruments. since the timing of the return of the collateral is uncertain, the return of the collateral has been included in the payments due in less than 1 year. also included in other long-term liabilities are net unrecognized tax benefits of $9.

year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016
cash provided by operating activities increased in 2017 as compared to the prior year due, in part, to an increase in fee income received, a decrease in taxes paid and a decrease in property & casualty claim payments, largely offset by the $650 ceded premium paid to nico for the asbestos and environmental adverse development cover entered into in 2016.

ratings ratings are an important factor in establishing a competitive position in the insurance marketplace and impact the company's ability to access financing and its cost of borrowing. there can be no assurance that the company's ratings will continue for any given period of time, or that they will not be changed. in the event the company's ratings are downgraded, the company's competitive position, ability to access financing, and its cost of borrowing, may be adversely impacted.

a portion of dividends from p&c insurance subsidiaries in 2017 was used to help fund the purchase of aetna's u.s. group life and disability business. in connection with the acquisition, the company paid a ceding commission of $1.38 billion which drove the 2017 statutory net loss of the group benefits subsidiary, hla. to support the newly acquired business and fund the ceding commission, hla received capital contributions of $1,650 from its parent.
stat to gaap differences significant differences between u.s. gaap stockholders' equity and aggregate statutory capital prepared in accordance with u.s. stat include the following:
•   u.s. stat excludes equity of non-insurance and foreign insurance subsidiaries not held by u.s. insurance subsidiaries.
•   costs incurred by the company to acquire insurance policies are deferred under u.s. gaap while those costs are expensed immediately under u.s. stat.
•   temporary differences between the book and tax basis of an asset or liability which are recorded as deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability under u.s. gaap while those amounts deferred are subject to limitations under u.s. stat.
•   the assumptions used in the determination of life benefit reserves (i.e. for group benefits contracts) are prescribed under u.s. stat, while the assumptions used under u.s. gaap are generally the company's best estimates.
•   the difference between the amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturity and other investments, net of tax, is recorded as an increase or decrease to the carrying value of the related asset and to equity under u.s. gaap, while u.s. stat only records certain securities at fair value, such as equity securities and certain lower rated bonds required by the naic to be recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value.
•   u.s. stat for life insurance companies like hla establishes a formula reserve for realized and unrealized losses due to default and equity risks associated with certain invested assets (the asset valuation reserve), while u.s. gaap does not. also, for those realized gains and losses caused by changes in interest rates, u.s. stat for life insurance companies defers and amortizes the gains and losses, caused by changes in interest rates, into income over the original life to maturity of the asset sold (the interest maintenance reserve) while u.s. gaap does not.
•   goodwill arising from the acquisition of a business is tested for recoverability on an annual basis (or more frequently, as necessary) for u.s. gaap, while under u.s. stat goodwill is amortized over a period not to exceed 10 years and the amount of goodwill admitted as an asset is limited.
in addition, certain assets, including a portion of premiums receivable and fixed assets, are non-admitted (recorded at zero value and charged against surplus) under u.s. stat. u.s. gaap generally evaluates assets based on their recoverability.
risk-based capital the company's u.s. insurance companies' states of domicile impose rbc requirements. the requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations based on its size and risk profile. regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of a company's total adjusted capital ("tac") to its authorized control level rbc ("acl rbc"). companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. the minimum level of tac before corrective action commences ("company action level") is two times the acl rbc. the adequacy of a company's capital is determined by the ratio of a company's tac to its company action level, known as the "rbc ratio". all of the company's operating insurance subsidiaries had rbc ratios in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable insurance regulations. on an aggregate basis, the company's u.s. property and casualty insurance companies' rbc ratio was in excess of 200% of its company action level as of december 31, 2017 and 2016. the rbc ratios for the company's group benefits insurance operating subsidiary (hla) was in excess of 300% of its company action level as of december 31, 2017 and 2016. the rbc ratio of the company's held for sale life

part ii - item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations insurance and annuity run-off entities was in excess of 300% of its respective company action levels as of december 31, 2017 and 2016. the reporting of rbc ratios is not intended for the purpose of ranking any insurance company, or for use in connection with any marketing, advertising, or promotional activities.
similar to the rbc ratios that are employed by u.s. insurance regulators, regulatory authorities in the international jurisdictions in which the company operates generally establish minimum solvency requirements for insurance companies. all of the company's international insurance subsidiaries have solvency margins in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable regulatory authorities.
sensitivity in any particular year, statutory capital amounts and rbc ratios may increase or decrease depending upon a variety of factors. the amount of change in the statutory capital or rbc ratios can vary based on individual factors and may be compounded in extreme scenarios or if multiple factors occur at the same time. at times the impact of changes in certain market factors or a combination of multiple factors on rbc ratios can be counterintuitive. for further discussion on these factors and the potential impacts to the life insurance subsidiaries, see md&a - enterprise risk management, financial risk on statutory capital.
statutory capital at the property and casualty subsidiaries has historically been maintained at or above the capital level required to meet "aa level" ratings from rating agencies. statutory capital generated by the property and casualty subsidiaries in excess of the capital level required to meet "aa level" ratings is available for use by the enterprise or for corporate purposes. the amount of statutory capital can increase or decrease depending on a number of factors affecting property and casualty results including, among other factors, the level of catastrophe claims incurred, the amount of reserve development, the effect of changes in interest rates on investment income and the discounting of loss reserves, and the effect of realized gains and losses on investments.
contingencies legal proceedings for a discussion regarding contingencies related to the hartford's legal proceedings, please see the information contained under "litigation" and "asbestos and environmental claims," in note 14 - commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements and part ii, item 1 legal proceedings, which are incorporated herein by reference.
legislative and regulatory developments patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 (the "affordable care act") it is unclear whether the administration and congress will seek to amend or alter the ongoing operation of the affordable care act ("aca"). if such actions were to occur, they may have an impact on various aspects of our business, including our insurance businesses. it is unclear what an amended aca would entail, and to what extent there may be a transition period for the phase out of the aca. the impact to the hartford as an employer would be consistent with other large employers. the hartford's core business does not involve the issuance of health insurance, and we have not observed any material impacts on the company's workers'
compensation business or group benefits business from the enactment of the aca. we will continue to monitor the impact of the aca and any reforms on consumer, broker and medical provider behavior for leading indicators of changes in medical costs or loss payments primarily on the company's workers' compensation and disability liabilities.
united states department of labor fiduciary rule on april 6, 2016, the u.s. department of labor ("dol") issued a final regulation expanding the range of activities considered to be fiduciary investment advice under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 ("erisa") and the internal revenue code. while implementation of the rule was to be phased in, the dol has since delayed those dates. based on comments received, the dol has delayed the transition period to july 1, 2019. dol intends to continue coordination with the sec and other regulators, including state insurance regulators.
the impact of the new regulation on our mutual fund business is difficult to assess because the regulation is new and is still being studied. while we continue to analyze the regulation, we believe the regulation may impact the compensation paid to the financial intermediaries who sell our mutual funds to their retirement clients and could negatively impact our mutual funds business.
in 2016, several plaintiffs, including insurers and industry groups such as the u.s. chamber of commerce and the securities industry and financial markets association (sifma), filed a lawsuit against the dol challenging the constitutionality of the fiduciary rule, and the dol's rulemaking authority. in most cases, the district courts have entered a summary judgment in favor of the dol. certain cases were appealed to the fifth circuit and on july 5, 2017, the dol filed a brief in support of upholding the rule. we continue to monitor potential effects of case law and the regulatory landscape on our mutual funds business.
tax reform at the end of 2017, congress passed and the president signed, the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 ("tax reform"), which enacted significant reforms to the u.s. tax code. the major areas of interest to the company include the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax (amt) and the refunding of amt credits. we continue to analyze tax reform for other potential impacts. the u.s. treasury and irs will develop guidance implementing tax reform, and congress may consider additional technical corrections to the legislation. tax proposals and regulatory initiatives which have been or are being considered by congress and/or the u.s. treasury department could have a material effect on the company and its insurance businesses. the nature and timing of any congressional or regulatory action with respect to any such efforts is unclear. for additional information on risks to the company related to tax reform, please see the risk factor entitled "changes in federal or state tax laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity" under "risk factors" in part i.

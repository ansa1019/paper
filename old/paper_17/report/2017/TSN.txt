item 1a. risk factors these risks, which should be considered carefully with the information provided elsewhere in this report, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
fluctuations in commodity prices and in the availability of raw materials, especially feed grains, live cattle, live swine and other inputs could negatively impact our earnings.
our results of operations and financial condition, as well as the selling prices for our products, are dependent upon the cost and supply of commodities and raw materials such as beef, pork, poultry, corn, soybean, packaging materials and energy and, to a lesser extent, cheese, fruit, seasoning blends, flour, corn syrup, corn oils, butter and sugar. corn, soybean meal and other feed ingredients, for instance, represented roughly 55% of our cost of growing a live chicken in fiscal 2017. production and pricing of these commodities are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand over which we have limited or no control. such factors include, among other things, weather patterns throughout the world, outbreaks of disease, the global level of supply inventories and demand for grains and other feed ingredients, as well as agricultural and energy policies of domestic and foreign governments.
volatility in our commodity and raw material costs directly impact our gross margin and profitability. the company's objective is to offset commodity price increases with pricing actions over time. however, we may not be able to increase our product prices enough to sufficiently offset increased raw material costs due to consumer price sensitivity or the pricing postures of our competitors. in addition, if we increase prices to offset higher costs, we could experience lower demand for our products and sales volumes. conversely, decreases in our commodity and other input costs may create pressure on us to decrease our prices. while we use derivative financial instruments, primarily futures and options, to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity, we do not fully hedge against changes in commodities prices.
6
over time, if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs, to offset operating cost increases with continuous improvement savings or are not successful in our commodity hedging program, then commodity and raw material price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our profitability, financial condition and results of operations.
the prices we receive for our products may fluctuate due to competition from other food producers and processors.
the food industry in general is intensely competitive. we face competition from other food producers and processors that have various product ranges and geographic reach. some of the factors on which we compete include: pricing, product safety and quality, brand identification, innovation, breadth and depth of product offerings, availability of our products (including distribution channels used, such as e-commerce) and competing products, customer service, and credit terms.
from time to time in response to these competitive pressures or to maintain market share, we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products or increase or reallocate spending on marketing, advertising and promotions and new product innovation. such pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices in response to raw material and other cost increases. any reduction in prices as a result of competitive pressures, or any failure to increase prices to offset cost increases, could harm our profit margins. if we reduce prices but we cannot increase sales volumes to offset the price changes, then our financial condition and results of operations will suffer. alternatively, if we do not reduce our prices and our competitors seek advantage through pricing or promotional changes, our revenues and market share could be adversely affected.
outbreaks of livestock diseases can adversely impact our ability to conduct our operations and the supply and demand for our products.
supply of and demand for our products can be adversely impacted by outbreaks of livestock diseases, which can have a significant impact on our financial results. efforts are taken to control disease risks by adherence to good production practices and extensive precautionary measures designed to ensure the health of livestock. however, outbreaks of disease and other events, which may be beyond our control, either in our own livestock or livestock owned by independent producers who sell livestock to us, could significantly affect demand for our products, consumer perceptions of certain protein products, the availability of livestock for purchase by us and our ability to conduct our operations. moreover, the outbreak of livestock diseases, particularly in our chicken segment, could have a significant effect on the livestock we own by requiring us to, among other things, destroy any affected livestock. furthermore, an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our products to or from our suppliers, facilities or customers. this could also result in negative publicity that may have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our financial results.
the integration of advancepierre may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, and the acquisition may not result in any or all of the anticipated benefits, including cost synergies.
the success of the acquisition of advancepierre, including the realization of the anticipated benefits, will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate advancepierre's businesses in an efficient and effective manner. we may not be able to accomplish this integration process smoothly or successfully. the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities and addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration. failure to effectively integrate the businesses could adversely impact the expected benefits of the acquisition, including cost synergies arising from supply chain efficiencies, merchandising activities and overlapping general and administrative functions.
the integration of two large companies is complex, and we will be required to devote significant management attention and incur substantial costs to integrate advancepierre's and tyson's business practices, policies, cultures and operations. this diversion of our management's attention from day-to-day business operations and the execution and pursuit of strategic plans and initiatives could result in performance shortfalls, which could adversely impact the combined company's business, operations and financial results. the integration process could also result in the loss of key employees, which could adversely impact the combined company's future financial results.
furthermore, during the integration planning process, we may encounter additional challenges and difficulties, including those related to, without limitation, managing a larger combined company; streamlining supply chains, consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating overlapping operations; retaining our existing vendors and customers; unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems; and unforeseen and unexpected liabilities related to the acquisition of advancepierre. delays encountered in the integration could adversely impact the business, financial condition and operations of the combined company.
we continue to evaluate our estimates of synergies to be realized from the advancepierre acquisition and refine them. our actual cost savings could differ materially from our current estimates. actual cost savings, the costs required to realize the cost savings and the source of the cost savings could differ materially from our estimates, and we cannot assure you that we will achieve the full amount of cost savings on the schedule anticipated or at all or that these cost savings programs will not have other adverse effects on our business. in light of these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on our estimated cost savings.
7
finally, we may not be able to achieve the targeted operating or long-term strategic benefits of the advancepierre acquisition in a timely manner or at all or could incur higher transition costs than anticipated. an inability to realize the full extent of, or any of, the anticipated benefits of the advancepierre acquisition, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
we may not realize any or all of the anticipated benefits of our financial fitness program, which may prove to be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, our board of directors approved a multi-year restructuring program (the "financial fitness program"), which is expected to contribute to the company's overall strategy of financial fitness through increased operational effectiveness and overhead reduction. for more information regarding this program, refer to the heading "overview" set forth in part ii, "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of this report.
the success of the financial fitness program, including the realization of the anticipated benefits, will depend in part on our ability to successfully implement the program in an efficient and effective manner. the implementation of the financial fitness program may be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected, and the financial fitness program may not result in any or all of the anticipated benefits. if we are unable to implement the financial fitness program smoothly or successfully, or we otherwise do not capture the anticipated savings, our business, results of operations and financial condition for future periods could be negatively impacted.
in addition, we may incur higher costs associated with reductions in overhead than anticipated, and the reduction in overhead could result in performance shortfalls. the financial fitness program may become a distraction for our organization and may disrupt our ongoing business operations; cause deterioration in employee morale; disrupt or weaken the internal control structures of the affected business operations; and result in negative publicity which could affect our corporate reputation. if we are unable to successfully manage the negative consequences of the financial fitness program, our business, results of operations and financial condition for future periods could be adversely affected.
we may experience difficulties in implementing an enterprise resource planning system over the next few years.
we are engaged in a multi-year implementation of an enterprise resource planning ("erp") system. such an implementation is a major undertaking from a financial, management, and personnel perspective. the implementation of the erp system may prove to be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected, and there can be no assurance that this system will continue to be beneficial to the extent anticipated. any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of our new erp system could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship products, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations, produce financial reports, or otherwise operate our business. as we implement our new erp system, our exposure to system attacks may be elevated because we will be running old and new processes in parallel and must simultaneously protect both the new system and legacy systems. if we are unable to implement the erp system smoothly or successfully, or we otherwise do not capture anticipated benefits, our business, results of operations and financial condition for future periods could be negatively impacted. additionally, our implementation of the erp system may involve greater utilization of third-party "cloud" computing services in connection with our business operations. problems faced by us or our third-party "cloud" computing providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats, could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition for future periods.
we are subject to risks associated with our international activities, which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries, as well as our operations and assets in such countries.
in fiscal 2017, we sold products to approximately 117 countries. major sales markets include canada, central america, china, the european union, japan, mexico, the middle east, south korea and taiwan. our sales to customers in foreign countries for fiscal 2017 totaled $4.5 billion, of which $3.9 billion related to export sales from the united states. in addition, we had approximately $217 million of long-lived assets located in foreign countries, primarily brazil, china, european union and india, at the end of fiscal 2017.
as a result, we are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including:
•   imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other trade protection measures imposed by foreign countries regarding the importation of beef, pork, poultry, and prepared foods products, in addition to import or export licensing requirements imposed by various foreign countries;
•   closing of borders by foreign countries to the import of beef, pork, and poultry products due to animal disease or other perceived health or safety issues;
•   impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the united states dollar and foreign currencies, particularly the brazilian real, the british pound sterling, the canadian dollar, the chinese renminbi, the european euro, the japanese yen and the mexican peso;
•   political and economic conditions;
•   difficulties and costs to comply with, and enforcement of remedies under, a wide variety of complex domestic and international laws, treaties and regulations, including, without limitation, the united states foreign corrupt practices act and economic and trade sanctions enforced by the united states department of the treasury's office of foreign assets control;
8
•   different regulatory structures and unexpected changes in regulatory environments;
•   tax rates that may exceed those in the united states and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and incremental taxes upon repatriation;
•   potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; and
•   distribution costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation.
negative consequences relating to these risks and uncertainties could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business in one or more of those markets where we operate or in other developing markets and could adversely affect our financial results.
we depend on the availability of, and good relations with, our employees.
we have approximately 122,000 employees, approximately 35,000 of whom are covered by collective bargaining agreements or are members of labor unions. our operations depend on the availability and relative costs of labor and maintaining good relations with employees and the labor unions. if we fail to maintain good relations with our employees or with the labor unions, we may experience labor strikes or work stoppages, which could adversely affect our financial results.
if we are unable to attract, hire or retain key employees or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce, it could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
our continued growth requires us to attract, hire, retain and develop key employees, including our executive officers and senior management team, and maintain a highly skilled and diverse global workforce. we compete to attract and hire highly skilled employees and our own employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies. competition could cause us to lose talented employees, and unplanned turnover could deplete our institutional knowledge and result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees.
we depend on contract growers and independent producers to supply us with livestock.
we contract primarily with independent contract growers to raise the live chickens and turkeys processed in our poultry operations. a majority of our cattle and hogs are purchased from independent producers who sell livestock to us under marketing contracts or on the open market. if we do not attract and maintain contracts with growers or maintain marketing and purchasing relationships with independent producers, our production operations could be negatively affected.
if our products become contaminated, we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls, which could adversely affect our financial results and damage our reputation.
our products may be subject to contamination by disease-producing organisms or pathogens, such as listeria monocytogenes, salmonella and e. coli. these organisms and pathogens are found generally in the environment and there is a risk that one or more, as a result of food processing, could be present in our products. these organisms and pathogens also can be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling at the further-processing, foodservice or consumer level. these risks may be controlled, but may not be eliminated, by adherence to good manufacturing practices and finished product testing. we have little, if any, control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution. even an inadvertent shipment of contaminated products may be a violation of law and may lead to increased risk of exposure to product liability claims, increased scrutiny and penalties, including injunctive relief and plant closings, by federal and state regulatory agencies, and adverse publicity, which could exacerbate the associated negative consumer reaction. any of these occurrences may have an adverse effect on our financial results. in addition, we may be required to recall some of our products if they spoil, become contaminated, are tampered with or are mislabeled. a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. such a product recall also could result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands.
changes in consumer preference and failure to maintain favorable consumer perception of our brands and products could negatively impact our business.
the food industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends, demands and preferences. trends within the food industry change often, and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to, among other things, reduced demand and price reductions for our brands and products. we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations, but we may not be successful in our efforts.
we could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients, or the food safety system generally. prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products or ingredients or loss of confidence in the food safety system generally could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs. continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.
9
we have a number of iconic brands with significant value. maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business. brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences or the products becoming unavailable to consumers.
failure to continually innovate and successfully launch new products and maintain our brand image through marketing investment could adversely impact our operating results.
our financial success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences, purchasing behaviors and dietary habits and successfully developing and launching new products and product extensions that consumers want in the channels where they shop. we devote significant resources to new product development and product extensions, however we may not be successful in developing innovative new products or our new products may not be commercially successful. to the extent we are not able to effectively gauge the direction of our key markets and successfully identify, develop, manufacture and market new or improved products in these changing markets, such as adapting to emerging e-commerce channels, our financial results and our competitive position will suffer. in addition, our introduction of new products or product extensions may generate litigation or other legal proceedings against us by competitors claiming infringement of their intellectual property or other rights, which could negatively impact our results of operations.
we also seek to maintain and extend the image of our brands through marketing investments, including advertising, consumer promotions and trade spend. due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising, promotions and new product introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance, our marketing investments may not prove successful in maintaining or increasing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits. continuing global focus on health and wellness, including weight management, and increasing media attention to the role of food marketing could adversely affect our brand image or lead to stricter regulations and greater scrutiny of food marketing practices.
our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image also depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. the growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. negative posts or comments about us, our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our reputation and brand image.
we are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions on how and to whom we market our products, for instance marketing to children, which may limit our ability to maintain or extend our brand image. if we do not maintain or extend our brand image, then our product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
failure to leverage our brand value propositions to compete against private label products, especially during economic downturn, may adversely affect our profitability.
in many product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with private label products that generally are sold at lower prices. consumers are more likely to purchase our products if they believe that our products provide a higher quality and greater value than less expensive alternatives. if the difference in quality between our brands and private label products narrows, or if there is a perception of such a narrowing, consumers may choose not to buy our products at prices that are profitable for us. in addition, in periods of economic uncertainty, consumers tend to purchase more lower-priced private label or other economy brands. to the extent this occurs, we could experience a reduction in the sales volume of our higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings. in addition, in times of economic uncertainty, consumers reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at our foodservice customers, which in turn reduces our product sales.
our level of indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could negatively impact our business and liquidity position.
our indebtedness, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, may increase from time to time for various reasons, including fluctuations in operating results, working capital needs, capital expenditures and possible acquisitions, joint ventures or other significant initiatives. our consolidated indebtedness level could adversely affect our business because:
•   it may limit or impair our ability to obtain financing in the future;
•   our credit ratings (or any decrease to our credit ratings) could restrict or impede our ability to access capital markets at desired interest rates and increase our borrowing costs;
•   it may reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to take advantage of business opportunities that may arise;
•   a portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to interest payments on our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes; and
•   it may restrict our ability to pay dividends.
10
our revolving credit and term loan facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens and encumbrances; incur debt; merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate; make acquisitions and investments; dispose of or transfer assets; change the nature of our business; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and enter into hedging transactions, in each case, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. in addition, we are required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum debt to capitalization ratios.
our senior notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens; engage in certain sale/leaseback transactions; and engage in certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.
an impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. in assessing the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, we make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, royalty rates, ebitda multiples, and discount rates based on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying these factors. goodwill valuations have been calculated principally using an income approach. the income approach is based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. indefinite life intangible asset valuations have been calculated principally using relief-from-royalty and excess earnings approaches and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. under these valuation approaches, we are required to make various judgmental assumptions about appropriate discount rates. disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions, could, among other things, cause us to increase the discount rate used in the valuations. we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines. these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in impairment charges in the future, which could be substantial. as of september 30, 2017, we had $13.4 billion of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, which represented approximately 48% of total assets.
new or more stringent domestic and international government regulations could impose material costs on us and could adversely affect our business.
our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and foreign laws and regulations by authorities that oversee food safety standards and processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling and export of our products. see "environmental regulation and food safety" in item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected. for example, increased governmental interest in advertising practices may result in regulations that could require us to change or restrict our advertising practices.
increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us. we use natural gas, diesel fuel and electricity in the manufacturing and distribution of our products. legislation or regulation affecting these inputs could materially affect our profitability. in addition, climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience and may require us to make additional unplanned capital expenditures.
legal claims, class action lawsuits, other regulatory enforcement actions, or failure to comply with applicable legal standards or requirements could affect our product sales, reputation and profitability.
we operate in a highly-regulated environment with constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks. consequently, we are subject to heightened risk of legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions. although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies and procedures. moreover, a failure to maintain effective control processes could lead to violations, unintentional or otherwise, of laws and regulations. legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including those contained in item 3, legal proceedings and part ii, item 8, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 20: commitments and contingencies in this annual report on form 10-k, could subject us to civil and criminal penalties, including debarment from governmental contracts that could materially and adversely affect our product sales, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent us from meeting current product demand, introducing new products, building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect operating results.
11
the company is subject to stringent environmental regulation and potentially subject to environmental litigation, proceedings, and investigations.
our past and present business operations and ownership and operation of real property are subject to stringent federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, and the handling and disposition of wastes (including solid and hazardous wastes) or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. compliance with these laws and regulations, and the ability to comply with any modifications to these laws and regulations, is material to our business. new matters or sites may be identified in the future that will require additional investigation, assessment, or expenditures. in addition, some of our facilities have been in operation for many years and, over time, we and other prior operators of these facilities may have generated and disposed of wastes that now may be considered hazardous. future discovery of contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of our present or former properties or manufacturing facilities and/or waste disposal sites could require us to incur additional expenses. the occurrence of any of these events, the implementation of new laws and regulations, or stricter interpretation of existing laws or regulations, could adversely affect our financial results.
we are increasingly dependent on information technology, and our business and reputation could suffer if we are unable to protect our information technology systems against, or effectively respond to, cyber-attacks, other cyber incidents or security breaches or if our information technology systems are otherwise disrupted.
information technology is an important part of our business operations and we increasingly rely on information technology systems to manage business data and increase efficiencies in our production and distribution facilities and inventory management processes. we also use information technology to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. in addition, we depend on information technology for digital marketing and electronic communications between our facilities, personnel, customers and suppliers. like other companies, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of disruptions, including but not limited to the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, hackers, unauthorized access attempts and other security issues. attempted cyber-attacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise.
we have implemented and continue to evaluate security initiatives and disaster recovery plans to mitigate our exposure to these risks, but these measures may not be adequate. any significant failure of our systems, including failures that prevent our systems from functioning as intended or our failure to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyber-attacks or other cyber incidents, could cause transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, loss of customers and sales, have negative consequences on our employees and our business partners, have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation and expose us to liability, litigation and regulatory enforcement actions. in addition, if we are unable to prevent security breaches, we may suffer financial and reputational damage or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our business partners, customers, consumers or suppliers. finally, the disclosure of non-public information through external media channels could lead to the loss of intellectual property or damage our reputation and brand image. similar risks exist with respect to the third-party vendors that we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions, including health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions, and systems managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties and their vendors.
if we pursue strategic acquisitions or divestitures, we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses.
we periodically evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures and other initiatives, and may seek to expand our business through the acquisition of companies, processing plants, technologies, products and services. acquisitions and joint ventures involve financial and operational risks and uncertainties, including:
•   challenges in realizing the anticipated benefits of the transaction;
•   difficulty integrating acquired businesses, technologies, operations and personnel with our existing business;
•   diversion of management attention in connection with negotiating transactions and integrating the businesses acquired;
•   difficulty identifying suitable candidates or consummating a transaction on terms that are favorable to us;
•   challenges in retaining the acquired businesses' customers and key employees;
•   inability to implement and maintain consistent standards, controls, procedures and information systems;
•   exposure to unforeseen or undisclosed liabilities of acquired companies; and
•   the availability and terms of additional debt or equity financing for any transaction.
we may not be able to address these risks and successfully develop these acquired companies or businesses into profitable units. if we are unable to do this, such expansion could adversely affect our financial results.
12
additionally, from time to time, we may divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets. we may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us. gains or losses on the sales of, or lost operating income from, those businesses may affect our profitability and margins. moreover, we may incur asset impairment charges related to divestitures that reduce our profitability. our divestiture activities may present financial, managerial and operational risks. those risks include diversion of management attention from existing businesses, difficulties separating personnel and financial and other systems, possible need for providing transition services to buyers, adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers. any of these factors could adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations. on april 24, 2017, we announced our intent to sell three non-protein businesses, sara lee® frozen bakery, kettle and van's®, which are all a part of our prepared foods segment, as part of our strategic focus on protein-packed brands. we anticipate we will close the transactions by the end of calendar 2017.
market fluctuations could negatively impact our operating results as we hedge certain transactions.
our business is exposed to fluctuating market conditions. we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to various market risks including changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. we hold certain positions, primarily in grain and livestock futures, that do not qualify as hedges for financial reporting purposes. these positions are marked to fair value, and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date. therefore, losses on these contracts will adversely affect our reported operating results. while these contracts reduce our exposure to changes in prices for commodity products, the use of such instruments may ultimately limit our ability to benefit from favorable commodity prices.
deterioration of economic conditions could negatively impact our business.
our business may be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, access to capital markets, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs (including fuel surcharges) and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. any such changes could adversely affect the demand for our products, or the cost and availability of our needed raw materials, cooking ingredients and packaging materials, thereby negatively affecting our financial results.
disruptions in global credit and other financial markets and deterioration of economic conditions could, among other things:
•   make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or to refinance our debt in the future;
•   cause our lenders to depart from prior credit industry practice and make more difficult or expensive the granting of any amendment of, or waivers under, our credit agreements to the extent we may seek them in the future;
•   impair the financial condition of some of our customers and suppliers, thereby increasing customer bad debts or non-performance by suppliers;
•   negatively impact global demand for protein products, which could result in a reduction of sales, operating income and cash flows;
•   decrease the value of our investments in equity and debt securities, including our marketable debt securities, company-owned life insurance and pension and other postretirement plan assets;
•   negatively impact our commodity purchasing activities if we are required to record losses related to derivative financial instruments; or
•   impair the financial viability of our insurers.
the loss of one or more of our largest customers could negatively impact our business.
our business could suffer significant setbacks in sales and operating income if our customers' plans and/or markets change significantly or if we lost one or more of our largest customers, including, for example, wal-mart stores, inc., which accounted for 17.3% of our sales in fiscal 2017. our retail customers typically do not enter into written contracts, and if they do sign contracts, they generally are limited in scope and duration. there can be no assurance that significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past. alternative retail channels, such as convenience stores, dollar stores, drug stores, club stores and internet-based retailers have increased their market share. this trend towards alternative channels is expected to continue in the future. if we are not successful in expanding sales in alternative retail channels, our business or financial results may be adversely impacted. many of our customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs and food distributors, have consolidated in recent years, and consolidation is expected to continue throughout the united states and in other major markets. these consolidations have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories, opposing price increases, and demanding lower pricing, increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products. these customers also may use shelf space currently used for our products for their own private label products. because of these trends, our volume growth could slow or we may need to lower prices or increase promotional spending for our products. the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to, or adverse change to trade terms with, a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.
13
extreme factors or forces beyond our control could negatively impact our business.
our ability to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. natural disasters, fire, bioterrorism, pandemic or extreme weather, including droughts, floods, excessive cold or heat, hurricanes or other storms, could impair the health or growth of livestock or interfere with our operations due to power outages, fuel shortages, decrease in availability of water, damage to our production and processing facilities or disruption of transportation channels or unfavorably impact the demand for, or our consumers' ability to purchase our products, among other things. any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our financial results.
failure to maximize or to successfully assert our intellectual property rights could impact our competitiveness.
we consider our intellectual property rights, particularly and most notably our trademarks, but also our trade secrets, patents and copyrights, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws, as well as licensing agreements, third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. we cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted. there is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions.
we cannot be sure that these rights, if obtained, will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future. in addition, even if such rights are obtained in the united states, the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states. our failure to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
participation in a multiemployer pension plan could adversely affect our business.
through our wholly owned subsidiary, hillshire brands, we participate in a "multiemployer" pension plan administered by a labor union representing some of its employees. we are required to make periodic contributions to this plan to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants. our required contributions to this fund could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to this fund, inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. in the event that we withdraw from participation in this plan, then applicable law could require us to make an additional lump-sum contribution to the plan, and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. our withdrawal liability would depend on the extent of the plan's funding of vested benefits. the multiemployer plan in which we participate is reported to have significant underfunded liabilities. such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability. in the event a withdrawal or partial withdrawal was to occur with respect to the multiemployer plan, the impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material.
tyson limited partnership can exercise significant control.
as of september 30, 2017, tyson limited partnership (the "tlp") owns 99.985% of the outstanding shares of the company's class b common stock, $0.10 par value (class b stock) and the tlp and members of the tyson family own, in the aggregate, 2.07% of the outstanding shares of the company's class a common stock, $0.10 par value (class a stock), giving them, collectively, control of approximately 70.78% of the total voting power of the company's outstanding voting stock. at this time, the tlp does not have a managing general partner, as such, the management rights of the managing general partner may be exercised by a majority of the percentage interests of the general partners. as of september 30, 2017, mr. john tyson, chairman of the board of directors, has 33.33% of the general partner percentage interests, and ms. barbara tyson, a director of the company, has 11.115% general partner percentage interests (the remaining general partnership interests are held by the donald j. tyson revocable trust (44.44%) and harry c. erwin, iii (11.115%)). as a result of these holdings, positions and directorships, the partners in the tlp have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over our management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by our stockholders, including amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws, the election and removal of directors, any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions. this concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change in control otherwise favored by our other stockholders and could depress our stock price. additionally, as a result of the tlp's significant ownership of our outstanding voting stock, we are eligible for "controlled company" exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements of the new york stock exchange.
we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax liabilities.
we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. our total income tax expense could be affected by changes in tax rates in various jurisdictions, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities. there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties, which could adversely affect our financial results.

volatility in the capital markets or interest rates could adversely impact our pension costs and the funded status of our pension plans.
we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states. the difference between plan obligations and assets, which signifies the funded status of the plans, is a significant factor in determining the net periodic benefit costs of the pension plans and our ongoing funding requirements. as of september 30, 2017, the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans was an underfunded position of $195 million, as compared to an underfunded position of $336 million at the end of fiscal 2016. changes in interest rates and the market value of plan assets can impact the funded status of the plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and our future funding requirements. the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors, including minimum funding requirements.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations description of the company we are one of the world's largest food companies and a recognized leader in protein. founded in 1935 by john w. tyson and grown under three generations of family leadership, the company has a broad portfolio of products and brands like tyson®, jimmy dean®, hillshire farm®, ball park®, wright®, aidells®, ibp® and state fair®. some of the key factors influencing our business are customer demand for our products; the ability to maintain and grow relationships with customers and introduce new and innovative products to the marketplace; accessibility of international markets; market prices for our products; the cost and availability of live cattle and hogs, raw materials and feed ingredients; and operating efficiencies of our facilities.
we operate in four reportable segments: beef, pork, chicken, and prepared foods. other primarily includes our foreign chicken production operations in china and india, third-party merger and integration costs and corporate overhead related to tyson new ventures, llc.
on june 7, 2017, we acquired and consolidated advancepierre foods holdings, inc. ("advancepierre"), a producer and distributor of value-added, convenient, ready-to-eat sandwiches, sandwich components and other entrées and snacks. advancepierre's results from operations subsequent to the acquisition closing are included in the prepared foods and chicken segments.
overview
•   fiscal year - our accounting cycle resulted in a 52-week year for both fiscal 2017 and 2016 and a 53-week year for fiscal 2015.
•   general - our fiscal 2017 operating income grew 3% compared to fiscal 2016 to a record $2,931 million, which was led by record earnings in our beef and pork segments. the beef segment's operating income improved $530 million and the pork segment improved $117 million in fiscal 2017 due to favorable market conditions and strong operational execution. our chicken segment's lower operating income was impacted by increased operating costs and $56 million of restructuring and related charges. our prepared foods segment's lower operating income was impacted by increased operating costs, impairments of $52 million related to our san diego prepared foods operation and $45 million related to the expected sale of a non-protein business and $82 million of restructuring and related charges. in addition, we incurred an incremental $95 million of compensation and benefit integration expense in fiscal 2017, as we continued to integrate and make investments in our talent, and incurred $85 million of advancepierre purchase accounting and acquisition related operating costs. sales increased 4% in fiscal 2017 over fiscal 2016, primarily due to increased sales volumes and increased beef, pork and chicken prices, as well as the net incremental impact of advancepierre's sales of $508 million.
•   market environment - according to the united states department of agriculture (usda), domestic protein production (beef, pork, chicken and turkey) increased approximately 3% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. the beef segment experienced strong export demand and more favorable domestic market conditions associated with an increase in cattle supply. the pork segment had favorable market conditions associated with strong demand for our pork products and improved export markets. there was stronger demand for our chicken products and reduced feed ingredient costs of $80 million, which benefited the chicken segment. our prepared foods segment had improved demand for our retail products but experienced a decline in foodservice and higher input costs of $50 million.
•   margins - our total operating margin was 7.7% in fiscal 2017. operating margins by segment were as follows:
•   beef - 5.9%
•   pork - 12.3%
•   chicken -9.2% (included $56 million of restructuring and related charges)
•   prepared foods - 5.9% (included $52 million impairment related to our san diego prepared foods operation, $45 million impairment related to the expected sale of a non-protein business, $82 million of restructuring and related charges and $34 million of purchase accounting and acquisition related costs from the acquisition of advancepierre.)
•   hillshire integration - the impact of the the hillshire brands company ("hillshire brands") synergies, along with the profit improvement plan related to our legacy prepared foods business, had a positive incremental impact of approximately $90 million in fiscal 2017 above the $258 million captured in fiscal 2016 and $322 million captured in fiscal 2015, for a total of $670 million of synergies realized. the majority of these benefits were realized in the prepared foods segment and were partially used to invest in innovation, new product launches and supporting the growth of our brands.
•   liquidity - during fiscal 2017, we generated $2.6 billion of operating cash flows. at september 30, 2017, we had $1.0 billion of liquidity, which included $318 million of cash and cash equivalents and the availability under our revolving credit facility after deducting amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program.

•   strategy - in fiscal 2017, we announced our strategy to sustainably feed the world with the fastest growing portfolio of protein-packed brands. we intend to accomplish this by growing our portfolio of protein-packed brands and delivering food at scale, which will be enabled by driving profitable growth with and for our customers through differentiated capabilities and creating fuel for reinvestment through a disciplined financial fitness model.
•   on june 7, 2017, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of advancepierre as part of our overall strategy. the purchase price was equal to $40.25 per share in cash for advancepierre's outstanding common stock, or approximately $3.2 billion. we funded the acquisition with existing cash on hand, net proceeds from the issuance of new senior notes, as well as borrowings under our commercial paper program and new term loan facility. advancepierre's results from operations subsequent to the acquisition closing are included in the prepared foods and chicken segments. for further description refer to part ii, item 8, notes to the consolidated financial statements, note 3: acquisition and dispositions.
•   on april 24, 2017, we announced our intent to sell three non-protein businesses, sara lee® frozen bakery, kettle and van's®, which are all included in our prepared foods segment, as part of our strategic focus on protein-packed brands. we have reclassified the assets and liabilities related to these businesses to assets and liabilities held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of september 30, 2017. in the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded an impairment charge totaling $45 million related to one of these businesses due to a revised estimate of the business' fair value based on current expected net sales proceeds. the impairment charge was recorded in cost of sales in our consolidated statement of income for fiscal 2017, and consisted of goodwill and intangible assets previously classified within assets held for sale. we anticipate we will close the transactions by the end of calendar 2017, or early calendar 2018, and expect to record a net pretax gain as a result of the sale of these businesses. for further description refer to part ii, item 8, notes to the consolidated financial statements, note 3: acquisition and dispositions.
•   in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, our board of directors approved a multi-year restructuring program (the "financial fitness program"), which is expected to contribute to the company's overall strategy of financial fitness through increased operational effectiveness and overhead reduction. through a combination of synergies from the integration of advancepierre and additional elimination of non-valued added costs, the financial fitness program is estimated to result in cumulative net savings of $200 million in fiscal 2018, $400 million in fiscal 2019 including new savings of $200 million, and $600 million in fiscal 2020 including additional savings of $200 million. approximately 50-60% of these net savings, which are focused on supply chain, procurement, and overhead improvements, are expected to be realized in the prepared foods segment with the majority of the remaining net savings impacting the chicken segment. additionally, we estimate that approximately 75% of the net savings will be reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statement of income, with the remaining in selling, general and administrative.
as part of the financial fitness program, we anticipate eliminating approximately 500 positions across several areas and job levels with most of the eliminated positions originating from the corporate offices in springdale, arkansas; chicago, illinois; and cincinnati, ohio. as a result, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the company recognized restructuring and related charges of $150 million that consisted of $53 million severance and employee related costs, $72 million technology impairment and related costs, and $25 million for contract termination costs. the company currently anticipates the financial fitness program will result in cumulative pretax charges, once implemented, of approximately $215 million which consist primarily of severance and employee related costs, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation, incremental costs to implement new technology, and contract termination costs. the following tables set forth the pretax impact of restructuring and related charges incurred in fiscal 2017 in the consolidated statements of income and the pretax impact by our reportable segments. for further description refer to part ii, item 8, notes to the consolidated financial statements, note 6: restructuring and related charges.

2017 vs. 2016 -
•   sales volume - sales were positively impacted by an increase in sales volume, which accounted for an increase of $477
million. each segment had an increase in sales volume with the beef and prepared foods segments contributing to the majority of the increase driven by better demand for our beef products and incremental volumes from the acquisition of advancepierre.
•   average sales price - sales were positively impacted by higher average sales prices, which accounted for an increase of $902 million. each segment had an increase in average sales price with the pork, chicken and prepared foods segments contributing to the majority of the increase due to strong demand for our pork products, improved mix and higher chicken pricing in our chicken segment and better product mix in our prepared foods segment which was positively impacted by the acquisition of advancepierre.
•   the above amounts include a net increase of $508 million related to the inclusion of advancepierre results post acquisition.
2016 vs. 2015 -
•   sales volume - sales were negatively impacted by lower sales volume, which accounted for a decrease of $1.9 billion. each segment had a decline in sales volume primarily attributed to the additional week in fiscal 2015. the decrease in sales volume was also attributable to the divestitures of the mexico and brazil chicken production operations in fiscal 2015. when excluding these impacts along with the divestiture of our heinold hog markets business in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, total company sales volume increased 0.1%.
•   average sales price - sales were negatively impacted by lower average sales prices, which accounted for a decrease of $2.6 billion. each segment had a decrease in average sales prices largely due to decreased pricing associated with lower beef, pork, and chicken prices, with the largest decrease in the beef segment.

capital resources credit facility cash flows from operating activities and current cash on hand are our primary sources of liquidity for funding debt service, capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases. we also have a revolving credit facility, with a committed capacity of $1.5 billion, to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs, letters of credit and to backstop our commercial paper program. as of september 30, 2017, we had no outstanding borrowings and $8 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under this facility, none of which were drawn upon, which left $1,492 million available for borrowing. our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of 41 banks, with commitments ranging from $0.3 million to $106 million per bank. the syndicate includes bank holding companies that are required to be adequately capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency requirements.
commercial paper program our commercial paper program provides a low-cost source of borrowing to fund general corporate purposes including working capital requirements. the maximum borrowing capacity under the commercial paper program is $800 million. the maturities of the notes may vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issuance. as of september 30, 2017, $778 million was outstanding under this program with maturities less than 45 days.
capitalization to monitor our credit ratings and our capacity for long-term financing, we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors. we monitor the ratio of our net debt to ebitda as support for our long-term financing decisions. at september 30, 2017, and october 1, 2016, the ratio of our net debt to ebitda was 2.7x and 1.7x, respectively. refer to part ii, item 6, selected financial data, for an explanation and reconciliation to comparable gaap measures. the increase in this ratio for fiscal 2017 is primarily a result of the incremental debt from the advancepierre acquisition.

in the event the rating levels are split, the applicable fees and spread will be based upon the rating level in effect for two of the rating agencies, or, if all three rating agencies have different rating levels, the applicable fees and spread will be based upon the rating level that is between the rating levels of the other two rating agencies.

debt covenants our revolving credit and term loan facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens and encumbrances; incur debt; merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate; make acquisitions and investments; dispose of or transfer assets; change the nature of our business; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and enter into hedging transactions, in each case, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. in addition, we are required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum debt-to-capitalization ratios.
our senior notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens; engage in certain sale/leaseback transactions; and engage in certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.
we were in compliance with all debt covenants at september 30, 2017.
pension plans as further described in part ii, item 8, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 15: pensions and other postretirement benefits, the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is defined as the amount the projected benefit obligation exceeds the plan assets. the funded status of the plans is an underfunded position of $195 million at the end of fiscal 2017 as compared to an underfunded position of $336 million at the end of fiscal 2016.
we expect to contribute approximately $38 million of cash to our pension plans in fiscal 2018 as compared to approximately $53 million in fiscal 2017 and $64 million in fiscal 2016. the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors, including minimum funding requirements. as a result, the actual funding in fiscal 2018 may be different from the estimate.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements material to our financial position or results of operations. the off-balance sheet arrangements we have are guarantees of debt of outside third parties, including leases and grower loans, and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. see part ii, item 8, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 20: commitments and contingencies for further discussion.

(1)   in the event of a default on payment, acceleration of the principal payments could occur.
(2)   interest payments include interest on all outstanding debt. payments are estimated for variable rate and variable term debt based on effective interest rates at september 30, 2017, and expected payment dates.
(3)   amounts include guarantees of debt of outside third parties, which consist of leases and grower loans, all of which are substantially collateralized by the underlying assets, as well as residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. the amounts included are the maximum potential amount of future payments.
(4)   amounts include minimum lease payments under lease agreements.
(5)   amounts include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. the purchase obligations amount included items, such as future purchase commitments for grains, livestock contracts and fixed grower fees, that provide terms that meet the above criteria. for certain grain purchase commitments with a fixed quantity provision, we have assumed the future obligations under the commitment based on available commodity futures prices as published in observable active markets as of september 30, 2017. we have excluded future purchase commitments for contracts that do not meet these criteria. purchase orders are not included in the table, as a purchase order is an authorization to purchase and is cancelable. contracts for goods or services that contain termination clauses without penalty have also been excluded.
(6)   amounts include estimated amounts to complete buildings and equipment under construction as of september 30, 2017.
(7)   other long-term liabilities primarily consist of deferred compensation, deferred income, self-insurance, and asset retirement obligations. we are unable to reliably estimate the amount of these payments beyond fiscal 2018; therefore, we have only included the total liability in the table above. we also have employee benefit obligations consisting of pensions and other postretirement benefits of $258 million that are excluded from the table above. a discussion of the company's pension and postretirement plans, including funding matters, is included in part ii, item 8, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 15: pensions and other postretirement benefits.
in addition to the amounts shown above in the table, we have unrecognized tax benefits of $296 million and related interest and penalties of $63 million at september 30, 2017, recorded as liabilities.
the potential maximum contractual obligation associated with our cash flow assistance programs at september 30, 2017, based on the estimated fair values of the livestock supplier's net tangible assets on that date, aggregated to approximately $380 million. there were no receivables under these programs at september 30, 2017.
recently issued/adopted accounting pronouncements refer to the discussion under part ii, item 8, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 1: business and summary of significant accounting policies and note 2: changes in accounting principles.

critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates. the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical.

marketing, advertising and promotion costs we promote our products with marketing, advertising, trade promotions, and consumer incentives. these programs include, but are not limited to, coupons, discounts, rebates, volume-based incentives, cooperative advertising, and other programs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   recognition of the costs related to these programs contains uncertainties due to judgment required in estimating the potential performance, utilization and redemption rates of each program.                                                                                                                                                                                                        we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our marketing, advertising, and promotion accruals during the past three fiscal years.
marketing, advertising, and promotion costs are charged to operations in the period incurred. we accrue costs based on the estimated performance, historical utilization and redemption rates of each program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       these estimates are based on many factors, including experience of similar promotional programs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our marketing, advertising, and promotion accruals. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material.
cash consideration given to customers is considered a reduction in the price of our products, thus recorded as a reduction to sales. the remainder of marketing, advertising and promotion costs is recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            a 10% change in our marketing, advertising, and promotion accruals at september 30, 2017, would impact pretax earnings by approximately $15 million.

we use independent third-party actuaries to assist us in determining our pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost. we and the actuaries review assumptions that include estimates of the present value of the projected future pension payment to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. we accumulate and amortize the effect of actuarial gains and losses over future periods.   the key assumptions used in developing the required estimates include such factors as discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, retirement rates, and mortality. these assumptions can have a material impact upon the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, they are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore generally affect the net periodic benefit cost in future periods.
net periodic benefit cost for the defined benefit pension plans was $28 million in fiscal 2017. the projected benefit obligation was $1,707 million at the end of fiscal 2017. unrecognized actuarial gain was $44 million at the end of fiscal 2017. we currently expect net periodic benefit cost for fiscal 2018 to be approximately $15 million, excluding the pending settlement as described in note 15: pension and other postretirement benefits.                                             the discount rates were determined using a cash flow matching technique whereby the rates of a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities, were applied to the benefit obligations to determine the appropriate discount rate. in determining the long-term rate of return on plan assets, we first examined historical rates of return for the various asset classes within the plans. we then determined a long-term projected rate-of-return based on expected returns. investment, management and other fees paid out of plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality.   a 1% increase in the discount rate at september 30, 2017, would result in a decrease in the projected benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost of approximately $187 million and $19 million, respectively. a 1% decrease in the discount rate at september 30, 2017, would result in an increase in the projected benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost of approximately $229 million and $14 million, respectively.
plan assets are currently comprised of approximately 87% fixed income securities and 9% equity securities. fixed income securities can include, but are not limited to, direct bond investments and pooled or indirect bond investments. other investments may include, but are not limited to, international and domestic equities, real estate, commodities and private equity.                                                                                                                     it is reasonably likely that changes in external factors will result in changes to the assumptions used to measure pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost in future periods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   a 1% change in the return on plan assets at september 30, 2017, would impact the net periodic benefit cost by approximately $15 million.
we expect to contribute approximately $38 million of cash to our pension plans in fiscal 2018. the exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors, including minimum funding requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                the risks of participating in multi-employer plans are different from single-employer plans. the net pension cost of the multi-employer plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. assets contributed to such plans are not segregated or otherwise restricted to provide benefits only to our employees. the future cost of these plans is dependent on a number of factors including the funded status of the plans and the ability of the other participating companies to meet ongoing funding obligations.                                                                                                                                                                the sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time with the remaining assumptions held constant. economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and that the effect of changes in assumptions are not necessarily linear.

federal income tax includes an estimate for taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries expected to be taxable upon remittance to the united states, except for earnings considered to be indefinitely invested in the foreign subsidiary.   changes in projected future earnings could affect the recorded valuation allowances in the future.                                                                                                              to the extent we prevail in matters for which unrecognized tax benefit liabilities have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our recorded unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. an unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and generally result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. a favorable tax settlement would generally be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution.
deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.              our calculations related to income taxes contain uncertainties due to judgment used to calculate tax liabilities in the application of complex tax regulations across the tax jurisdictions where we operate.
valuation allowances are recorded when it is likely a tax benefit will not be realized for a deferred tax asset.                                                                                                                           our analysis of unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties based on judgment used to apply the more likely than not recognition and measurement thresholds.
we record unrecognized tax benefit liabilities for known or anticipated tax issues based on our analysis of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
impairment of long-lived assets and definite life intangibles long-lived assets and definite life intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. examples include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use the asset, a change in its physical condition, or an unexpected change in financial performance. when evaluating long-lived assets and definite life intangibles for impairment, we compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated undiscounted future cash flows. an impairment is indicated if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset. for assets held for sale, we compare the carrying value of the disposal group to fair value. the impairment is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. we recorded impairment charges related to long-lived assets and definite life intangibles of $214 million, $45 million and $262 million, in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.                          our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to judgment in assumptions, including useful lives and intended use of assets, observable market valuations, forecasted sales, operating margins, growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows to determine fair value.   we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate the impairment of long-lived assets or definite life intangibles during the last three fiscal years. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate impairments or useful lives of long-lived assets or definite life intangibles. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated future cash flows, we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material.
we periodically conduct projects to strategically evaluate optimization of such items as network capacity, manufacturing efficiencies and business technology. additionally, we continue to evaluate our international operations and strategies. if we have a significant change in strategies, outlook, or a manner in which we plan to use these assets, we may be exposed to future impairments.

impairment of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets description: goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary. if it is determined, based on qualitative factors, the fair value of the reporting unit may be more likely than not less than its carrying amount or if significant changes to macro-economic factors related to the reporting unit have occurred that could materially impact fair value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. the quantitative test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. we can elect to forgo the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test.
in january 2017, the fasb issued updated guidance simplifying the accounting for goodwill impairment. the guidance removes step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which required a hypothetical purchase price allocation. a goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. we early adopted this guidance in the third quarter of fiscal 2017; however, the adoption did not have an impact to our fiscal 2017 goodwill impairment assessment. for further description of this new guidance, refer to part ii, item 8, notes to consolidated financial statements, note 2: changes in accounting principles.
for indefinite life intangible assets, a qualitative assessment can also be performed to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates it is more likely than not an intangible asset is impaired. similar to goodwill, we can also elect to forgo the qualitative test for indefinite life intangible assets and perform the quantitative test. upon performing the quantitative test, if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. we elected to forgo the qualitative assessment on our indefinite life intangible assets for the fiscal 2017 impairment test.
we have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets. however, we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets prior to the required annual assessment if, among other things, we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization.
judgments and uncertainties: we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of various valuation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flow analysis) and market approaches (ebitda multiples of comparable publicly-traded companies and precedent transactions). our primary technique is discounted cash flow analysis. these approaches use significant unobservable inputs, or level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy and requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates.
we include assumptions about sales, operating margins and growth rates which consider our budgets, business plans and economic projections, and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term business plan period. generally, we utilize normalized operating margin assumptions based on future expectations and operating margins historically realized in the reporting units' industries.
our prepared foods reporting unit, which is our prepared foods operating segment, had goodwill at september 30, 2017, totaling $3,678 million. we generally assumed operating margins in future years would be in our normalized range of 10% to 12%, as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in an exit transaction. had we assumed future operating margins consistent with those realized in the current fiscal year, we would have failed the quantitative step of the annual impairment test, which may have resulted in a material goodwill impairment loss. the current year prepared foods reporting unit results were not indicative of future market participant expectations in an exit transaction primarily due to unusual items in fiscal 2017 including $213 million of charges related to an acquisition, impairment of our san diego operation, impairment associated with the expected sale of a non-protein business, and restructuring and related charges. additionally, we are in the process of divesting three non-protein businesses and integrating advancepierre's prepared operations into the prepared foods reporting unit, as well as executing our financial fitness program which should collectively improve operating results in future periods. to pass the first step of the annual impairment test in fiscal 2017, the prepared foods reporting unit's projected operating margins, utilizing the discounted cash flow valuation technique, had to average 6.6% (breakeven). we exceeded the breakeven operating margin level for the first nine months of fiscal 2017, as well as each of the previous two fiscal years, and expect to well exceed it in fiscal 2018 and in future years.
the fair value of our indefinite life intangible assets is calculated principally using relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings valuation approaches, which uses significant unobservable inputs, or level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy, and is believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. under these valuation approaches, we are required to make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data.
our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions: we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill and intangible assets during the last three years.

during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, all of our material reporting units that underwent a quantitative test passed the goodwill impairment analysis. in fiscal 2015, we recorded a $23 million full impairment of an immaterial reporting unit's goodwill.
some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets are outside the control of management, including interest rates, cost of capital, tax rates, market ebitda comparables and credit ratings. while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite life intangibles, it is possible a material change could occur. if our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value, it could result in additional material impairments of our goodwill.
all of our material reporting units' estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20% at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination. consequently, we do not currently consider any of our material reporting units at significant risk of impairment.
the discount rate used in our annual goodwill impairment test increased to 6.7% in fiscal 2017 from 6.2% in fiscal 2016. discount rates continue to be low compared to historical levels. a 54% increase in the discount rate would have caused the carrying value of our prepared foods reporting unit, with $3,678 million of goodwill at september 30, 2017, to exceed its discounted cash flows' fair value.
our fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 indefinite life intangible assets impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge. all indefinite life intangible assets' estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20% at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination. consequently, we do not currently consider any of our material indefinite life intangible assets at significant risk of impairment.
the discount rate used in our annual indefinite life intangible assets impairment test was 7.9% in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. a 20% increase in the discount rate would have caused the carrying value of one intangible asset, which has a carrying value of $533 million, to exceed fair value.

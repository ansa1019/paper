item 1a.   risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.
our operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price our operating results have been in the past, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors, some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment. these factors include:
•   fluctuations in demand for our products and services, especially with respect to service providers and internet businesses, in part due to changes in the global economic environment
•   changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our customers' spending plans and associated revenue
•   our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and purchase commitments
•   price and product competition in the communications and networking industries, which can change rapidly due to technological innovation and different business models from various geographic regions
•   the overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitors and our customers
•   the introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products and our success in new and evolving markets, including in our newer product categories such as data center and collaboration and in emerging technologies, as well as the adoption of new standards
•   the transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offerings where revenue is recognized over time
•   variations in sales channels, product costs, mix of products sold, or mix of direct sales and indirect sales
•   the timing, size, and mix of orders from customers
•   manufacturing and customer lead times
14
•   fluctuations in our gross margins, and the factors that contribute to such fluctuations, as described below
•   the ability of our customers, channel partners, contract manufacturers and suppliers to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures, especially during a period of global credit market disruption or in the event of customer, channel partner, contract manufacturer or supplier financial problems
•   actual events, circumstances, outcomes, and amounts differing from judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in determining the values of certain assets (including the amounts of related valuation allowances), liabilities, and other items reflected in our consolidated financial statements
•   how well we execute on our strategy and operating plans and the impact of changes in our business model that could result in significant restructuring charges
•   our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions
•   benefits anticipated from our investments in engineering, sales, service, and marketing
•   changes in tax laws or accounting rules, or interpretations thereof as a consequence, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict, and, therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. any of the foregoing factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price.
our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large, as well as in specific segments and markets in which we operate, resulting in:
•   reduced demand for our products as a result of continued constraints on it-related capital spending by our customers, particularly service providers, and other customer markets as well
•   increased price competition for our products, not only from our competitors but also as a consequence of customers disposing of unutilized products
•   risk of excess and obsolete inventories
•   risk of supply constraints
•   risk of excess facilities and manufacturing capacity
•   higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue and higher interest expense the global macroeconomic environment has been challenging and inconsistent. instability in the global credit markets, the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy, the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world including as a result of the recent united kingdom "brexit" referendum to withdraw from the european union, the current economic challenges in china, including global economic ramifications of chinese economic difficulties, and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions. if global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, remain uncertain or deteriorate further, we may experience material impacts on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment. for example, emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in product orders during fiscal 2017 and certain prior periods.
in addition, reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the u.s. government could affect customers' perception of the products of it companies which design and manufacture products in the united states. trust and confidence in us as an it supplier is critical to the development and growth of our markets. impairment of that trust, or foreign regulatory actions taken in response
15
to reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the u.s. government, could affect the demand for our products from customers outside of the united states and could have an adverse effect on our operating results.
we have been investing and expect to continue to invest in key priority and growth areas as well as maintaining leadership in routing, switching and services, and if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect, our operating results may be harmed we expect to realign and dedicate resources into key priority and growth areas, such as security, iot, collaboration, next generation data center, cloud and software, while also focusing on maintaining leadership in routing, switching and services. however, the return on our investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments (including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect), or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected.
our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results as a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report, our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict, especially in light of a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment and related market uncertainty.
our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or decline as it did in fiscal 2017 on a year-over-year basis. our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods. we have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments, leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns. in addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period, nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs, because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred, as well as in potential additional inventory management-related costs. in addition, to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in periods in which our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter.
the timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter, primarily in the united states and in emerging countries. from time to time, we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue. the timing of such orders is difficult to predict, and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in revenue. as a result, our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue.
inventory management remains an area of focus. we have experienced longer than normal manufacturing lead times in the past which have caused some customers to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon receipt of the product, or to place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times. such multiple ordering (along with other factors) or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue and, as a result, could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively. in addition, our efforts to improve manufacturing lead-time performance may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog. a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quarter-to-quarter revenue and operating results. in addition, when facing component supply-related challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations, which in turn contribute to an increase in purchase commitments. increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations.
we plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels. these expenses and the impact of long-term commitments are relatively fixed in the short term. a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short-term business changes.
any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results.
we expect gross margin to vary over time, and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable our product gross margins declined in fiscal 2017 and in certain other prior periods, and could decline in future quarters due to adverse impacts from various factors, including:
•   changes in customer, geographic, or product mix, including mix of configurations within each product group
16
•   introduction of new products, including products with price-performance advantages, and new business models including the transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offerings
•   our ability to reduce production costs
•   entry into new markets or growth in lower margin markets, including markets with different pricing and cost structures, through acquisitions or internal development
•   sales discounts
•   increases in material, labor or other manufacturing-related costs, which could be significant especially during periods of supply constraints such as those impacting the market for memory components
•   excess inventory and inventory holding charges
•   obsolescence charges
•   changes in shipment volume
•   the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals
•   increased cost, loss of cost savings or dilution of savings due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if parts ordering does not correctly anticipate product demand or if the financial health of either contract manufacturers or suppliers deteriorates
•   lower than expected benefits from value engineering
•   increased price competition, including competitors from asia, especially from china
•   changes in distribution channels
•   increased warranty costs
•   increased amortization of purchased intangible assets, especially from acquisitions
•   how well we execute on our strategy and operating plans changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services, as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods.
sales to the service provider market are especially volatile, and weakness in orders from this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases, especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain products in our newer product categories such as data center, collaboration, and service provider video, in addition to longer sales cycles. product orders from the service provider market decreased in fiscal 2017, and at various times in the past we have experienced significant weakness in product orders from service providers. product orders from the service provider market could continue to decline and, as has been the case in the past, such weakness could persist over extended periods of time given fluctuating market conditions. sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures; the availability of funding; and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory, economic, and business conditions in the country of operations. weakness in orders from this industry, including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers (which may be more prevalent during a global economic downturn, or periods of economic, political or regulatory uncertainty), could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods. orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets. for example, in the past, many of our service provider customers have been materially and adversely affected by slowdowns in the general economy, by overcapacity, by changes in the service provider market, by regulatory developments, and by constraints on capital availability, resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion plans. these conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past, and some of these or other conditions in the service provider market could affect our business
17
and operating results in any future period. finally, service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles; require a broader range of services, including design services; demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks; often require acceptance provisions, which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition; and expect financing from vendors. all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers.
disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins if we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly, or if our distributors' financial condition or operations weaken, our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected.
a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners, and the remainder is sold through direct sales. our channel partners include systems integrators, service providers, other resellers, and distributors. systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation, technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition to network equipment sales. systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution, and a number of service providers are also systems integrators. distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators, service providers, and other resellers. we refer to sales through distributors as our two-tier system of sales to the end customer. revenue from distributors is generally recognized based on a sell-through method using information provided by them. these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. if sales through indirect channels increase, this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and, to a degree, the timing of orders from our customers.
historically, we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels. although variability to date has not been significant, there can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability.
some factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model, which could harm our sales and margins, including the following:
•   we compete with some of our channel partners, including through our direct sales, which may lead these channel partners to use other suppliers that do not directly sell their own products or otherwise compete with them
•   some of our channel partners may demand that we absorb a greater share of the risks that their customers may ask them to bear
•   some of our channel partners may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes and challenges in business conditions
•   revenue from indirect sales could suffer if our distributors' financial condition or operations weaken in addition, we depend on our channel partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. to the extent that they fail to do so, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. further, sales of our products outside of agreed territories can result in disruption to our distribution channels.
the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive, which could adversely affect our achievement of revenue growth the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies, and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages. these market factors represent a competitive threat to us. we compete with numerous vendors in each product category. the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase. also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product categories such as data center and collaboration and in key priority and growth areas. for example, as products related to network programmability, such as sdn products, become more prevalent, we expect to face increased competition from companies that develop networking products based on commoditized hardware, referred to as "white box" hardware, to the extent customers decide to purchase those product offerings instead of ours. in addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market.
as we continue to expand globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions. in particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from competitors in asia, especially from china, and we anticipate this will continue. for information regarding our competitors, see the section entitled "competition" contained in item 1. business of this report.
some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product area. barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly
18
formed. in addition, some of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do. as we expand into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and sales positions in those markets. we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products. companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and in our view this trend may increase.
for example, the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies, including computing, networking, storage, and software, that previously were segregated. due to several factors, including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors, asics offering advanced services, standards based protocols, cloud computing and virtualization, the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple, previously independent, technology segments. also, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them to provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center. as a result of all of these developments, we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies, including competition from entities that are among our long-term strategic alliance partners. companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us.
the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include:
•   the ability to sell successful business outcomes
•   the ability to provide a broad range of networking and communications products and services
•   product performance
•   price
•   the ability to introduce new products, including providing continuous new customer value and products with price-performance advantages
•   the ability to reduce production costs
•   the ability to provide value-added features such as security, reliability, and investment protection
•   conformance to standards
•   market presence
•   the ability to provide financing
•   disruptive technology shifts and new business models we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology. the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. as such, we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies. any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success.
our inventory management relating to our sales to our two-tier distribution channel is complex, and excess inventory may harm our gross margins we must manage our inventory relating to sales to our distributors effectively, because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations. our distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high, or delay orders in anticipation of new products. they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them, and in response to seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand. revenue to our distributors generally is recognized based on a sell-through method using information provided by them, and they are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling price, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. when facing component supply-related challenges, we have increased our efforts
19
in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations. if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory, which in turn could result in lower gross margins.
supply chain issues, including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers, or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increased our costs or caused a delay in our ability to fulfill orders, could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results, and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply, which could adversely affect our gross margins the fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facilities and that we are reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results:
•   any financial problems of either contract manufacturers or component suppliers could either limit supply or increase costs
•   reservation of manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturers by other companies, inside or outside of our industry, could either limit supply or increase costs
•   industry consolidation occurring within one or more component supplier markets, such as the semiconductor market, could either limit supply or increase costs a reduction or interruption in supply; a significant increase in the price of one or more components; a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers; a failure to appropriately cancel, reschedule, or adjust our requirements based on our business needs; or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships. furthermore, as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers, we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market. in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used, our gross margins could decrease. we have experienced longer than normal lead times in the past. although we have generally secured additional supply or taken other mitigation actions when significant disruptions have occurred, if similar situations occur in the future, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. see the risk factor above entitled "our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results."
our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers. we have experienced component shortages in the past, including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues, that have affected our operations. we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues, manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers, capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers including capacity or cost problems resulting from industry consolidation, or strong demand in the industry for those parts. growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels and manufacturing capacity, especially for labor-intensive components, components for which we purchase a substantial portion of the supply, or the re-ramping of manufacturing capacity for highly complex products. during periods of shortages or delays the price of components may increase, or the components may not be available at all, and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs. we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed. accordingly, our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed. our operating results would also be adversely affected if, anticipating greater demand than actually develops, we commit to the purchase of more components than we need, which is more likely to occur in a period of demand uncertainties such as we are currently experiencing. there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future. although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products, certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources, and a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively impact the availability of components from one or more of these sources, especially during times such as we have recently seen when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken during economic downturns. we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales.
we believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future:
•   new markets in which we participate may grow quickly, which may make it difficult to quickly obtain significant component capacity
20
•   as we acquire companies and new technologies, we may be dependent, at least initially, on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners
•   we face competition for certain components that are supply-constrained, from existing competitors, and companies in other markets manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for us. we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. during the normal course of business, in order to improve manufacturing lead-time performance and to help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements. in certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. when facing component supply-related challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations, which in turn contributes to an increase in purchase commitments. increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations. if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins. for additional information regarding our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers' changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, new product introductions, and evolving methods of building and operating networks. our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products. many of our strategic initiatives and investments we have made, and our architectural approach, are designed to enable the increased use of the network as the platform for automating, orchestrating, integrating, and delivering an ever-increasing array of it-based products and services. for example, in june 2017 we announced our catalyst 9000 series of switches which represent the initial foundation of our intent-based networking capabilities. other current initiatives include our focus on security; the market transition related to digital transformation and iot; the transition in cloud; and the move towards more programmable, flexible and virtual networks.
the process of developing new technology, including intent-based networking, more programmable, flexible and virtual networks, and technology related to other market transitions- such as security, digital transformation and iot, and cloud- is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed. we must commit significant resources, including the investments we have been making in our priorities to developing new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept. in particular, if our model of the evolution of networking does not emerge as we believe it will, or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will, or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful, many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value. for example, if we do not introduce products related to network programmability, such as software-defined-networking products, in a timely fashion, or if product offerings in this market that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, that differs from ours, such as, for example, networking products based on "white box" hardware, our business could be harmed. similarly, our business could be harmed if we fail to develop, or fail to develop in a timely fashion, offerings to address other transitions, or if the offerings addressing these other transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, different from ours. in addition, our business could be adversely affected in periods surrounding our new product introductions if customers delay purchasing decisions to qualify or otherwise evaluate the new product offerings.
our strategy is to lead our customers in their digital transition with solutions that deliver greater agility, productivity, security and other advanced network capabilities, and that intelligently connect nearly everything that can be connected. over the last few years, we have been transforming our business to move from selling individual products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions, and we are seeking to meet the evolving needs of customers which include offering our products and solutions in the manner in which customers wish to consume them. as a part of this transformation, we continue to make changes to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology, including changes in our business models with customers. if our strategy for addressing our customer needs, or the architectures and solutions we develop do not meet those needs, or the changes we are making in how we are organized and how we build and deliver or technology is incorrect or ineffective, our business could be harmed.
furthermore, we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing, technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion, or a lack of appropriate resources. this could result in competitors, some of which may also be our strategic alliance partners, providing those solutions before we do and loss of market
21
share, revenue, and earnings. in addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market. the success of new products depends on several factors, including proper new product definition, component costs, timely completion and introduction of these products, differentiation of new products from those of our competitors, and market acceptance of these products. there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities, develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner, or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. the products and technologies in our other product categories and key priority and growth areas may not prove to have the market success we anticipate, and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new products.
changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses, asset impairments and workforce reductions or restructurings in response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign our resources and to consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses. any resource realignment, or decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses, may result in the recording of special charges, such as inventory and technology-related write-offs, workforce reduction or restructuring costs, charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities, or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products. our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets, including purchased intangible assets, could change as a result of such assessments and decisions. although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed, our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and suppliers. further, our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions. additionally, we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings.
in august 2016, we announced a restructuring plan under which we began taking action in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. in may 2017, we extended the restructuring plan to include additional employees. the implementation of this restructuring plan may be disruptive to our business, and following completion of the restructuring plan our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of the plan. our restructuring activities, including any related charges and the impact of the related headcount restructurings, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
over the long term we intend to invest in engineering, sales, service and marketing activities, and these investments may achieve delayed, or lower than expected, benefits which could harm our operating results while we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses, over the long term, we also intend to invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering, sales, service and marketing functions as we realign and dedicate resources on key priority and growth areas, such as security, iot, collaboration, next generation data center, cloud, and software, and we also intend to focus on maintaining leadership in routing, switching and services. we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected.
our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and internet-based systems a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth and evolution of the internet, including the continued development of the internet and the anticipated market transitions, and on the deployment of our products by customers who depend on such continued growth and evolution. to the extent that an economic slowdown or uncertainty and related reduction in capital spending adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure, including spending or investment related to anticipated market transitions, we could experience material harm to our business, operating results, and financial condition.
because of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related to matters such as cost-effectiveness and security, we believe that there could be performance problems with internet communications in the future, which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility. because we are a large supplier of networking products, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be materially adversely affected, regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our own products. such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effects on our business.
22
we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results our growth depends upon market growth, our ability to enhance our existing products, and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis. we intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies, product lines, technologies, and personnel. acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:
•   difficulties in integrating the operations, systems, technologies, products, and personnel of the acquired companies, particularly companies with large and widespread operations and/or complex products
•   diversion of management's attention from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from acquisitions
•   potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process research and development intangibles
•   difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions
•   initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners
•   insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions
•   the potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the companies we acquire following and continuing after announcement of acquisition plans acquisitions may also cause us to:
•   issue common stock that would dilute our current shareholders' percentage ownership
•   use a substantial portion of our cash resources, or incur debt
•   significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition
•   assume liabilities
•   record goodwill and intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges
•   incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets
•   incur tax expenses related to the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany r&amp;d cost sharing arrangement and legal structure
•   incur large and immediate write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses
•   become subject to intellectual property or other litigation mergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control, and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results. prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes, from successful introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so. even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products.
from time to time, we have made acquisitions that resulted in charges in an individual quarter. these charges may occur in any particular quarter, resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings. in addition, our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions. risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions. see the risk factors above, including the risk factor entitled "we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to
23
existing products, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers' changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer" for additional information.
entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations as we focus on new market opportunities and key priority and growth areas, we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies. several of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do. additionally, as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments, they may require greater levels of service, support, and financing than we have provided in the past, especially in emerging countries. demand for these types of service, support, or financing contracts may increase in the future. there can be no assurance that we can provide products, service, support, and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities.
further, provision of greater levels of services, support and financing by us may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition. in addition, entry into other markets has subjected and will subject us to additional risks, particularly to those markets, including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence. for example, as we add direct selling capabilities globally to meet changing customer demands, we will face increased legal and regulatory requirements.
industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years. we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. for example, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them with the ability to provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center. companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. furthermore, particularly in the service provider market, rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers, with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants.
product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue, gross margins, and net income we produce highly complex products that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software. software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations. there can be no assurance that our pre-shipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects, either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments, which might interfere with customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities, or affect gross margins. from time to time, we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped. there can be no assurance that such remediation, depending on the product involved, would not have a material impact. an inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our reputation, inventory costs, or product reengineering expenses, any of which could have a material impact on our revenue, margins, and net income. for example, in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 we recorded a charge to product cost of sales of $125 million related to the expected remediation costs for anticipated failures in future periods of a widely-used component sourced from a third party which is included in several of our products, and in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we recorded a pre-tax charge of $655 million related to the expected remediation costs for certain products sold in prior fiscal years containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010.
due to the global nature of our operations, political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world. as such, our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into emerging countries. we also depend on non-u.s. operations of our contract manufacturers, component suppliers and distribution partners. emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in orders during fiscal 2017 and certain prior periods. we continue to assess the sustainability of any improvements in these countries and there can be no assurance that our investments in these countries will be successful. our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of political, economic or other factors relating to our operations inside and outside the united states, including impacts from global central bank monetary policy; issues related to the political relationship between the united states and other countries that can affect the willingness of customers in those countries to purchase products from companies headquartered in the united states; and the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect
24
on our operating results and financial condition, including, among others, the following:
•   foreign currency exchange rates
•   political or social unrest
•   economic instability or weakness or natural disasters in a specific country or region, including the current economic challenges in china and global economic ramifications of chinese economic difficulties; instability as a result of brexit; environmental and trade protection measures and other legal and regulatory requirements, some of which may affect our ability to import our products, to export our products from, or sell our products in various countries
•   political considerations that affect service provider and government spending patterns
•   health or similar issues, such as a pandemic or epidemic
•   difficulties in staffing and managing international operations
•   adverse tax consequences, including imposition of withholding or other taxes on our global operations we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets, which could result in material losses most of our sales are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 days in the united states and, because of local customs or conditions, longer in some markets outside the united states. we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements, seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay, and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts. beyond our open credit arrangements, we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements. we expect demand for customer financing to continue, and recently we have been experiencing an increase in this demand as the credit markets have been impacted by the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment, including increased demand from customers in certain emerging countries.
we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business, particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects. our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services.
our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above may increase if our customers are adversely affected by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty. although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk, including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas, there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks.
in the past, there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements, particularly among internet businesses and service providers, causing us to incur economic or financial losses. there can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred. although these losses have not been material to date, future losses, if incurred, could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. a portion of our sales is derived through our distributors. these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such business terms. however, distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other resellers and end-user customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk, because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resources to meet payment obligations. additionally, to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing, those customers' ability to pay could be adversely impacted, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates; impairment of our investments could harm our earnings we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. these securities are generally classified as available-for-sale and, consequently, are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. our portfolio includes fixed income securities and equity investments in publicly traded companies, the values of which are subject to market price volatility to the extent unhedged. if such investments suffer market price declines, as we experienced with some of our investments in the past, we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis when the decline is judged to be other than temporary. for information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and
25
interest rates, refer to the section titled "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk." our investments in private companies are subject to risk of loss of investment capital. these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. we could lose our entire investment in these companies.
we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. historically, our primary exposures have related to nondollar-denominated sales in japan, canada, and australia and certain nondollar-denominated operating expenses and service cost of sales in europe, latin america, and asia, where we sell primarily in u.s. dollars. additionally, we have exposures to emerging market currencies, which can have extreme currency volatility. an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies.
currently, we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to reduce the short-term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency receivables, investments, and payables. in addition, we periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows. our attempts to hedge against these risks may result in an adverse impact on our net income.
our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce we generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending, there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that our rights will, in fact, provide competitive advantages to us. furthermore, many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards, which are usable by all market entrants. in addition, there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. in addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states. the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states. although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete, if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features (including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights) in a market, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense, time, and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful.
we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the united states. because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field, the secrecy of some pending patents, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others. the asserted claims and/or initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, or customers, alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products. regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, or require us to develop a non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements. where claims are made by customers, resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships. there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all, or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers. furthermore, because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable, it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts. if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. for additional information regarding our indemnification obligations, see note 12(g) to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report.
our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions, as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against
26
infringement risks. further, in the past, third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.
we rely on the availability of third-party licenses many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products. there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. moreover, the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products.
our operating results may be adversely affected and damage to our reputation may occur due to production and sale of counterfeit versions of our products as is the case with leading products around the world, our products are subject to efforts by third parties to produce counterfeit versions of our products. while we work diligently with law enforcement authorities in various countries to block the manufacture of counterfeit goods and to interdict their sale, and to detect counterfeit products in customer networks, and have succeeded in prosecuting counterfeiters and their distributors, resulting in fines, imprisonment and restitution to us, there can be no guarantee that such efforts will succeed. while counterfeiters often aim their sales at customers who might not have otherwise purchased our products due to lack of verifiability of origin and service, such counterfeit sales, to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sales, could adversely affect our operating results.
our operating results and future prospects could be materially harmed by uncertainties of regulation of the internet currently, few laws or regulations apply directly to access or commerce on the internet. we could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the internet and internet commerce in any country where we operate. such regulations could include matters such as voice over the internet or using ip, encryption technology, sales or other taxes on internet product or service sales, and access charges for internet service providers. the adoption of regulation of the internet and internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and, at the same time, increase the cost of selling our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
changes in telecommunications regulation and tariffs could harm our prospects and future sales changes in telecommunications requirements, or regulatory requirements in other industries in which we operate, in the united states or other countries could affect the sales of our products. in particular, we believe that there may be future changes in u.s. telecommunications regulations that could slow the expansion of the service providers' network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, including "net neutrality" rules to the extent they impact decisions on investment in network infrastructure.
future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our products for certain classes of customers. additionally, in the united states, our products must comply with various requirements and regulations of the federal communications commission and other regulatory authorities. in countries outside of the united states, our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications and other industry authorities. changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, sales, and marketing personnel. competition for these personnel is intense, especially in the silicon valley area of northern california. stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us. volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive awards, or changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, resulting from the management of share dilution and share-based compensation expense or otherwise, may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees. as a result of one or more of these factors, we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the united states, which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk. the loss of services of any of our key personnel; the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future; or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly engineering and sales personnel, could make it difficult to meet key objectives, such as timely and effective product introductions. in addition, companies in our industry whose employees accept
27
positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices. we have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future.
adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm our operating results or financial condition we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations. moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. for example, brazilian authorities have investigated our brazilian subsidiary and certain of its former employees, as well as a brazilian importer of our products, and its affiliates and employees, relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer. brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the brazilian importer for import taxes, interest, and penalties. the asserted claims by brazilian federal tax authorities which remain are for calendar years 2003 through 2007, and the asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state of sao paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007. the total asserted claims by brazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregate to $258 million for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes, $1.5 billion for interest, and $1.2 billion for various penalties, all determined using an exchange rate as of july 29, 2017. we have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the asserted claims against our brazilian subsidiary are without merit, and we are defending the claims vigorously. while we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability, due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer, we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our brazilian subsidiary and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any. we do not expect a final judicial determination for several years. an unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition. for additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved, see item 3, "legal proceedings," contained in part i of this report.
changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany r&d cost sharing arrangement and legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including possible changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules. significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd), an international association comprised of 35 countries, including the united states, has recently made changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. there can be no assurance that these changes, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates. our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes, floods, and other natural catastrophic events our corporate headquarters, including certain of our research and development operations are located in the silicon valley area of northern california, a region known for seismic activity. additionally, a certain number of our facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past. also certain of our suppliers and logistics centers are located in regions that have been or may be affected by earthquake, tsunami and flooding activity which in the past has disrupted, and in the future could disrupt, the flow of components and delivery of products. a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, a hurricane, volcano, or a flood, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
28
man-made problems such as cyber-attacks, data protection breaches, computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations, harm our operating results and damage our reputation, and cyber-attacks or data protection breaches on our customers' networks, or in cloud-based services provided by or enabled by us, could result in liability for us, damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business despite our implementation of network security measures, the products and services we sell to customers, and our servers, data centers and the cloud-based solutions on which our data, and data of our customers, suppliers and business partners are stored, are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, data protection breaches, computer viruses, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering or human error. any such event could compromise our networks or those of our customers, and the information stored on our networks or those of our customers could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen, which could subject us to liability to our customers, suppliers, business partners and others, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and may cause damage to our reputation. efforts to limit the ability of malicious third parties to disrupt the operations of the internet or undermine our own security efforts may be costly to implement and meet with resistance, and may not be successful. breaches of network security in our customers' networks, or in cloud-based services provided by or enabled by us, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services, could result in liability for us, damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business.
in addition, the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause further disruptions to the economies of the united states and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. likewise, events such as loss of infrastructure and utilities services such as energy, transportation, or telecommunications could have similar negative impacts. to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances, we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development we have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with which we work to offer complementary products and services and in the past have established a joint venture to market services associated with our cisco unified computing system products. these arrangements are generally limited to specific projects, the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards. there can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefits from these strategic alliances or from the joint venture. if successful, these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth. however, alliances carry an element of risk because, in most cases, we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and, at the same time, cooperate with that company in other business areas. also, if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected, we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties. joint ventures can be difficult to manage, given the potentially different interests of joint venture partners.
our stock price may be volatile historically, our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility, particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us. furthermore, speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of operations, business, security of our products, or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price. in addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies, in particular, and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. these factors, as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions, or any difficulties associated with such transactions, by us or our current or potential competitors, may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future. additionally, volatility, lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, virtually all of whom are compensated, in part, based on the performance of our stock price.
29
there can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be adversely affected by our incurrence of debt as of the end of fiscal 2017, we have senior unsecured notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of $30.5 billion that mature at specific dates from calendar year 2018 through 2040. we have also established a commercial paper program under which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $10.0 billion, and we had $3.2 billion commercial paper notes outstanding under this program as of july 29, 2017. the outstanding senior unsecured notes bear fixed-rate interest payable semiannually, except $2.9 billion of the notes which bears interest at a floating rate payable quarterly. the fair value of the long-term debt is subject to market interest rate volatility. the instruments governing the senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants applicable to us and our wholly-owned subsidiaries that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. in addition, we will be required to have available in the united states sufficient cash to service the interest on our debt and repay all of our notes on maturity. there can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources, including cash currently held offshore. further, we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. in addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the terms upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program or future debt issuances.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k, including this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, contains forward-looking statements regarding future events and our future results that are subject to the safe harbors created under the securities act of 1933 (the "securities act") and the securities exchange act of 1934 (the "exchange act"). all statements other than statements of historical facts are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements. these statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industries in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. words such as "expects," "anticipates," "targets," "goals," "projects," "intends," "plans," "believes," "momentum," "seeks," "estimates," "continues," "endeavors," "strives," "may," variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. in addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict, including those under "part i, item 1a. risk factors," and elsewhere herein. therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason.

(1) during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our service provider video connected devices business ("sp video cpe business"). as a result, revenue from this portion of the service provider video product category will not recur in future periods. the year ended july 30, 2016 included sp video cpe business revenue of $504 million.
35
fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016-financial performance in fiscal 2017 we delivered solid profitability and strong operating cash flows. we remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we believe that we have made continued progress on our strategic priorities. we continue to operate in a challenging and highly competitive environment, which has impacted, in particular, our ngn routing and switching areas. we saw weakness in the service provider customer market and we expect ongoing uncertainty in that area. in addition, we continued to see weakness in emerging countries in the aggregate. we experienced solid revenue growth in security and wireless, and we continued to make progress in the transition of our business model to increased software and subscriptions which is part of our strategy. while the overall environment remains uncertain, we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas to drive profitable growth over the long term.
total revenue decreased by 3% compared with fiscal 2016. within total revenue, product revenue decreased 4% while service revenue increased by 3%. in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we completed the sale of our sp video cpe business. total company revenue for fiscal 2017 decreased 2% not including revenue from sp video cpe products for fiscal 2016. additionally, fiscal 2017 had 52 weeks, compared with 53 weeks in fiscal 2016, thus our results for fiscal 2017 reflect one less week compared with fiscal 2016. we estimate that the additional revenue associated with the extra week was approximately $265 million. total gross margin increased by 0.1 percentage points. as a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, decreased by 0.1 percentage points. operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 0.8 percentage points, driven primarily by an increase in restructuring and other charges related to the restructuring action announced in august 2016. diluted earnings per share decreased by 10%, driven by an 11% decrease in net income. net income was impacted by a higher effective tax rate, as compared with fiscal 2016, primarily due to the recognition of $448 million of net benefits to the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2016. these benefits were comprised of a settlement with the irs of outstanding items related to the audit of our federal income tax returns covering the period from fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2010 and the permanent reinstatement of the u.s. federal r&d tax credit.
in terms of our geographic segments, revenue from the americas decreased $1.0 billion, driven in large part by lower product revenue in the unites states. emea revenue decreased by $0.3 billion, led by a product revenue decline in the united kingdom. revenue in our apjc segment increased by $0.1 billion, led by service revenue growth in this segment. we saw revenue declines in many emerging countries across the world during fiscal 2017. the "bricm" countries experienced a product revenue decline of 7% in the aggregate, driven by declines in the emerging countries of mexico, china and brazil of 28%, 12% and 7%, respectively, partially offset by increased product revenue in russia and india of 20% and 11%, respectively.
from a customer market standpoint, we experienced product revenue declines in the service provider and the public sector markets and, to a lesser extent, in the commercial market. product revenue in the enterprise market was flat. the decline in the service provider market was driven in part by the sale of the sp video cpe business as well as ongoing weakness in the service provider market.
from a product category perspective, total company product revenue decreased 4%. this decrease was led by product revenue decreases in switching and ngn routing of 5% and 4%, respectively. the decline in sales of our switching products was primarily due to lower sales of switches used in campus environments, which comprise the majority of our switching portfolio. we believe the decline in sales of switching products used in campus environments was driven both by uncertainty in the macro environment, which led to a slowdown in customer spending, as well as by a highly competitive landscape. product revenue from service provider video, data center and collaboration decreased by 45%, 4% and 2%, respectively. partially offsetting these decreases was product revenue growth in security and wireless, which grew by 9% and 5%, respectively.
36
fourth quarter snapshot for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, as compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, total revenue decreased by 4%. within the total revenue, product revenue decreased 5% while service revenue increased by 1%. with regard to our geographic segment performance, on a year-over-year basis, revenue in the americas and emea each decreased by 6%, while apjc had revenue growth of 6%. from a product category perspective, total product revenue decrease was driven by revenue decreases from switching and ngn routing products, with each decreasing 9% year over year. total gross margin decreased by 0.9 percentage points. as a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses collectively decreased by 0.7 percentage points. operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 1.1 percentage points. diluted earnings per share decreased by 14% from the prior year, primarily as a result of a 14% decrease in net income.
strategy and priorities as our customers add billions of new connections to their enterprises, we believe the network is becoming more critical than ever. we believe that our customers are looking for intelligent networks that provide meaningful business value through automation, security, and analytics. our vision is to deliver a highly secure, intelligent, platform for digital businesses. our strategic priorities include accelerating our pace of innovation, increasing the value of the network, and delivering technology the way our customers want to consume it.

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. note 2 to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met:
•   persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. contracts, internet commerce agreements, and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement.
•   delivery has occurred. shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery. for software, delivery is considered to have occurred upon unrestricted license access and license term commencement, when applicable.
•   the fee is fixed or determinable. we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.
•   collectibility is reasonably assured. we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer's payment history.
in instances where final acceptance of the product, system, or solution is specified by the customer, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. when a sale involves multiple deliverables, such as sales of products that include services, the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting, and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price. revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met. for hosting arrangements, we recognize revenue ratably over the hosting period, while usage revenue is recognized based on utilization. software subscription revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription term upon delivery of the first product and commencement of the term.
the amount of revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple deliverables and, if so, our valuation of the units of accounting. our multiple element arrangements may contain only deliverables within the scope of accounting standards codification (asc) 605, revenue recognition, deliverables within the scope of asc 985-605, software-revenue recognition, or a combination of both. according to the accounting guidance prescribed in asc 605, we use vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (vsoe) for each of those units, when available. we determine vsoe based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately. in determining vsoe, we require that a substantial majority of the historical standalone transactions have the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range, generally evidenced by approximately 80% of such historical standalone transactions falling within plus or minus 15% of the median rates. when vsoe does not exist, we apply the selling price hierarchy to applicable multiple-deliverable arrangements. under the selling price hierarchy, third-party evidence of selling price (tpe) will be considered if vsoe does not exist, and estimated selling price (esp) will be used if neither vsoe nor tpe is available. generally, we are not able to determine tpe because our go-to-market strategy differs from that of others in our markets, and the extent of our proprietary technology varies among comparable products or services from those of our peers. in determining esp, we apply significant judgment as we weigh a variety of factors, based on the characteristics of the deliverable. we typically arrive at an esp for a product or service that is not sold separately by considering company-specific factors such as geographies, competitive landscape, internal costs, profitability objectives, pricing practices used to establish bundled pricing, and existing portfolio pricing and discounting.
as our business and offerings evolve over time, our pricing practices may be required to be modified accordingly, which could result in changes in selling prices, including both vsoe and esp, in subsequent periods. there were no material impacts during fiscal 2017, nor do we currently expect a material impact in the next 12 months on our revenue recognition due to any changes in our vsoe, tpe, or esp.
we make sales to distributors which we refer to as two-tier sales to the end customer. revenue from two-tier distributors is recognized based on a sell-through method using point-of-sale information provided by these distributors. distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other incentive programs, and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs. if actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.

allowances for receivables and sales returns the allowances for receivables were as follows (in millions, except percentages):
july 29, 2017             july 30, 2016
allowance for doubtful accounts                              $211                      $249
percentage of gross accounts receivable                       3.9   %                   4.1   %
allowance for credit loss-lease receivables                  $162                      $230
percentage of gross lease receivables (1)                     5.5   %                   6.6   %
allowance for credit loss-loan receivables                   $103                       $97
percentage of gross loan receivables                          2.3   %                   2.8   %
(1) calculated as allowance for credit loss on lease receivables as a percentage of gross lease receivables and residual value before unearned income.
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts. we regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience, credit quality and age of the receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer's ability to pay as well as historical and expected default frequency rates, which are published by major third-party credit-rating agencies and are updated on a quarterly basis. we also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts. if a major customer's creditworthiness deteriorates, if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, or if other circumstances arise, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, and additional allowances could be required, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.
the allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer accounts. we regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowances determined either on an individual or a collective basis. when evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis, we consider historical experience, credit quality and age of receivable balances, and economic conditions that may affect a customer's ability to pay. when evaluating financing receivables on a collective basis, we use expected default frequency rates published by a major third-party credit-rating agency as well as our own historical loss rate in the event of default, while also systematically giving effect to economic conditions, concentration of risk and correlation. determining expected default frequency rates and loss factors associated with internal credit risk ratings, as well as assessing factors such as economic conditions, concentration of risk, and correlation, are complex and subjective. our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future, which could adversely affect our operating results. both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible.
a reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates. the reserve for future sales returns as of july 29, 2017 and july 30, 2016 was $122 million and $126 million, respectively, and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue. if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established, our revenue could be adversely affected.
inventory valuation and liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories, determined primarily by future demand forecasts. inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market, based upon assumptions about future demand, and are charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of our cost of sales. at the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.
we record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. as of july 29, 2017, the liability for these purchase commitments was $162 million, compared with $159 million as of july 30, 2016, and was included in other current liabilities.
our provision for inventory was $74 million, $65 million, and $54 million in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. the provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was $124 million, $134 million, and $102 million in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, we could be required to increase our inventory write-downs, and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, and accordingly our profitability, could be adversely affected. we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments.
39
inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence, particularly in light of current macroeconomic uncertainties and conditions and the resulting potential for changes in future demand forecast.
loss contingencies and product warranties we are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. we consider the likelihood of impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. we regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required.
third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the united states. if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
in fiscal 2014, we recorded a charge to product cost of sales of $655 million resulting from failures related to products containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010. we perform regular assessments of the sufficiency of this liability and reduced the amount by $74 million and $164 million in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively based on updated analyses. during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we further reduced the liability by $141 million to reflect lower than expected defects, actual usage history, and estimated lower future remediation costs as more of the impacted products age and near the end of the support period covered by the remediation program. in addition, during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded a $125 million charge to product cost of sales related to the expected remediation costs for anticipated failures in future periods of a widely-used component sourced from a third party which is included in several of our products. the liabilities related to the supplier component remediation matters as of july 29, 2017 and july 30, 2016 was $174 million and $276 million, respectively.
estimating these liabilities is complex and subjective, and if we experience changes in a number of underlying assumptions and estimates such as a change in claims compared with our expectations, or if the cost of servicing these claims is different than expected, our estimated liabilities for these matters may be impacted.
our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years, and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty. we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs, technical support labor costs, and associated overhead. material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment. technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period. overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities.
if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected, our profitability could be adversely affected.
fair value measurements our fixed income and publicly traded equity securities, collectively, are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at a fair value of $58.8 billion as of july 29, 2017, compared with $58.1 billion as of july 30, 2016. our fixed income investment portfolio, as of july 29, 2017, consisted primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
as described more fully in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, a valuation hierarchy is based on the level of independent, objective evidence available regarding the value of the investments. it encompasses three classes of investments: level 1 consists of securities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical securities; level 2 consists of securities for which observable inputs other than level 1 inputs are used, such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets and model-derived valuations for which the variables are derived from, or corroborated by, observable market data; and level 3 consists of securities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value.
40
our level 2 securities are valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. we use inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data, which are obtained from independent pricing vendors, quoted market prices, or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities. we use such pricing data as the primary input, to which we have not made any material adjustments during fiscal 2017 and 2016, to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio. we are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates.
the inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness, may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information, and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to its estimate of fair value. the assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective. however, given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio, and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets, we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions affected by levels of subjectivity and judgment was material to the valuation of the investment portfolio as of july 29, 2017. level 3 assets do not represent a significant portion of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of july 29, 2017 and july 30, 2016.
other-than-temporary impairments we recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our fixed income or publicly traded equity securities below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary. the ultimate value realized on these securities, to the extent unhedged, is subject to market price volatility until they are sold.
if the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost, we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary. an impairment is considered other than temporary if (i) we have the intent to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis, or (iii) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security. if an impairment is considered other than temporary based on (i) or (ii) described in the prior sentence, the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings. if an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition (iii), the amount representing credit loss, defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security, will be recognized in earnings, and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income (oci). in estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected, we consider all available information, including past events, current conditions, the remaining payment terms of the security, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults, and the value of underlying collateral.
for publicly traded equity securities, we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
we also have investments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages. as of july 29, 2017, our investments in privately held companies were $983 million, compared with $1,003 million as of july 30, 2016, and were included in other assets. we monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment, and we make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required, based primarily on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies. these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize.
goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairments our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. the assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets.
the goodwill recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as of july 29, 2017 and july 30, 2016 was $29.8 billion and $26.6 billion, respectively. the increase in goodwill during fiscal 2017 was due in large part to our acquisition of appdynamics. in response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015. for the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2017, the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was $46.8 billion for the americas, $25.1 billion for emea, and $20.9 billion for apjc.
41
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit.
the fair value of acquired technology and patents, as well as acquired technology under development, is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. the discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate. we consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry, and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets.
we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. we review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. if the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. they can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. our impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were $47 million, $74 million, and $175 million during fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, r&d tax credits, domestic manufacturing deductions, tax audit settlements, nondeductible compensation, international realignments, and transfer pricing adjustments. our effective tax rate was 21.8%, 16.9%, and 19.8% in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.
significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany r&d cost-sharing arrangement and legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including possible changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules. significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd), an international association comprised of 35 countries, including the united states, has recently made changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. there can be no assurance that these changes, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates. our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service (irs) and other tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016
total revenue decreased by 3%. total company revenue not including sp video cpe products decreased 2%. product revenue decreased by 4% while service revenue increased by 3%. fiscal 2017 had 52 weeks, compared with 53 weeks in fiscal 2016, thus our results for fiscal 2017 reflect one less extra week. we estimate that the additional revenue associated with the extra week was approximately $265 million, $200 million of which was from our services subscriptions, and $65 million from our saas offerings such as webex, and a small amount from product distribution. our total revenue declined in the americas and emea geographic segments, while revenue grew in our apjc geographic segment. the emerging countries of bricm, in the aggregate, experienced a 7% product revenue decline, with revenue declines in mexico, china, and brazil partially offset by increases in the other two bricm countries.
in addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a reduced it spending environment and reductions in spending by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple-element arrangements; the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors. in addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment. as has been the case in certain emerging countries from time to time, customers require greater levels of financing arrangements, service, and support, and these activities may occur in future periods, which may also impact the timing of the recognition of revenue.

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015
total revenue was flat. total company revenue not including sp video cpe products increased 3%. product revenue decreased by 1% in total, but increased by 2% for product revenue not including sp video cpe products. service revenue increased by 5%. fiscal 2016 had 53 weeks, compared with 52 weeks in fiscal 2015, thus our results for fiscal 2016 reflect an extra week, the impact of which is discussed above. our total revenue grew in our apjc geographic segment, while revenue declined in the americas and emea geographic segments. the emerging countries of bricm, in the aggregate, experienced 3% product revenue growth, with growth in china, india and mexico, partially offset by decreases in the other two bricm countries. our revenue in fiscal 2016 was adversely affected by the depreciation of certain currencies relative to the u.s. dollar and especially currencies in certain emerging countries, although the indirect effects are difficult to measure.

during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we completed the sale of our sp video cpe business. as a result, revenue from this portion of the service provider video product category will not recur in future periods. sp video cpe business revenue was $504 million and $1,846 million for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.
americas fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016
the 5% decrease in product revenue in the americas segment was driven by declines in the service provider, public sector and commercial markets. product revenue in the enterprise market was flat. the product revenue decrease in the service provider market was driven in large part by the absence of product sales related to our sp video cpe business in fiscal 2017. we had $378 million in product sales related to our sp video cpe business in fiscal 2016 in this segment. the product revenue decline in the public sector market was due primarily to lower sales to state and local governments and to the u.s. federal government. from a country perspective, product revenue decreased by 5% in the united states, 28% in mexico and 7% in brazil, partially offset by an increase of 2% in canada.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015
the decrease in product revenue for the americas segment was driven by a decline of $1,146 million in product sales related to our sp video cpe business. product revenue not including sp video cpe products increased for the americas segment. from a customer markets perspective, the decrease in product revenue in the americas segment of 3% was led by a significant decline in the service provider market driven by the sale of the sp video cpe business. we experienced product revenue growth in the commercial, public sector and enterprise markets. the product revenue growth in the public sector market was due primarily to higher sales to state and local governments, partially offset by lower sales to the u.s. federal government. from a country perspective, product revenue decreased by 34% in brazil and 24% in canada partially offset by a slight increase in the united states and an increase of 3% in mexico.
44
emea fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016
product revenue in the emea segment decreased by 3%, driven by a decline in the service provider market and, to a lesser extent, declines in the public sector and enterprise markets. product revenue in the commercial market was flat. the product revenue decrease in the service provider market was driven in part by the absence of product sales related to our sp video cpe business in fiscal 2017. we had $108 million in product sales related to our sp video cpe business in fiscal 2016 in this segment. product revenue from emerging countries within emea and product revenue for the remainder of the emea segment each decreased by 3%.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015
the decrease in product revenue of 2%, or $200 million, for the emea segment was driven by a decline of $164 million in product sales related to our sp video cpe business. from a customer market perspective, the decrease was driven by product revenue declines in the service provider, public sector and enterprise markets, partially offset by product revenue growth in the commercial market. the decline in sales to the service provider market was due primarily to the sale of the sp video cpe business. product revenue from emerging countries within emea decreased by 11%, led by a decline in russia of 31%. product revenue for the remainder of the emea segment, which primarily consists of countries in western europe, increased by 1%.
apjc fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016
product revenue in the apjc segment decreased by 1%. the product revenue decrease was led by declines in the service provider and public sector markets, partially offset by product revenue growth in the commercial market. product revenue in the enterprise market was flat. from a country perspective, product revenue decreased by 12% in china, driven by a decrease in sales of service provider video software and solutions products, while product revenue increased by 11% in india, 9% in australia and 2% in japan. product sales for this geographic segment were adversely impacted by an $18 million decrease in product sales related to the absence of our sp video cpe business.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015
the increase in product revenue in the apjc segment of 5% was led by solid growth in the service provider market and, to a lesser extent, growth in the enterprise, public sector and commercial markets. from a country perspective, product revenue increased by 22% in china, driven by an increase in sales of service provider video software and solutions products, and 18% in india, partially offset by product revenue decreases of 7% in japan and 5% in australia. product revenue for this geographic segment was adversely impacted by a $32 million decrease in product revenue related to the sale of our sp video cpe business.

(1) during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we completed the sale of the sp video cpe business. as a result, fiscal 2016 includes only four months of product revenue from sp video cpe business. sp video cpe business revenue was $504 million and $1,846 million for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.
certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation.
switching fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016
the decrease in revenue in our switching product category of 5%, or $751 million, was driven primarily by a decrease in sales of switching products used in campus environments, which comprise the majority of our switching portfolio. we believe this was driven both by the uncertainty in the macro environment which led to a slowdown in customer spending, as well as by a highly competitive landscape. these impacts were partially offset by an increase in sales of our aci portfolio which is included in our data center switching portfolio.
in terms of subcategories, the decrease in revenue from our modular switches of 18%, or $784 million and the decrease in sales of storage products of 22%, or $95 million were partially offset by increased revenue from our lan fixed-configuration switches of 1%, or $128 million. revenue from our modular switches decreased driven by lower sales of most of the cisco catalyst series switches and cisco nexus 7000 series switches, partially offset by growth in cisco nexus 9500 series switches within this product category. revenue from lan fixed-configuration switches increased due to higher sales of our cisco nexus 9300 series switches, cisco catalyst 3650 series switches and cisco catalyst 3850 series switches, partially offset by a decrease in sales of certain other products in this portfolio.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015
we believe the flat revenue in our switching product category was driven in large part by the uncertainty in the macro environment which led to a slowdown in customer spending. this led to flat revenue in our switching products used in campus environments which comprise the majority of revenue within this product category. we also experienced decreased revenue from storage products.
46
these impacts were offset by an increase in sales of our switching products used in data centers, reflecting strength in our aci portfolio.
in terms of subcategories, the increase in revenue from lan fixed-configuration switches of 5%, or $452 million was substantially offset by decreased revenue from our modular switches of 8%, or $375 million, and the decreased revenue from storage products of 17%, or $89 million. revenue from our lan-fixed configuration switches increased due primarily to higher sales of our cisco catalyst 3850 series switches, cisco catalyst 3650 series switches, cisco nexus 9300 series switches and cisco nexus 3000 series switches, partially offset by a decrease in sales of certain other products in this portfolio. decreased revenue from our modular switches was due primarily to lower sales of most of our cisco catalyst series switches and also due to lower sales of our cisco nexus 7000 series switches, partially offset by sales growth in cisco nexus 9500 series switches within this product category.
ngn routing fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016
revenue in our ngn routing product category decreased by 4%, or $302 million, driven by an 8%, or $211 million, decrease in revenue from our midrange and low-end router products and a 5%, or $208 million, decrease in revenue from our high-end router products. these declines were partially offset by a 10%, or $117 million, increase in revenue from other ngn routing products. revenue from our midrange and low-end router products decreased due to lower sales of our cisco isr products and certain of our access router products. the decrease in revenue from high-end router products was driven by a decrease in revenue from our mobility products within our asrs and from our crs products. revenue from other ngn routing products increased due to higher sales of cable access products and certain optical networking products.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015
we believe a cautious service provider capital expenditure spending environment negatively impacted sales in ngn routing. revenue in this product category decreased by 3%, or $210 million, driven by an 8%, or $378 million, decrease in revenue from our high-end router products partially offset by a 12%, or $126 million, increase in revenue from what we categorize as other ngn routing products and a 2%, or $42 million, increase in revenue from our mid-range and low-end router products. revenue from high-end router products decreased due to a decrease in revenue from most of our high-end router products, partially offset by higher sales of our crs-x products. revenue from other ngn routing products increased due to higher sales of optical networking products. the revenue increase in the mid-range and low-end routers was primarily driven by higher sales of cisco isr products.
collaboration fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016
revenue from our collaboration product category decreased by 2%, or $74 million, driven by a decrease in sales of cisco unified communications and cisco telepresence products, partially offset by continued growth in conferencing revenue. the decrease in unified communications revenue was driven primarily by decreased revenue from phones. revenue from cisco telepresence products declined due to lower revenue from endpoint products. the growth in conferencing revenue resulted from higher usage and recurring saas revenue from webex, which we include as product revenue in this category. we continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our collaboration product category.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015
revenue from our collaboration product category increased by 9%, or $348 million, driven by growth across the various subcategories within this product category. the growth in conferencing revenue resulted from higher usage and recurring revenue from webex. revenue from cisco telepresence products grew due to higher revenue in infrastructure and endpoint products as a result of new product introductions. the increase in unified communications revenue was driven by higher software revenue.
47
data center fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016
revenue in our data center product category decreased by 4%, or $137 million, driven by a decrease in sales of our cisco unified computing system products, with declines in the commercial, enterprise and public sector markets partially offset by growth in the service provider market. we believe that both the uncertainty in the macro environment and the continued market transition with computing workloads shifting from blade server systems to rack-based systems continued to affect customer spending.  the decrease in sales of our cisco unified computing system products was partially offset by an increase in sales of our hyperconverged offering, hyperflex.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015
the increase in revenue in our data center product category of 5%, or $146 million, was primarily driven by an increase in sales of our cisco unified computing system products, with growth across all geographic segments and most of the customer markets. we believe the uncertainty in the macro environment led to a slowdown of customer spending for products in this category and we are seeing a market transition with computing workloads shifting from blade server systems to rack-based systems.
wireless fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016
revenue in our wireless product category increased by 5%, or $126 million, due primarily to continued growth in sales of meraki products within this product category, and an increase in sales of certain of our access point products, partially offset by a decrease in sales of our controller products. we continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our wireless product category.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015
revenue in our wireless product category increased by 3%, or $89 million, due primarily to continued growth in sales of meraki products within this category, partially offset by a decrease in sales of our controllers products.
security fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016

(1) productivity includes overall manufacturing-related costs, such as component costs, warranty expense, provision for inventory, freight, logistics, shipment volume, and other items not categorized elsewhere.
product gross margin decreased by 0.4 percentage points as compared with fiscal 2016. the decrease in product gross margin was largely due to unfavorable impacts from product pricing, lower productivity benefits, and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by a benefit from the divestiture of the lower margin sp video cpe business in fiscal 2016.
the negative pricing impact was driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets. while productivity was positive to overall product gross margin, the benefit was lower than the prior year as these improvements were adversely impacted by an increase in the cost of certain memory components which are currently constrained. we expect the higher costs related to the constraint on these memory components to continue to impact productivity in the near term. in addition, productivity was negatively impacted by decreases in core routing and switching revenue which limited our ability to generate cost savings. productivity improvements were driven by value engineering efforts (e.g. component redesign, board configuration, test processes, and transformation processes), lower warranty expenses and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations. the decrease in product gross margin was also due to an unfavorable mix of products sold driven by negative mix impacts from our ngn routing, switching and iot products.

amortization of purchased intangible assets                         0.6                 %
rockstar patent portfolio charge                                    0.5                 %
product pricing                                                    (2.2                )%
mix of products sold                                               (0.8                )%
supplier component remediation charge/adjustment                   (0.2                )%
fiscal 2016                                                        62.0                 %
product gross margin increased by 2.7 percentage points compared with fiscal 2015. the increase in product gross margin was due in large part to productivity improvements, which were driven primarily by value engineering efforts; favorable component pricing; and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations. our product gross margin also benefited from the sale during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 of our lower margin sp video cpe business, lower amortization expense and impairment charges related to acquisition-related intangible assets, and a $188 million charge to product cost of sales recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 related to the rockstar consortium patent portfolio.
50
the various factors contributing to the product gross margin increase were partially offset by unfavorable impacts from product pricing, which were driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets, an unfavorable mix of products sold and the lower supplier component remediation adjustment. the unfavorable mix of products sold was due to a negative mix impact from our cisco unified computing system products, higher sales of service provider video products (not including the cpe business) and an unfavorable mix within switching products.
service gross margin fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016
our service gross margin percentage increased by 1.2 percentage points due to higher sales volume, decreased delivery costs, favorable mix and, to a lesser extent, lower share-based compensation expense. these benefits to service gross margin were partially offset by increased headcount-related costs.
our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business. other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015
service gross margin percentage increased by 1.6 percentage points due to higher sales volume and decreased headcount-related costs. these benefits to gross margin were partially offset by increased partner delivery costs and increased outside services costs.

(1) the unallocated corporate items include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, significant litigation and other contingencies, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, and certain other charges. we do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments.
fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016
the americas segment experienced a slight gross margin percentage decrease due to negative impacts from pricing and product mix, partially offset by productivity improvements and the sale of the lower margin sp video cpe business. the unfavorable mix impact was driven by ngn routing, switching and iot products.
the gross margin percentage increase in our emea segment was due primarily to higher service gross margin. product gross margin in this segment also increased slightly due to the impact of productivity improvements, the sale of the lower margin sp video cpe business and a favorable product mix, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing.
the apjc segment gross margin percentage increased due primarily to higher service gross margin. product gross margin in this segment decreased due to negative impacts from pricing and product mix, partially offset by productivity improvements. the unfavorable mix impact was driven by our cisco unified computing system products.
the gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate, and period-to-period changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment.
51
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015
the americas segment experienced a gross margin percentage increase due primarily to the sale of the lower margin sp video cpe business. in this geographic segment, productivity improvements were substantially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing and product mix. the unfavorable mix of products sold was due to increased revenue from our lower margin cisco unified computing system products and an unfavorable mix within our ngn routing products.
the gross margin percentage increase in our emea segment was due primarily to the impact of productivity improvements in this geographic segment and the sale of the sp video cpe business. partially offsetting these favorable impacts to gross margin were negative impacts from pricing and an unfavorable product mix. the unfavorable mix of products sold was due primarily to increased revenue from our lower margin cisco unified computing system products. higher service gross margin also contributed to the increase in the overall gross margin in this geographic segment.
our apjc segment gross margin percentage increased due to productivity improvements, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing and mix. the mix impact was driven primarily by higher sales from our service provider video products (not including the sp video cpe business) and unfavorable mix within our ngn routing products.

our fiscal 2017 had one less week compared with fiscal 2016, which had an extra week. we estimate that the extra week in fiscal 2016 contributed approximately $116 million of the year-over-year decrease in total operating expenses (not including share-based compensation expense).
r&d expenses fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016
r&d expenses decreased primarily due to lower contracted services, lower headcount-related expenses, lower discretionary spending and lower acquisition-related costs, partially offset by higher share-based compensation expense. lower headcount- related expenses were due to efficiencies related to our restructuring actions and the extra week in fiscal 2016.
we continue to invest in r&d in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion. if we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products, we may purchase or license technology from other businesses, or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal r&d.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015
r&d expenses increased primarily due to higher headcount-related expenses attributable in part to the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 and, to a lesser extent, higher share-based compensation expense. these increases were partially offset by lower acquisition-related costs and lower discretionary spending.
sales and marketing expenses fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016
sales and marketing expenses decreased due to lower headcount-related expenses, lower contracted services, lower discretionary spending, lower acquisition-related costs and, to a lesser extent, lower share-based compensation expense. lower headcount-related expenses were due to efficiencies related to our restructuring actions. the extra week in fiscal 2016 also contributed to the decrease in headcount-related expenses.
52
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015
sales and marketing expenses decreased due to lower discretionary spending and lower headcount-related expenses. the aforementioned items benefited from foreign exchange rates during fiscal 2016. lower share-based compensation expense also contributed to the decrease.
g&a expenses fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016
g&a expenses increased primarily due to the $253 million pre-tax gain from the sale of our sp video cpe business recorded during fiscal 2016 and, to a lesser extent, higher share-based compensation expense. these increases were partially offset by lower headcount-related expenses and lower contracted services. the extra week in fiscal 2016 contributed to the decreased headcount-related expense.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015
g&a expenses decreased primarily due to the $253 million pre-tax gain from the sale of our sp video cpe business and, to a lesser extent, lower contracted services and lower share-based compensation expense, partially offset by higher headcount-related expenses. the extra week in fiscal 2016 contributed to the increased headcount-related expenses.
effect of foreign currency in fiscal 2017, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased the combined r&d, sales and marketing, and g&a expenses by approximately $77 million, or 0.4%, compared with fiscal 2016. in fiscal 2016, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased the combined r&d, sales and marketing, and g&a expenses by approximately $567 million, or 3.1%, compared with fiscal 2015.

the increase in share-based compensation expense for fiscal 2017, as compared with fiscal 2016, was due primarily to higher expense related to equity awards assumed with respect to our recent acquisitions.
the increase in share-based compensation expense for fiscal 2016, as compared with fiscal 2015, was due primarily to the timing of restricted stock unit (rsu) grants and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016, partially offset by lower net expense associated with accelerated and modified awards.

53
amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased in fiscal 2017, as compared with fiscal 2016, due to certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized and lower impairment charges in fiscal 2017, partially offset by amortization of purchased intangible assets from our recent acquisitions.
amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased in fiscal 2016 as compared with fiscal 2015, due to certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized or impaired, partially offset by amortization of purchased intangible assets from our recent acquisitions. lower impairment charges in fiscal 2016 also contributed to the decrease.
restructuring and other charges in august 2016, we announced a restructuring plan that will impact up to 6,600 employees, with estimated pretax charges of approximately $850 million. in connection with this restructuring plan, we incurred charges of $756 million during fiscal 2017. these charges were related primarily to severance and other one-time termination benefits and other associated costs. we expect the restructuring action to be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018. we expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from the restructuring action in our key priority areas such as security, iot, collaboration, next generation data center and cloud. as a result, the overall cost savings from the restructuring action are not expected to be material for future periods.
in connection with a restructuring action announced in august 2014, we incurred restructuring and other charges of $267 million and $489 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. these charges were related primarily to severance and other one-time termination benefits and other associated costs. we completed this plan at the end of fiscal 2016.

for fiscal 2017, as compared with fiscal 2016, operating income decreased by 5%, and as a percentage of revenue operating income decreased by 0.8 percentage points. these decreases resulted primarily from an increase in restructuring and other charges related to the restructuring action announced in august 2016 and the $253 million pre-tax gain from the sale of our sp video cpe business recorded in fiscal 2016.
for fiscal 2016, as compared with fiscal 2015, operating income increased by 18%, and as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 3.8 percentage points. the increase resulted from the following: a gross margin percentage increase, driven in part by the sale of the lower margin sp video cpe business during fiscal 2016; the $253 million pre-tax gain from the sale of our sp video cpe business; and a decrease in restructuring and other charges related to the restructuring action announced in august 2014.

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016
interest income increased driven by an increase in our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and fixed income investments as well as higher yields on our portfolio. the increase in interest expense was driven by higher average debt balances which includes commercial paper notes and the impact of higher effective interest rates on floating-rate senior notes and interest rate swaps associated with fixed-rate senior notes.

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016
the change in total net gains (losses) on available-for-sale investments was driven by $74 million of impairment charges on publicly traded equity securities.
the change in net gains (losses) on investments in privately held companies was primarily due to higher impairment charges on investments in privately held companies, partially offset by higher realized gains on investments in privately held companies.
the change in other gains (losses), net was driven by lower donation expense partially offset by impacts from customer lease terminations, foreign exchange and equity derivatives.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015
the change in total net gains (losses) on available-for-sale investments was primarily attributable to lower realized gains on publicly traded equity securities and net losses on fixed income securities in fiscal 2016 compared to net gains in fiscal 2015 as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities.
the change in net gains (losses) on investments in privately held companies was primarily due to a gain of $126 million related to the reorganization of our investment in vce, which was recorded in fiscal 2015.
the change in other gains (losses), net was driven by higher donation expenses and net unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by higher gains from customer lease terminations.

provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates, higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates, and expiration of or lapses in tax incentives. our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for u.s. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to reinvest indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries. if these earnings were distributed from the foreign subsidiaries to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, we would be subject to additional u.s. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates. our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes.
fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016
the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 21.8% for fiscal 2017, compared with 16.9% for fiscal 2016. the net 4.9 percentage point increase in the effective tax rates was primarily due to the recognition of a net benefit to the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2016 related to our settlement with the irs of all outstanding items covering fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2010 and reinstatement of the u.s. federal r&d tax credit on december 18, 2015.
for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes, see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015
the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 16.9% for fiscal 2016, compared with 19.8% for fiscal 2015. the net 2.9 percentage point decrease in the effective tax rates was primarily due to a non-recurring net tax benefit of $367 million, or 2.8 percentage points, related to a tax settlement with the irs in fiscal 2016.
liquidity and capital resources the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends, our contractual obligations, and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources.
balance sheet and cash flows cash and cash equivalents and investments the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments (in millions):
july 29, 2017        july 30, 2016            increase (decrease)
cash and cash equivalents               $11,708               $7,631                       $4,077
fixed income securities                  57,077               56,621                          456
publicly traded equity securities         1,707                1,504                          203
total                                   $70,492              $65,756                       $4,736
the net increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 was primarily the result of cash provided by operating activities of $13.9 billion and a net increase in debt of $5.3 billion. these sources of cash were partially offset by cash returned to shareholders in the form of cash dividends of $5.5 billion and repurchases of common stock of $3.7 billion under the stock repurchase program, net cash paid for acquisitions of $3.3 billion, the timing of settlements of investments and other of $1.1 billion and capital expenditures of $1.0 billion.
our total in cash and cash equivalents and investments held by various foreign subsidiaries was $67.5 billion and $59.8 billion as of july 29, 2017 and july 30, 2016, respectively. under current tax laws and regulations, if these assets were to be distributed from the foreign subsidiaries to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional u.s. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. the balance of cash and cash equivalents and investments available in the united states as of july 29, 2017 and july 30, 2016 was $3.0 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively.
we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. we classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our fixed income investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. we believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below.

free cash flow and capital allocation  as part of our capital allocation strategy, we intend to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment. the following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions):
years ended                                      july 29, 2017        july 30, 2016        july 25, 2015
net cash provided by operating activities       $13,876              $13,570              $12,552
acquisition of property and equipment              (964      )        (1,146      )        (1,227      )
free cash flow                                  $12,912              $12,424              $11,325
we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to as shipment linearity), the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables, inventory and supply chain management, deferred revenue, excess tax benefits resulting from share-based compensation, and the timing and amount of tax and other payments. for additional discussion, see "part i, item 1a. risk factors" in this report.
we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. we further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments. a limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period.  in addition, we have other required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net income provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do.

accounts receivable, net   $5,146               $5,847               $(701             )
our accounts receivable net, as of july 29, 2017 decreased by approximately 12% compared with the end of fiscal 2016, primarily due to service and product billings being more linear in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.

inventory supply chain the following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers (in millions, except annualized inventory turns):
july 29, 2017            july 30, 2016        increase (decrease)
inventories                                                           $1,616                   $1,217                     $399
annualized inventory turns                                              12.3          14.6                                (2.3        )
purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers        $4,640                   $3,896                     $744
inventory as of july 29, 2017 increased by 33% from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2016, and for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by approximately 19%. on a combined basis, inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by 22% compared with the end of fiscal 2016. the increase in inventory was due to an increase in raw materials due to securing memory supply which is currently constrained and higher levels of manufactured finished goods in support of current order activity. the increase in purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was due to securing memory supply and procuring key components for specific product areas. we believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts.
our finished goods consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales and manufactured finished goods. distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales are related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to distributors and retail partners as well as shipments to customers. manufactured finished goods consist primarily of build-to-order and build-to-stock products.
we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. during the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity. a significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. in certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity.
inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. we believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels.
financing receivables and guarantees the following table summarizes our financing receivables (in millions):
july 29, 2017        july 30, 2016            increase (decrease)
lease receivables, net                 $2,650               $3,070                        $(420        )
loan receivables, net                   4,457                3,349                        1,108

financing receivables our financing arrangements include leases, loans, and financed service contracts. lease receivables include sales-type and direct-financing leases. arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. our loan receivables include customers financing purchases of our hardware, software and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. we also provide financing to certain qualified customers for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services. the majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed. financing receivables increased by 14% primarily due to a 33% increase in loan receivables driven by an increase in financing for software arrangements. we expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term.
financing guarantees in the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. the financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. in some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. the financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. in certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. the receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms.
58
the volume of channel partner financing was $27.0 billion, $26.9 billion, and $25.9 billion in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. these financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. the balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion as of july 29, 2017 and july 30, 2016, respectively. we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. in either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. as of july 29, 2017, the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately $314 million, of which approximately $134 million was recorded as deferred revenue.

contractual obligations the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously. in addition, we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process. the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at july 29, 2017 (in millions):

operating leases for more information on our operating leases, see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. a significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. we record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. see further discussion in "inventory supply chain." as of july 29, 2017, the liability for these purchase commitments was $162 million and is recorded in other current liabilities and is not included in the preceding table.
other purchase obligations other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations.
long-term debt the amount of long-term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
other long-term liabilities other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately $1,250 million and deferred tax liabilities of $271 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions (see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).
other commitments in connection with our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
insieme networks, inc. in fiscal 2012, we made an investment in insieme, an early stage company focused on research and development in the data center market. this investment included $100 million of funding and a license to certain of our technology. during fiscal 2014, we acquired the remaining interests in insieme, at which time the former noncontrolling interest holders became eligible to receive up to two milestone payments, which were determined using agreed-upon formulas based primarily on revenue for certain of insieme's products. the former noncontrolling interest holders earned the maximum amount related to these two milestone payments and were paid approximately $441 million and $389 million during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. during fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, we recorded compensation expense of $47 million, $160 million and $207 million, respectively, related to these milestone payments. we do not expect a material amount of future compensation expense or further milestone payments related to this acquisition.
61
other funding commitments we also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our investments in privately held companies and venture funds, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. the funding commitments were $216 million as of july 29, 2017, compared with $222 million as of july 30, 2016.
off-balance sheet arrangements we consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be off-balance sheet arrangements. in the ordinary course of business, we have investments in privately held companies including venture funds and provide financing to certain customers. certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities. we evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and customer financings, and we have determined that as of july 29, 2017 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities.
on an ongoing basis, we reassess our investments in privately held companies and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. as a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events.
we provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end-user customers. we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. see the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under "financing receivables and guarantees."
securities lending we periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale investments. these transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis. the average daily balance of securities lending for fiscal 2017 and 2016 was $0.7 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively. we require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. we engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. as of july 29, 2017 and july 30, 2016, we had no outstanding securities lending transactions. we believe these arrangements do not present a material risk or impact to our liquidity requirements.
liquidity and capital resource requirements based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, pending acquisitions, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. there are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for, capital resources.

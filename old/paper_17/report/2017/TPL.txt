item 1a. risk factors.
an investment in our securities involves a degree of risk. the risks described below are not the only ones facing us. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on us. if any of the following risks actually occur, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or business could be harmed. in that case, the market price of our securities could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.
global economic conditions may materially and adversely affect our business.
our business and results of operations are affected by international, national and regional economic conditions. a recurrence of recessionary conditions in the united states and elsewhere may lead to reduced industrial production which, in turn, may lead to lower demand and lower prices for oil and gas, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
we face the risks of doing business in a new and rapidly evolving market and may not be able to successfully address such risks and achieve acceptable levels of success or profits.
we have encountered and may continue to encounter the challenges, uncertainties and difficulties frequently experienced in new and rapidly evolving markets with respect to the business of tpwr, including:
•   limited operating experience;

4
•                              start-up costs for a new line of business;

•   lack of sufficient customers or loss of significant customers for the new line of business; and
•   difficulties in managing potentially rapid growth.
the trust's oil and gas royalty revenue is dependent upon the market prices of oil and gas which fluctuate.
the oil and gas royalties which the trust receives are dependent upon the market prices for oil and gas. the market prices for oil and gas are subject to national and international economic and political conditions and, in the past, have been subject to significant price fluctuations. price fluctuations for oil and gas have been particularly volatile in recent years. although the trust's oil and gas royalties benefited from the substantial increases in the market prices for oil and gas in past years, when lower market prices for oil and gas occur, they will have an adverse effect on our oil and gas royalty revenues.
the trust is not an oil and gas producer. its revenues from oil and gas royalties are subject to the actions of others.
the trust is not an oil and gas producer. its oil and gas income is derived from perpetual non-participating oil and gas royalty interests which it has retained. as oil and gas wells age, the costs of production may increase and their capacity may decline absent additional investment. however, the owners and operators of the oil and gas wells make all decisions as to investments in, and production from, those wells and the trust's royalties will be dependent upon decisions made by those operators, among other factors. the railroad commission of the state of texas sets authorized production levels for pro-rated wells by regulation. the monthly percentage of allowable production has averaged 100% in recent years. however, in the past, the trust's income from oil and gas royalties has been limited by the production levels authorized by the railroad commission and we cannot assure you that they may not be so limited in the future.
our revenues from the sale of land are subject to substantial fluctuation. we are a passive seller of land and land sales are subject to many factors that are beyond our control.
land sales vary widely from year to year and quarter to quarter. the total dollar amount, the average price per acre, and the number of acres sold in any one year or quarter should not be assumed to be indicative of future land sales. the trust is a passive seller of land and does not actively solicit sales of land. the demand for, and the sale price of, any particular tract of the trust's land is influenced by many factors, including the national and local economies, rate of oil and gas well development by operators, the rate of residential and commercial development in nearby areas, livestock carrying capacity and the condition of the local agricultural industry, which itself is influenced by range conditions and prices for livestock and agricultural products. approximately 97% of the trust's land is classified as ranch land and intermingled with parcels owned by third parties to form ranching units. the trust's ability to sell ranch land is, therefore, largely dependent on the actions of adjoining landowners.
the impact of government regulation on tpwr could adversely affect our business.
the business of tpwr is subject to applicable state and federal laws and regulations, including laws and regulations on environmental and safety matters. these laws and regulations may increase the costs and timing of planning, designing, drilling, installing, operating and abandoning water wells and treatment facilities. tpwr's business could be affected by problems, slowdowns or other stoppages to operations of providing water treatment critical to the success of tpwr.
the trust's remaining holdings of land in metropolitan areas are limited.
the sale price of land suitable for development in metropolitan areas is generally substantially higher than the price of land in rural or ranching areas. the trust's remaining holdings of land suitable for development in metropolitan areas are limited.

the loss of key members of our management team, or difficulty attracting and retaining experienced technical personnel, could reduce our competitiveness and prospects for future success.
the successful implementation of our strategies and handling of other issues integral to our future success will depend, in part, on our experienced management team, including with respect to the business of tpwr. the loss of key members of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business. if we cannot retain our experienced personnel or attract additional experienced personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.
if the liability of holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub-shares were to be found to be governed by the laws of texas, holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub-shares might be held to have personal liability for claims against the trust, to the extent such claims exceeded the assets of the trust.
the declaration of trust, which established the trust, was executed and delivered in new york. under the laws of the state of new york, the holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub-shares are not subject to any personal liability for the acts or obligations of the trust. the assets of the trust are located in texas. under the laws of the state of texas, the holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub-shares may be held personally liable with respect to claims against the trust, but only after the assets of the trust first have been exhausted. thus, if a court were to hold that the liability of holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub-shares for obligations is governed by the laws of texas, rather than new york, it is possible that holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub-shares might be held to have personal liability for claims against the trust to the extent such claims exceeded all of the trust's assets.
the trustees are not subject to annual election and, as a result, the ability of the holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub-shares to influence the policies of the trust may be limited.
directors of a corporation are generally subject to election at each annual meeting of stockholders or, in the case of staggered boards, at regular intervals. under the declaration of trust, however, the trust is not required to hold annual meetings of holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub-shares to elect trustees and trustees generally hold office until their death, resignation or disqualification. as a result, the ability of holders of certificates of proprietary interest and sub-shares to effect changes in the board of trustees, and the policies of the trust, is significantly more limited than that of the stockholders of a corporation.
our results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of our results of operations for a full year.
sales of land fluctuate from quarter to quarter. revenues from oil and gas royalties may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon market prices for oil and gas and production decisions made by the operators. water sales and royalties may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter. as a result, the results of our operations for any particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion and analysis should be read together with the factors discussed in item 1a "risk factors" and with the consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. period-to-period comparisons of financial data are not necessarily indicative, and therefore should not be relied upon as indicators, of the trust's future performance. words or phrases such as "does not believe" and "believes," or similar expressions, when used in this form 10-k or other filings with the sec, are intended to identify "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
overview the trust was organized in 1888 and holds title to extensive tracts of land in numerous counties in west texas which were previously the property of the texas and pacific railway company. we continue to manage those lands for the benefit of the holders of certificates of proprietary interest in the trust (and/or sub-shares in the certificates of proprietary interest).
our revenues are derived primarily from oil, gas and water royalties, sales of water and land, easements and leases of the land. due to the nature of our operations, our revenue is subject to substantial fluctuations from quarter to quarter and year to year. we are a passive seller of land and do not actively solicit sales of land. in addition, the demand for, and sale price of, particular tracts of land is influenced by many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, the rate of development in nearby areas and the suitability of the particular tract for the ranching uses prevalent in western texas.
we are not an oil and gas producer. rather, our oil and gas revenue is derived from our retained perpetual non-participating oil and gas royalty interests. thus, in addition to being subject to fluctuations in response to the market prices for oil and gas, our oil and gas royalty revenues are also subject to decisions made by the owners and operators of the oil and gas wells to which our royalty interests relate as to investments in and production from those wells. we monitor production reports by the oil and gas companies to assure that we are being paid the appropriate royalties. we review conditions in the agricultural industry in the areas in which our lands are located and seek to keep as much of our lands as possible under lease to local ranchers. in recent years, we have been successful at keeping over 97% of our land subject to grazing leases.
our revenue from easements is generated from easement contracts covering activities such as oil and gas pipelines and subsurface wellbore easements. the majority of our easements have a ten-year term. we also enter into agreements with operators and mid-stream companies to lease land from us, primarily for facilities and roads.
in prior years, we entered into agreements with energy companies and oilfield service businesses to allow such companies to explore for water, drill water wells, construct water-related infrastructure and purchase water sourced from land that we own. energy businesses use water for their oil and gas projects while non-energy businesses (i.e. water management service companies) operate water facilities to produce and sell water to energy businesses. we collect revenue from royalties and water sales under these legacy agreements.
demand for water solutions is expected to grow as drilling and completion activity in the permian basin continues to rise. in response to that anticipated demand, the trust announced the formation of tpwr in june 2017. for more information about tpwr, see item 1. "business" in this annual report on form 10-k. tpwr, a single member llc and wholly owned subsidiary of the trust, focuses on providing full-service water offerings to operators in the permian basin. these services include brackish water sourcing, produced-water gathering/treatment/recycling, infrastructure development/construction, disposal, water tracking, analytics and well testing services. tpwr is committed to sustainable water development with significant focus on the large-scale implementation of recycled water operations.

results of operations we operate our business in two segments: land and resource management and water service and operations. we eliminate any inter-segment revenues and expenses upon consolidation.
we analyze financial results for each of our reportable segments. the reportable segments presented are consistent with our reportable segments discussed in note 9, "business segment reporting" in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data. we monitor our reporting segments based upon revenue and net income calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap").
year ended december 31, 2017 compared to year ended december 31, 2016
revenues. revenues increased $72.4 million, or 120.9% to $132.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $59.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. net income increased $39.2 million, or 105.1% to $76.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $37.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2016.

land and resource management land and resource management segment revenues increased $49.2 million, or 95.1%, to $101.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared with revenues of $51.8 million for the comparable period of 2016.
oil and gas royalties. oil and gas royalty revenue was $61.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $30.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. oil royalty revenue was $38.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $22.0 million for the comparable period of 2016. this increase in oil royalty revenue is principally due to the combined effect of a 43.8% increase in crude oil production, subject to the trust's royalty interest, and a 22.6% increase in the average price per royalty barrel of crude oil during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. gas royalty revenue was $14.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of 85.3% over the year ended december 31, 2016 when gas royalty revenue was $8.0 million. this increase in gas royalty revenue resulted from a volume increase of 59.8% for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the same period of 2016, and a 16.0% increase in the average price received. additionally, oil and gas royalties for the year ended december 31, 2017 included $7.7 million related to an arbitration settlement with chevron u.s.a., inc. see part i, item 1. business for additional information. no such settlements were received for the year ended december 31, 2016.
11
easements and sundry income. easements and sundry income was $39.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, an increase of 112.6% compared to $18.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. this increase resulted primarily from increases in pipeline easement income, temporary permit income, material sales of caliche and, to a lesser extent, sundry lease rental income. pipeline easement income increased 140.7% to $41.5 million (before deferral of term easements) for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. during the year ended december 31, 2017, $26.0 million of easement income was deferred compared to $7.8 million for the same period of 2016. material sales increased 481.1% to $7.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016. easements and sundry income is unpredictable and may vary significantly from period to period. effective january 1, 2018, upon the trust's adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, we will no longer defer revenue on our term easements. see more discussion in note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies - recent accounting pronouncements" for further discussion and analysis of impact on our consolidated financial statements.
land sales and other income. land sales and other income includes revenue generated from land sales and grazing leases. for the year ended december 31, 2017, we sold approximately 11.02 acres of land for total consideration of $0.2 million, or approximately $20,000 per acre. for the year ended december 31, 2016, land sales generated $2.9 million of income for selling approximately 774.6 acres at an average price of $3,803 per acre. grazing lease income was approximately $0.5 million for both years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016.
net income. net income for the land and resource management segment was $57.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $32.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. as discussed above, revenues for the land and resource management segment increased $49.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016. expenses for the land and resource management segment were $10.5 million and $4.8 million for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the increase in expenses was principally related to increased salary expense and legal and professional fees. see further discussion of these expenses below under "other financial data - consolidated."
water service and operations water service and operations segment revenues increased $23.2 million, or 285.2%, to $31.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared with revenues of $8.1 million for the comparable period of 2016.
water sales and royalties. water sales and royalty revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017 of $25.5 million were more than three times the amount of revenue for the comparable period of 2016. this increase is due primarily to the trust's decision to develop water well fields on its own land along with an increase in the royalties received from existing agreements.
easements and sundry income. easements and sundry income for the water service and operations segment includes pipeline easement royalties, commercial lease royalties and income from temporary permits. for the year ended december 31, 2017, the combined revenue from these revenue streams was $5.8 million. there was no such revenue for the year ended december 31, 2016.
net income. net income for the water service and operations segment was $18.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $5.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. as discussed above, revenues for the water service and operations segment increased $23.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016. expenses for the water service and operations segment were $2.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 while depreciation was the only expense for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase in expenses during 2017 is directly related to the formation of tpwr.
12
other financial data - consolidated taxes, other than income taxes. taxes, other than income taxes, were $3.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $1.8 million for the comparable period of 2016. oil and gas production taxes were $2.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $1.6 million for the same period of 2016. the increase in oil and gas production taxes was directly related to the increase in oil production and gas volume for the year ended december 31, 2017 over the year ended december 31, 2016 as discussed above. additionally, payroll taxes increased approximately $0.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016 due to an increase in the number of employees during 2017.
salaries and related employee benefits. salaries and related employee benefits were $3.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $1.2 million for the comparable period of 2016. the increase in salaries and related employee benefits is directly related to the increase in the number of employees from eight employees as of december 31, 2016 to 26 as of december 31, 2017.
general and administrative expenses. general and administrative expenses increased $0.8 million to $1.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 from $1.0 million for the same period of 2016. approximately $0.4 million of the increase is related to an increase in insurance expenses which are partially attributable to the increase in the number of employees during 2017. travel expenses, office rent and other general expenses increased as a result of the opening of an additional office in midland, texas for our tpwr operations.
water service-related expenses. water service-related expenses of $0.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, include expenses for equipment rental, propane and fuel and other equipment-related expenses associated with tpwr. the trust did not incur water service-related expenses during 2016.
legal and professional expenses. legal and professional fees increased $2.7 million to $3.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 from $0.8 million for the comparable period of 2016. the increase is principally related to legal and consulting fees related to the formation of tpwr as well as consulting fees related to a strategic review of the trust.
year ended december 31, 2016 compared to year ended december 31, 2015
revenues. revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 aggregated $59.9 million, a decrease of $19.5 million, or 24.6%, from the $79.4 million recorded in the same period of 2015. this decrease resulted primarily from decreases in land sales and, to a lesser extent, easements and sundry income. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in oil and gas royalties.
the following is an analysis of our operating results for the comparable periods by reportable segment (in thousands):
years ended december 31,

2016                                     2015

land and resource management land and resource management segment revenues decreased $22.8 million, or 30.6%, to $51.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared with revenues of $74.6 million for the comparable period of 2015.
oil and gas royalties. oil and gas royalty revenue for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $30.0 million compared to $24.9 million for the same period of 2015, an increase of 20.7%. oil royalty revenue was $22.0 million and gas royalty revenue was $8.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. crude oil production, subject to the trust's royalty interest, increased 48.3% for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. this increase in production was offset by a 20.3% decrease in the average price per royalty barrel of crude oil received during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. total gas production subject to the trust's royalty interest increased 36.8%, and the average price of gas received decreased by 6.1% for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the comparable period of 2015.
easements and sundry income. easements and sundry income for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $18.3 million compared to $26.6 million for the same period of 2015, a decrease of 31.1%. this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in the amount of pipeline easement income to $9.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $18.2 million for the same period of 2015. during 2016, the trust changed its historical policy of allowing perpetual easements in favor of term easements. term easements require that revenue from the easements be recognized over the term of the agreement, which is generally 10 years. as a result, $7.8 million of easement income received for the year ended december 31, 2016 was deferred and therefore not reflected in the statements of income and total comprehensive income in the current year. the decrease in pipeline easement income was partially offset by an increase in sundry lease rental income and sundry income. easements and sundry income is unpredictable and may vary significantly from period to period.
land sales and other income. land sales and other income for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $3.4 million compared to $23.1 million for the same period of 2015 a decrease of $19.7 million, or 85.1%. a total of approximately 774.6 acres were sold during the year ended december 31, 2016 at an average price of $3,803 per acre, compared to 20,941 acres during the year ended december 31, 2015 at an average price per acre of $1,080.
net income. net income for the land and resource management segment was $32.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $46.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. net income for the year ended december 31, 2015 included $22.6 million of revenue generated by land sales (pre-tax) while net income for the year ended december 31, 2016 only included land sales (pre-tax) of $2.9 million. this decrease was partially offset by increased oil and gas royalties for the year ended december 31, 2016 over the same period of 2015.
water service and operations water sales and royalties. water sales and royalty revenues for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 were $8.1 million and $4.8 million, respectively. the increase of $3.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 over the comparable period of 2015 is generally attributable to an increase in royalties received from existing agreements with operators.
net income. net income for the water service and operations segment was $5.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $3.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. this increase is directly related to the increase in water royalty revenues during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the same period of 2015.

all other expenses. all other expenses were $3.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $2.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. this increase resulted primarily from expenses related to the data conversion portion of a project that began in the third quarter of 2015 to enhance the information systems of the trust and, to a lesser extent, increases in legal and professional fees and salaries and related employee benefits expense.
cash flow analysis year ended december 31, 2017 compared to year ended december 31, 2016
cash flows provided by operating activities for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 were $93.8 million and $41.0 million, respectively. this increase in operating cash flows is principally due to increases in oil and gas royalties collected, easements and sundry payments received and water sales and royalties collected during the year ended december 31, 2017 over the year ended december 31, 2016.
cash flows used in investing activities were $18.7 million compared to $1.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the increased use of investing cash flows is due to our investment of $17.7 million in water service-related assets during 2017.
cash flows used in financing activities were $44.9 million compared to $35.6 million for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. during the year ended december 31, 2017, the trust paid a special dividend of $1.00 per sub-share to each sub-shareholder of record at the close of business on march 9, 2017 totaling $7.9 million on march 16, 2017. no special dividends were paid for the year ended december 31, 2016.
year ended december 31, 2016 compared to year ended december 31, 2015
cash flows provided by operating activities for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 were $41.0 million and $49.6 million, respectively. this decrease in operating cash flows is principally due to the decrease in land sales from $22.6 million in the year ended december 31, 2015 to $2.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. this effect was partially offset by increased water royalties and increased oil and gas royalties collected during the year ended december 31, 2016 over the same period of 2015.
cash flows used in investing activities were nominal for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
cash flows used in financing activities were $35.6 million compared to $31.2 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, the trust repurchased 190,750 sub-shares for a cost of $33.1 million and 204,335 sub-shares for a cost of $28.8 million, respectively.
liquidity and capital resources the trust's principal sources of liquidity are its revenues from oil, gas and water royalties, easements and sundry income, and water and land sales.
our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for capital expenditures related to our water service and operations segment, working capital and general corporate needs. as of december 31, 2017, we had a cash and cash equivalents balance of $79.6 million that we expect to utilize, along with cash flow from operations, to provide capital to support the growth of our business, particularly the growth of tpwr, to repurchase additional sub-share certificates subject to market conditions, and for general corporate purposes. we believe that cash from operations, together with our cash and cash equivalents balances, will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future.
off-balance sheet arrangements the trust has not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements.

effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our operating results. we cannot assure you, however, that future increases in our costs will not occur or that any such increases that may occur will not adversely affect our results of operations.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. it is our opinion that we fully disclose our significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. consistent with our disclosure policies, we include the following discussion related to what we believe to be our most critical accounting policies that require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgment.
valuation of real estate acquired through foreclosure the value of real estate acquired through foreclosure is established at the lower of cost or fair value less disposition costs at the date of foreclosure. cost is considered to be the aggregate of the outstanding principal and interest, past due ad valorem taxes and other fees associated with the foreclosure. subsequent to the foreclosure date, valuations are periodically performed or obtained by management when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the full carrying amount may not be recoverable. at such time, a valuation allowance is established to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value. valuation of the real estate is based on the estimates of management and is subject to judgment. at december 31, 2017 and 2016, no valuation allowances were recorded.
gain recognition on land sales any gain or loss on the sale of land is calculated in accordance with gaap. the trust has established policies for the sale of land which result in the full accrual method of gain recognition. this policy generally requires that the trust receive a minimum cash down payment of 25% of the sales price on each sale and that any related notes receivable require regular principal and interest payments, payable over terms from 5 to 15 years.

item 1a.    risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this report and could individually, or in combination, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. these risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this report, including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. our separate section above, "cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information," should be considered in addition to the following statements.
a sustained slowdown or significant downturn in our markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
many of our on- and off-highway markets are cyclical in nature and experience volatility in demand throughout these cycles. although in 2017 we experienced demand growth in most of our north american and chinese on-highway markets and certain off-highway markets as well as growth in many of our international markets, if the north american or chinese markets suffer a significant downturn or if a slower pace of economic growth and weaker demand in our other significant international markets were to occur, depending upon the length, duration and severity of the slowdown, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows would likely be materially adversely affected.
our truck manufacturers and oem customers may discontinue outsourcing their engine supply needs.
several of our engine customers, including paccar, volvo , navistar, fiat chrysler, daimler and dongfeng, are truck manufacturers or oems that manufacture engines for some of their own vehicles. despite their own engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products, our emission compliance capabilities, our systems integration, their customers' preferences, their desire for cost reductions, their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus. however, there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource, or outsource as much of, their engine production in the future. in fact, several of these customers have expressed their intention to significantly increase their own engine production and to decrease engine purchases from us. in addition, increased levels of oem vertical integration could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers' business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or oem customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
the development of new technologies may materially reduce the demand for our current products and services.
we are investing in new products and technologies, including electrified powertrains, for planned introduction into certain existing and new markets.  given the early stages of development of some of these new products and technologies, there can be no guarantee of the future market acceptance and investment returns with respect to these planned products.  the increased adoption of electrified powertrains in some market segments could result in lower demand for current diesel or natural gas engines and components and, over time, reduce the demand for related parts and service revenues from diesel or natural gas powertrains. furthermore, it is possible that we may not be successful in developing segment-leading electrified powertrains and some of our existing customers could choose to develop their own electrified or alternate fuel powertrains, or source from other manufacturers, and any of these factors could materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
the discovery of any significant additional problems with our engine platforms or aftertreatment systems in north america could further materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
during 2017, the carb and u.s. epa selected certain of our pre-2013 model year engine systems for additional emissions testing. some of these engine systems failed carb and epa's tests as a result of degradation of an aftertreatment component. we have not been issued an official notice from the carb or epa regarding these particular engine systems. we are working with the agencies and will meet with them beginning in the first quarter of 2018, to develop a resolution of these matters. we are developing and testing a variety of solutions to address the technical issues, which could include a combination of calibration changes, service practices and hardware changes.
in addition, we continue to evaluate other engine systems for model years 2010 through 2015 that could potentially be subject to similar aftertreatment component degradation issues.  at the close of 2017, we had not yet determined the impact to other model years or engine systems or the percentage of the engine system populations that could be affected.
since there are many unresolved variables with respect to these degradation issues, we are not yet able to estimate the financial impact of these matters. it is possible that they could have a material impact on our results of operations in the periods in which these degradation issues are resolved and a solution is determined.
our products are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues.
our products may be subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. product recalls subject us to harm to our reputation, loss of current and future customers, reduced revenue and product recall costs. product recall costs are incurred when we decide, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue. any significant product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. see note 12, "commitments and contingencies" to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
lower-than-anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products or services, including reductions in demand for diesel engines, could materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
although we conduct market research before launching new or refreshed engines and introducing new services, many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing products and services in the marketplace. offering engines and services that customers desire and value can mitigate the risks of increasing price competition and declining demand, but products and services that are perceived to be less than desirable (whether in terms of price, quality, overall value, fuel efficiency or other attributes) can exacerbate these risks. with increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet, social media and other media, mere allegations relating to poor quality, safety, fuel efficiency, corporate responsibility or other key attributes can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of our products or services, even if such allegations prove to be inaccurate or unfounded.
a slowdown in infrastructure development and/or depressed commodity prices could adversely affect our business.
infrastructure development and strong commodity prices have been significant drivers of our historical growth, but as the pace of investment in infrastructure slowed in recent years (especially in china and brazil), commodity prices were significantly lower and demand for our products in off-highway markets was weak. weakness in commodities, such as oil, gas and coal, adversely impacted mining industry participants' demand for vehicles and equipment that contain our engines and other products over the past several years. although many of our off-highway markets began to recover in 2017, additional deterioration, or renewed weakness, in infrastructure and commodities markets could adversely affect our customers' demand for vehicles and equipment and could adversely affect our business.
unpredictability in the adoption, implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards by multiple jurisdictions around the world could adversely affect our business.
our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emission and noise, including standards imposed by the epa, the eu, state regulatory agencies (such as the carb) and other regulatory agencies around the world. we have made, and will be required to continue to make, significant capital and research expenditures to ensure our engines comply with these emission standards. developing engines and components to meet numerous changing government regulatory requirements, with different implementation timelines and emission requirements, makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets. in some cases, we are required to develop new products to comply with new regulations, particularly those relating to air emissions. while we have met previous deadlines, our ability to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our competitive advantage in the engine markets we serve. the successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks, such as delays in product development, cost over-runs and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties.in addition to these risks, the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards in emerging markets are unpredictable and subject to change. any delays in implementation or enforcement could result in the products we developed or modified to comply with these standards becoming unnecessary or becoming necessary later than expected thereby, in some cases, negating our competitive advantage. this in turn can delay, diminish or eliminate the expected return on capital and research expenditures that we have invested in such products and may adversely affect our perceived competitive advantage in being an early, advanced developer of compliant engines.
we derive significant earnings from investees that we do not directly control, with more than 50 percent of these earnings from our china-based investees.
for 2017, we recognized $357 million of equity, royalty and interest income from investees, compared to $301 million in 2016. more than half of our equity, royalty and interest income from investees is from three of our 50 percent owned joint ventures in china - beijing foton cummins engine co., ltd., dongfeng cummins engine company, ltd. and chongqing cummins engine company, ltd. as a result, although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities, we do not unilaterally control their management or their operations, which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these entities. a significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.
the adoption of new tax legislation, changes in our provisional estimates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability.
on december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted the tax cuts and jobs act (tax legislation). the estimated effects based upon current interpretation of the tax legislation have been incorporated into our financial results. as additional data is prepared and analyzed and as additional clarification and implementation guidance is issued on the new tax law, it may be necessary to adjust the provisional amounts. any adjustments could have a material impact on provisional amounts. in addition, there is a risk that states or foreign jurisdictions may amend their tax laws in response to the tax legislation, which could have a material impact on our future results.
we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous international jurisdictions. our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the u.s., is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the u.s. we are also subject to ongoing tax audits. these audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental. tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us. we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision.
we are exposed to, and may be adversely affected by, potential security breaches or other disruptions to our information technology systems and data security.
we rely on the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology systems and data security infrastructure in connection with various aspects of our business activities. we also rely on our ability to expand and continually update these systems and related infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. as we implement new systems, they may not perform as expected. we also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades. in addition, some of these systems are managed by third party service providers and are not under our direct control. if we experience a problem with an important information technology system, including during system upgrades and/or new system implementations, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. as customers adopt and rely on the cloud-based digital technologies and services we offer, any disruption of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of those services could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.
the data handled by our information technology systems is vulnerable to security threats. our operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, customers, dealers, suppliers, employees and other sensitive matters. information technology security threats, such as security breaches, computer malware and other "cyber attacks," which are increasing in both frequency and sophistication, could result in unauthorized disclosures of information and create financial liability, subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions, or damage our reputation with customers, dealers, suppliers and other stakeholders. we continuously seek to maintain a robust program of information security and controls, but the impact of a material information technology event could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
financial distress or a change-in-control of one of our large truck oem customers could materially adversely impact our results of operations.
we recognize significant sales of engines and components to a few large on-highway truck oem customers in north america which have been an integral part of our positive business results for several years. if one of our large truck oem customers experiences financial distress, bankruptcy or a change-in-control, such circumstance could likely lead to significant reductions in our revenues and earnings, commercial disputes, receivable collection issues, and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
our plan to reposition our portfolio of product offerings through exploring strategic acquisitions and divestitures may expose us to additional costs and risks.
part of our strategic plan is to improve our gross margins and earnings by exploring the repositioning of our portfolio of product line offerings through the pursuit of potential strategic acquisitions and/or divestitures to provide future strategic, financial and operational benefits and improve shareholder value. there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms. the successful identification and completion of any strategic transaction depends on a number of factors that are not entirely within our control, including the availability of suitable candidates and our ability to negotiate terms acceptable to all parties involved, conclude satisfactory agreements and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. accordingly, we may not be able to successfully negotiate and complete specific transactions. the exploration, negotiation and consummation of strategic transactions may involve significant expenditures by us, which may adversely affect our results of operations at the time such expenses are incurred, and may divert management's attention from our existing business. strategic transactions also may have adverse effects on our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers.if required, the financing for strategic acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness, dilute the interests of our shareholders or both. any acquisition may not be accretive to us for a significant period of time following the completion of such acquisition. also, our ability to effectively integrate any potential acquisition into our existing business and culture may not be successful, which could jeopardize future financial and operational performance for the combined businesses. in addition, if an acquisition results in any additional goodwill or increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet and subsequently becomes impaired, we would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge, which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.similarly, any strategic divestiture of a product line or business may reduce our revenue and earnings, reduce the diversity of our business, result in substantial costs and expenses and cause disruption to our employees, customers, vendors and communities in which we operate.
we are vulnerable to supply shortages from single-sourced suppliers.
during 2017, we single sourced approximately 20 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs, compared to approximately 56 percent in 2016. any delay in our suppliers' deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations, forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions. delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers, including capacity constraints, labor disputes, economic downturns, availability of credit, the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, weather emergencies, natural disasters or acts of war or terrorism. any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and our results of operations.
we face significant competition in the markets we serve.
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive. we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. we primarily compete in the market with diesel engines and related diesel products; however, new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline, natural gas, electrification and other technologies and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies. our products primarily compete on the basis of price, performance, fuel economy, speed of delivery, quality and customer support. we also face competitors in some emerging markets who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these markets. there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets.
increasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers' growth.
as our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope, they are increasingly seeking to export their products to other countries. this has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets, as well as greater demand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing. as these emerging market customers enter into, and begin to compete in more developed markets, they may increasingly begin to compete with our existing customers in these markets. our further aid to emerging market customers could adversely affect our relationships with developed market customers. in addition, to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in demand, we may see little or no benefit from this type of expansion by our emerging market customers.
policy changes affecting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position.
changes in government policies on foreign trade and investment can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries. our business benefits from free trade agreements, such as the north american free trade agreement, and efforts to withdraw from, or substantially modify such agreements, in addition to the implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs, import or export licensing requirements, exchange controls or new barriers to entry, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.additionally, the results of the united kingdom's referendum on eu membership, advising for the exit from the eu, has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global stock markets, currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty. although it is unknown what the terms of the united kingdom's future relationship with the eu will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the united kingdom and eu and increased regulatory complexities. any of these factors could adversely impact customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers and our results of operations.
we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate and other related risks.
we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. in addition, since our financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. although the u.s. dollar weakened in 2017, the u.s. dollar strengthened in recent years through 2016 and resulted in material unfavorable impacts on our revenues in those years. if the u.s. dollar returns to strengthening against other currencies, we will experience additional volatility in our financial statements.while we customarily enter into financial transactions that attempt to address these risks and many of our supply agreements with customers include foreign currency exchange rate adjustment provisions, there can be no assurance that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our future results of operations. in addition, while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. we also face risks arising from the imposition of foreign exchange controls and currency devaluations. foreign exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into u.s. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation. see management's discussion and analysis for additional information.
our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs.
our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames; however, the timing of material and commodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions. additionally, higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. while we customarily enter into financial transactions and contractual pricing adjustment provisions with our customers that attempt to address some of these risks (notably with respect to copper, platinum and palladium), there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations. in addition, while the use of commodity price hedging instruments and contractual pricing adjustments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price. as a result, higher material and commodity costs, as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices, could result in declining margins.
we may fail to realize all of the expected enhanced revenue, earnings, and cash flow from our investment in the eaton cummins automated transmission technologies joint venture.
our ability to realize all of the expected enhanced revenue, earnings, and cash flow from our recent investment in the eaton cummins automated transmission technologies joint venture will depend, in substantial part, on our ability to successfully launch the automated transmission products in north america and achieve our projected market penetration. while we believe we will ultimately achieve these objectives, it is possible that we will be unable to achieve all of the goals within our anticipated time frame or in the anticipated amounts. if we are not able to successfully complete our automated transmission strategy, the anticipated enhanced revenue, earnings, and cash flows resulting from this joint venture may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected. as part of the purchase accounting associated with the formation of the joint venture, significant goodwill and intangible asset balances were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. if cash flows from the joint venture fall short of our anticipated amounts, these assets could be subject to impairment charges, negatively impacting our earnings.
we are exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business.
our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries. these risks include:
•   the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;
•   trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;
•   the imposition of taxes on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the u.s.;
•   the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions;
•   difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations;
•   required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; and
•   changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets.
as we continue to operate our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. there can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us.
our global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk.
due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world. recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anti-corruption, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws from other countries, as well as new regulatory requirements regarding data privacy, such as the european union general data protection regulation. our numerous foreign subsidiaries, affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws, rules and business practices that differ from those of the u.s. the activities of these entities may not comply with u.s. laws or business practices or our code of business conduct. violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.
we face the challenge of accurately aligning our capacity with our demand.
we can experience idle capacity as economies slow or demand for certain products decline. accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity have been, and will continue to be, important factors in determining our results of operations. if we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity, we may have significantly underutilized assets and we may experience reduced margins. if we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
our business is exposed to potential product liability claims.
we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products' failure to perform to specification results, or is alleged to result, in property damage, bodily injury and/or death. at any given time, we are subject to various and multiple product liability claims, any one of which, if decided adversely to us, may have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operation in the period in which our liability with respect to any such claim is recognized. while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims. in addition, product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. furthermore, even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us.
our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations.
our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations governing air emission, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. while we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations, under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. we are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property. if a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material.
future bans or limitations on the use of diesel-powered vehicles, in an effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions, could materially adversely affect our business over the long term.
in an effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions, mayors of several large international cities announced that they plan to implement a ban on the use in their cities of diesel-powered vehicles by 2025. these cities include athens, madrid, mexico city and paris. similarly, germany adopted legislation to ban new internal combustion engine vehicles by 2030, and china is considering a ban on the production and sale of diesel-powered vehicles to be adopted in the near future. in addition, california government officials have called for the state to phase out sales of diesel-powered vehicles by 2040. to the extent that these types of bans are actually implemented in the future on a broad basis, or in one or more of our key markets, our business over the long-term could be materially adversely affected.
we are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy.
the level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy. high energy costs generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate. some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fuel economy improvements, and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected, demand for these products may likewise decrease. the relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging market countries also influences demand for our electricity generating products, such as our diesel generators. if these countries add energy capacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to or faster than the growth in demand for energy, the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case.
significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
we sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans. our pension cost and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value. we could experience increased pension cost due to a combination of factors, including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets, decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets.significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets, which could result in increased pension cost in future years and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. depending upon the severity of market declines and government regulatory changes, we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the u.s. and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material.
we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters.
at december 31, 2017, we employed approximately 58,600 persons worldwide. approximately 20,830 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2018 and 2022. while we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters, there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages, or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. in addition, many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces. work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by our customers or suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
our financial statements are subject to changes in accounting standards that could adversely impact our profitability or financial position.
our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) in the united states of america, which are periodically revised and/or expanded. accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the financial accounting standards board. recently, accounting standard setters issued new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to revenue recognition and lease accounting as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures. the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports on form 10-k and form 10-q. an assessment of proposed standards is not provided, as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and, therefore, their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial position.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations organization of information the following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) was prepared to provide the reader with a view and perspective of our business through the eyes of management and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to those financial statements. our md&a is presented in the following sections:
•   executive summary and financial highlights
•   2018 outlook
•   results of operations
•   operating segment results
•   liquidity and capital resources
•   contractual obligations and other commercial commitments
•   application of critical accounting estimates
•   recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements executive summary and financial highlights we are a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines and engine-related component products, including filtration, aftertreatment, turbochargers, fuel systems, controls systems, air handling systems, transmissions and electric power generation systems. we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers (oems), distributors and other customers worldwide. we have long-standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve, including paccar inc, daimler trucks north america, navistar international corporation and fiat chrysler automobiles. we serve our customers through a network of approximately 500 wholly-owned and independent distributor locations and over 7,500 dealer locations in more than 190 countries and territories.
our reportable operating segments consist of engine, distribution, components and power systems. this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves. the engine segment produces engines (15 liters and less in size) and associated parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various off-highway markets. our engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well as in various industrial applications, including construction, agriculture, power generation systems and other off-highway applications. the distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various oems throughout the world. the components segment sells filtration products, aftertreatment systems, turbochargers, fuel systems and transmissions. the power systems segment is an integrated power provider, which designs, manufactures and sells engines (16 liters and larger) for industrial applications (including mining, oil and gas, marine and rail), standby and prime power generator sets, alternators and other power components.
our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve, particularly the on-highway, construction and general industrial markets. demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions. our sales may also be impacted by oem inventory levels, production schedules and stoppages. economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reduced sales of our products and can result in price reductions in certain products and/or markets. as a worldwide business, our operations are also affected by currency, political, economic and regulatory matters, including adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards, in the countries we serve. as part of our growth strategy, we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of these risks such as china, brazil, india, mexico, russia and countries in the middle east and africa. at the same time, our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results.
worldwide revenues improved 17 percent in 2017 compared to 2016, with all operating segments reporting higher revenue. revenue in the u.s. and canada improved by 15 percent primarily due to increased demand in the north american on-highway markets, increased industrial demand (especially in oil and gas, construction and mining markets) and organic growth and higher sales related to the acquisition of a north american distributor in the fourth quarter of 2016. international demand growth (excludes the u.s. and canada) in 2017 improved revenues by 19 percent, with sales up in most of our markets,
30
especially in china, russia, india and the u.k. the increase in international sales was primarily due to increased demand in the truck market in china, new emission regulations in india and increased demand in industrial markets (especially construction markets in china and mining markets in europe).
on december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted the tax cuts and jobs act (tax legislation).  among other things, the tax legislation changed the u.s. statutory rate to 21 percent effective january 1, 2018.  the impact of the tax legislation resulted in a net incremental charge to our consolidated statements of income of $777 million.  the components of the 2017 charge were as follows:

"noncontrolling interests," to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
(2) noncontrolling interest was reduced for withholding taxes on foreign earnings which reduced the income eliminated for non-
cummins ownership interest attributable to cummins india, ltd.
the $781 million increase in tax expense is composed of three elements - the remeasurement of deferred taxes, a one-time transitional tax on unrepatriated earnings and withholding taxes on foreign earnings.

(1) the year ended december 31, 2016, included $138 million for loss contingency charges. see the "results of operations" section for additional information.
net income attributable to cummins inc. for 2017 was $999 million, or $5.97 per diluted share, on sales of $20.4 billion, compared to 2016 net income attributable to cummins inc. of $1.4 billion, or $8.23 per diluted share, on sales of $17.5 billion. the decrease in net income attributable to cummins inc. and earnings per diluted share was driven by a $777 million reduction for tax adjustments related to the tax legislation, increased selling, general and administrative expenses and higher research, development and engineering expenses, partially offset by higher net sales and gross margin, lower charges for a loss contingency and higher equity, royalty and interest income from investees. the increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher volumes, improved leverage and lower material costs, partially offset by higher warranty costs ($264 million primarily due to campaigns in the engine, components and power systems segments and changes in estimates in the engine and components segments) and increased variable compensation expense of $150 million. diluted earnings per share for 2017 was negatively impacted $4.65 per share due to the tax legislation, partially offset by a benefit of $0.04 per share from fewer weighted-average shares outstanding, primarily due to purchases under the stock repurchase program. see income tax expense section for additional information on the new tax legislation.

2018 outlook our outlook reflects the following positive trends and challenges to our business that we expect could impact our revenue and earnings potential in 2018:
positive trends
•   north american heavy-duty truck demand is expected to improve.
•   north american medium-duty truck demand will remain strong.
•   demand for pick up trucks in north america will remain strong.
•   industry production of medium-duty trucks in north america will remain strong.
•   market demand may continue to improve in global mining.
•   global construction markets could continue to improve.
•   economic conditions in brazil may begin to improve, which could contribute to improved demand in our end-markets.
challenges
•   market demand in truck markets in china is expected to decline.
•   marine markets are expected to remain weak.
in summary, we expect demand to improve or remain strong in many of our most important markets.

2017 vs. 2016
net sales net sales increased $2.9 billion versus 2016, primarily driven by the following:
•   engine segment sales increased 15 percent primarily due to higher demand in most north american on-highway markets and improved demand in most global construction markets.
•   components segment sales increased 22 percent due to higher demand across all businesses, especially the emission solutions business, due to strong on-highway sales in india, north america and china.
•   distribution segment sales increased 14 percent primarily due to an increase in organic sales and higher sales related to the acquisition of a north american distributor in the fourth quarter of 2016.
•   power systems segment sales increased 15 percent due to higher demand in all product lines, especially in industrial markets, due to higher demand in global mining and north american oil and gas markets.
35
sales to international markets (excluding the u.s. and canada), based on location of customers, were 42 percent of total net sales in 2017, compared with 42 percent of total net sales in 2016.
a more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the "operating segment results" section.
gross margin gross margin increased $638 million, primarily due to higher volumes, improved leverage and lower material costs, partially offset by higher warranty costs ($264 million primarily due to campaigns in the engine, components and power systems segments and changes in estimates in the engine and components segments) and increased variable compensation expense of $150 million. gross margin decreased 0.5 points as a percentage of sales due to increased warranty costs and increased variable compensation expense.
the provision for warranties issued, excluding campaigns, as a percentage of sales, was 1.8 percent in 2017 and 1.7 percent in 2016. a more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the "operating segment results" section.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses increased $344 million, primarily due to higher compensation expenses ($257 million), especially variable compensation, and higher consulting expenses ($52 million). overall, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, remained flat at 11.7 percent in 2017 and 2016.
research, development and engineering expenses research, development and engineering expenses increased $116 million, primarily due to increased compensation expense ($76 million), especially variable compensation, and higher consulting expenses ($20 million). overall, research, development and engineering expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 3.7 percent in 2017 from 3.6 percent in 2016. research activities continue to focus on development of new products to meet future emission standards around the world and improvements in fuel economy performance.
equity, royalty and interest income from investees equity, royalty and interest income from investees increased $56 million, primarily due to higher earnings at beijing foton cummins engine co. and dongfeng cummins engine company, ltd., despite $39 million of unfavorable impacts from tax legislation related to withholding taxes on foreign earnings and remeasurement of deferred taxes. see note 2, "income taxes," to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. loss contingency charges in 2017, we recorded a charge of $5 million in addition to the 2016 charge of $138 million for a loss contingency. see note 12, "commitments and contingencies," to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

income tax expense our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent u.s. statutory income tax rate, primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits. on december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted the tax cuts and jobs act (tax legislation). the tax legislation changed the u.s. statutory rate to 21 percent effective january 1, 2018. our effective tax rate for 2017 was 58.0 percent compared to 24.6 percent for 2016. the impacts of the tax legislation resulted in additional income tax expense of $781 million to our tax provision (excluding the noncontrolling interest and equity investee adjustments). see note 2, "income taxes," to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
we expect our 2018 effective tax rate to be 23 percent, excluding any discrete items (including adjustments to provisional estimates) that may arise.
noncontrolling interests noncontrolling interests eliminate the income or loss attributable to non-cummins ownership interests in our consolidated entities. noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries decreased $67 million primarily due to the $43 million impact of tax legislation on cummins india ltd. regarding withholding taxes on foreign earnings, the acquisition of the remaining interest in wuxi cummins turbo technologies co. ltd. in the fourth quarter of 2016 and elimination of the net loss of ecjv.
net income attributable to cummins inc. and diluted earnings per common share attributable to cummins inc.
net income decreased primarily due to the $777 million impact of tax legislation, increased selling, general and administrative expenses and higher research, development and engineering expenses, partially offset by higher net sales and gross margin, lower charges for a loss contingency and higher equity, royalty and interest income from investees. diluted earnings per share for 2017 was negatively impacted $4.65 per share due to the tax legislation, partially offset by a benefit of $0.04 per share from fewer weighted-average shares outstanding, primarily due to purchases under the stock repurchase program. see note 2, "income taxes," to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
2016 vs. 2015
net sales net sales decreased $1.6 billion versus 2015, primarily driven by the following:
•   engine segment sales decreased 10 percent primarily due to lower demand in north american heavy-duty and medium-duty on-highway markets and lower demand in most north american off-highway markets, partially offset by increased sales in the light-duty automotive market.
•   power systems segment sales decreased 14 percent primarily due to lower demand in all product lines and decreased sales in most regions with the largest declines in north america, asia, china, latin america, the middle east, africa and western europe.
•   components segment sales decreased 6 percent primarily due to lower demand in most lines of business, principally in north american on-highway markets, partially offset by higher demand in china.
•   foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales by approximately 2 percent primarily in the british pound, chinese renminbi, indian rupee, brazilian real, south african rand, canadian dollar and australian dollar.
sales to international markets (excluding the u.s. and canada), based on location of customers, were 42 percent of total net sales in 2016, compared with 39 percent of total net sales in 2015.
a more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the "operating segment results" section.
gross margin gross margin decreased $495 million and 0.5 points as a percentage of sales, primarily due to lower volumes, unfavorable mix and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations (primarily in the brazilian real, south african rand and canadian dollar), partially offset by lower material and commodity costs, improved distribution segment margins related to the acquisition of north american distributors since december 31, 2014 and lower warranty expense.
the provision for warranties issued, excluding campaigns, as a percentage of sales was 1.7 percent in 2016 and 1.8 percent in 2015. a more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the "operating segment results" section.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $46 million, primarily due to lower compensation expenses of $56 million as a result of restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2015. compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. overall, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 11.7 percent in 2016 from 10.9 percent in 2015.
research, development and engineering expenses research, development and engineering expenses decreased $99 million, primarily due to reduced project spending in most of our segments, decreased compensation expenses as a result of restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2015, and lower consulting expenses. overall, research, development and engineering expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 3.6 percent in 2016 from 3.8 percent in 2015. research activities continue to focus on development of new products to meet future emission standards around the world and improvements in fuel economy performance.
equity, royalty and interest income from investees equity, royalty and interest income from investees decreased $14 million, primarily due to the consolidation of partially-owned north american distributors of $12 million and lower earnings at beijing foton cummins engine co., ltd. of $10 million, partially offset by higher earnings at other joint ventures.
loss contingency charges in 2016, we recorded charges of $138 million in addition to the 2015 charge of $60 million for a loss contingency. see note 12, "commitments and contingencies," to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
impairment of light-duty diesel assets in 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $211 million on our light-duty diesel assets. see note 19, "impairment of light-duty diesel assets," to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
restructuring actions and other charges in 2015, we incurred a charge of $90 million, which included $86 million for the severance costs related to both voluntary and involuntary terminations and $4 million for asset impairments and other charges. see note 20, "restructuring actions and other charges," to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

income tax expense our effective tax rate for 2016 was 24.6 percent compared to 27.4 percent for 2015. the 2.8 percent decrease in our effective tax rate from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to favorable changes in the jurisdictional mix of pre-tax income.
noncontrolling interests noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries decreased $9 million primarily due to lower earnings as a result of the consolidation of north american distributors since december 31, 2014 and lower earnings at cummins india ltd.
net income attributable to cummins inc. and diluted earnings per common share attributable to cummins inc.
net income was relatively flat as significantly lower gross margin and higher loss contingency charges were mostly offset by the absence of 2015 impairment and restructuring charges, in addition to lower research, development and engineering expenses, a lower effective tax rate, lower selling, general and administrative expenses and favorable changes to corporate owned life insurance. diluted earnings per share for 2017 benefited $0.26 per share from lower shares outstanding, primarily due to purchases under the stock repurchase program.

2017 vs. 2016
sales engine segment sales increased $1.1 billion versus 2016. the following were the primary drivers by market:
•   heavy-duty truck engine sales increased $397 million primarily due to higher demand in north american heavy-duty truck markets with increased shipments of 20 percent.
•   off-highway sales increased $365 million primarily due to improved demand in global industrial markets, especially in international construction markets, with increased unit shipments of 54 percent primarily in china and western europe.
•   medium-duty truck and bus sales increased $241 million primarily due to higher demand in north american medium-duty truck markets with increased engine shipments of 20 percent.
•   light-duty automotive sales increased $146 million primarily due to higher sales to chrysler and higher sales of light commercial vehicles, partially offset by lower sales to nissan.
total on-highway-related sales for 2017 were 79 percent of total engine segment sales, compared to 81 percent in 2016.
segment ebit engine segment ebit increased $273 million versus 2016, primarily due to improved gross margin, lower loss contingency charges and increased equity, royalty and interest income from investees, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and higher research, development and engineering expenses. major components of ebit and related changes to segment ebit and ebit as a percentage of sales were as follows:

the increase in gross margin versus 2016 was primarily due to higher volumes, partially offset by increased warranty costs for campaigns, changes in estimates and higher variable compensation expense. gross margin as a percentage of sales declined primarily due to the increased warranty costs and increased variable compensation expense. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher compensation expense, especially variable compensation expense, and higher consulting expenses. the increase in research, development and engineering expenses was primarily due to higher compensation expense, especially higher variable compensation expense, and higher consulting expenses. the increase in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was primarily due to higher earnings at beijing foton cummins engine co. and dongfeng cummins engine company, ltd., despite unfavorable impacts from tax legislation related to withholding taxes on foreign earnings and remeasurement of deferred taxes of $23 million.
2016 vs. 2015
sales engine segment sales decreased $866 million versus 2015. the following were the primary drivers by market:
•   heavy-duty truck sales decreased $673 million primarily due to lower demand in the north american heavy-duty truck market with decreased engine shipments of 38 percent.
•   medium-duty truck and bus sales decreased $235 million primarily due to lower demand in most global medium-duty truck markets with decreased engine shipments of 17 percent, primarily in north america, brazil and mexico.
•   off-highway sales decreased $64 million primarily due to decreased engine shipments in several north american industrial markets, partially offset by increased unit shipments of 25 percent in international construction markets.
the decreases above were partially offset by an increase in light-duty automotive sales of $106 million primarily due to new sales for the nissan pickup truck platform launched in the second half of 2015.
total on-highway-related sales for 2016 were 81 percent of total engine segment sales, compared to 82 percent in 2015.
segment ebit in 2016, we recorded additional charges of $138 million for an existing loss contingency in addition to the $60 million recorded in 2015. in 2015, we also incurred an impairment charge of $202 million for our light-duty diesel assets and incurred a restructuring charge of $17 million for actions primarily in the form of professional voluntary and involuntary employee separation programs in response to the continued deterioration in our global markets.
engine segment ebit increased $50 million versus 2015, primarily due to an impairment of light-duty diesel assets in 2015, lower selling, general and administrative expenses, lower research, development and engineering expenses and restructuring actions and other charges in 2015, partially offset by lower gross margin and higher loss contingency charges in 2016. major components of ebit and related changes to segment ebit and ebit as a percentage of sales were as follows:

"nm" - not meaningful information the increase in gross margin versus 2016 was primarily due to higher organic volumes and the acquisition of a north american distributor in the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by increased variable compensation expense. gross margin as a percentage of sales declined primarily due to the increase in variable compensation expense. the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher variable compensation expense, increased compensation expense related to the acquisition of a north american distributor and higher consulting expenses. the decrease in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was the result of the acquisition of a north american distributor in 2016 and unfavorable impacts from tax legislation related to withholding taxes on foreign earnings of $4 million.
2016 vs. 2015
sales distribution segment sales decreased $48 million versus 2015, primarily due to a decline in organic sales of $295 million principally in north america, asia pacific and the middle east and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations (primarily in the south african rand, canadian dollar, chinese renminbi, indian rupee, australian dollar and british pound), partially offset by $344 million of segment sales related to the acquisition of north american distributors since december 31, 2014.
segment ebit in 2015, we incurred a restructuring charge of $23 million for actions primarily in the form of professional voluntary and involuntary employee separation programs in response to the continued deterioration in our global markets.

(1) see restructuring actions and other charges section of "results of operations" for additional information.
the decrease in gross margin versus 2015 was primarily due to lower volumes and increased project costs. the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower compensation expenses as the result of restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2015 and lower consulting expenses. the decrease in research, development and engineering expenses was primarily due to reduced project spending, lower consulting expenses and lower compensation expenses as the result of restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2015. the decrease in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was primarily due to the impact of an $8 million asset impairment incurred by one of our joint ventures. in 2016, we sold our remaining 49 percent interest in cummins olayan energy for $61 million and recognized a gain of $17 million.

2017 vs. 2016
net cash provided by operating activities increased $338 million versus 2016, primarily due to improved earnings of $358 million, excluding the non-cash impact of tax legislation of $820 million and lower working capital levels of $352 million, partially offset by higher pension contributions of $109 million, a decrease in deferred tax expense of $104 million, lower loss contingency charges of $117 million and higher equity earnings of $77 million. the lower working capital requirements in 2017 resulted in a cash inflow of $90 million compared to a cash outflow of $262 million in 2016.
net cash used in investing activities increased $135 million versus 2016, primarily due to higher acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired of $568 million and the absence of $60 million in proceeds from the sale of of equity investees in 2016, partially offset by lower net investments in marketable securities of $244 million, higher cash flows from derivatives not designated as hedges of $178 million and higher proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment of $96 million.
net cash used in financing activities decreased $339 million versus 2016, primarily due to lower repurchases of common stock of $327 million.
the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents increased $298 million versus 2016, primarily due to the british pound, which increased cash and cash equivalents $249 million.
2016 vs. 2015
net cash provided by operating activities decreased $126 million versus 2015, primarily due to the absence of the 2015 impairment of light-duty diesel assets of $211 million and a $123 million year over year impact related to restructuring, partially offset by an increase in deferred income taxes of $158 million and higher loss contingency charges of $62 million resulting in lower cash net income in 2016.
52
net cash used in investing activities decreased $1 million versus 2015, primarily due to lower capital expenditures of $213 million and proceeds from the sale of equity investees of $60 million, partially offset by higher net investments in marketable securities of $160 million and changes in cash flows from derivatives not designated as hedges of $110 million.
net cash used in financing activities decreased $237 million versus 2015, primarily due to higher net borrowings of commercial paper of $212 million, lower common stock repurchases of $122 million and higher proceeds from borrowings of $67 million, partially offset by higher acquisitions of noncontrolling interests of $88 million and higher payments on borrowings and capital lease obligations of $87 million.
the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents decreased $113 million versus 2015, primarily due to the british pound, which decreased cash and cash equivalents $112 million.
sources of liquidity we generate significant ongoing cash flow. cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity with $2.3 billion provided in 2017.
at december 31, 2017, our sources of liquidity included:

(1) the majority of marketable securities could be liquidated into cash within a few days.
(2) the five-year credit facility for $1.75 billion and the 364-day credit facility for $1.0 billion, maturing november 2020 and september 2018, respectively, are maintained primarily to provide backup liquidity for our commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes. at december 31, 2017, we had $298 million of commercial paper outstanding, which effectively reduced the $1.75 billion available capacity under our five-year revolving credit facility to $1.45 billion.
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities a significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the u.s. we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. as a result, we do not anticipate any local liquidity restrictions to preclude us from funding our operating needs with local resources.
the tax legislation made significant changes to u.s. tax law, including a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings of $298 million with a cash impact of $338 million. the payments associated with this deemed repatriation will be paid over eight years. the unrepatriated foreign earnings at december 31, 2017, will be repatriated as needed to fund cash needs. the estimated accrued withholding taxes of $331 million on foreign earnings that we plan to repatriate in the foreseeable future will be paid as cash is repatriated. see note 2, "income taxes," to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
debt facilities and other sources of liquidity on november 13, 2015, we entered into an amended and restated five-year revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders, which provides us with a $1.75 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and expires on november 13, 2020. on september 5, 2017, we entered into a 364-day credit facility that allows us to borrow up to $1 billion of additional unsecured funds at any time through september 2018. we have access to both credit facilities which total $2.75 billion of borrowing capacity. we intend to maintain credit facilities of a similar aggregate amount by renewing or replacing these facilities before expiration. revolving credit facilities are maintained primarily to provide backup liquidity for our commercial paper borrowings, letters of credit and general corporate purposes.
53
we can issue up to $1.75 billion of unsecured short-term promissory notes ("commercial paper") pursuant to our board authorized commercial paper programs. the programs facilitate the private placement of unsecured short-term debt through third party brokers. we intend to use the net proceeds from the commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes.
the total combined borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper program should not exceed $2.75 billion. see note 9, "debt," to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
as a well-known seasoned issuer, we filed an automatic shelf registration for an undetermined amount of debt and equity securities with the securities and exchange commission (sec) on february 16, 2016. under this shelf registration we may offer, from time to time, debt securities, common stock, preferred and preference stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units.
uses of cash stock repurchases in december 2016, our board of directors authorized the acquisition of up to $1 billion of additional common stock upon completion of the 2015 repurchase plan. in 2017, we made the following purchases under the 2015 repurchase program:

(1) the remaining authorized capacity under the 2015 plan was calculated based on the cost to purchase the shares but excludes commission expenses in accordance with the authorized plan.
we intend to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time during 2018 to enhance shareholder value and to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans.
dividends total dividends paid to common shareholders in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $701 million, $676 million and $622 million, respectively. declaration and payment of dividends in the future depends upon our income and liquidity position, among other factors, and is subject to declaration by our board of directors, who meet quarterly to consider our dividend payment. we expect to fund dividend payments with cash from operations.
in july 2017, our board of directors authorized an increase to our quarterly dividend of 5.4 percent from $1.025 per share to $1.08 per share. in july 2016, our board of directors authorized an increase to our quarterly dividend of 5.1 percent from $0.975 per share to $1.025 per share. in july 2015, our board of directors authorized an increase to our quarterly dividend of 25 percent from $0.78 per share to $0.975 per share. cash dividends per share paid to common shareholders for the last three years were as follows:

acquisitions on july 31, 2017, we formed a joint venture with eaton corporation plc by purchasing a 50 percent interest in the new venture named eaton cummins automated transmission technologies (ecjv) for $600 million in cash. in addition, each partner contributed $20 million for working capital. see note 18 "acquisitions," to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
54
on november 1, 2017, we acquired brammo inc., an engineerer and manufacturer of lithium ion batteries primarily related to the utility vehicle markets, for $68 million. see note 18 "acquisitions," to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
capital expenditures capital expenditures, including spending on internal use software, were $587 million in 2017, compared to $594 million in 2016. we continue to invest in new product lines and targeted capacity expansions. we plan to spend between $730 million and $760 million in 2018 on capital expenditures as we continue with product launches and facility improvements. approximately 50 percent of our capital expenditures are expected to be invested outside of the u.s. in 2018.
pensions the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets, market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans. in 2017, the investment return on our u.s. pension trust was 12.9 percent while our u.k. pension trust return was 4.4 percent. approximately 77 percent of our pension plan assets are held in highly liquid investments such as fixed income and equity securities. the remaining 23 percent of our plan assets are held in less liquid, but market valued investments, including real estate, private equity, venture capital, opportunistic credit and insurance contracts.
we sponsor funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans. contributions to these plans were as follows:

we anticipate making total contributions of approximately $38 million to our defined benefit pension plans in 2018. expected contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2018 will meet or exceed the current funding requirements.
current maturities of short and long-term debt we had $298 million of commercial paper outstanding at december 31, 2017, that matures in less than one year. the maturity schedule of our existing long-term debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term. required annual principal payments range from $6 million to $63 million over the next five years. see note 9 "debt"to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

management's assessment of liquidity our financial condition and liquidity remain strong. our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable us to have ready access to credit and the capital markets. we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. we believe our operating cash flow and liquidity provides us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividend payments, projected pension obligations and debt service obligations. while we expect more efficient access to overseas earnings as a result of tax legislation, we continue to generate cash from operations in the u.s. and maintain access to our revolving credit facility as noted above.

the contractual obligations reported above exclude our unrecognized tax benefits of $41 million as of december 31, 2017. we are not able to reasonably estimate the period in which cash outflows relating to uncertain tax contingencies could occur. see note 2, "income taxes," to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.application of critical accounting estimates a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1, "summary of significant accounting policies," of our consolidated financial statements which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives.
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. (gaap) which often requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements. management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. in any given reporting period, our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting estimates are defined as follows: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies, related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of our board of directors. we believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs, accounting for income taxes and pension benefits.
57
warranty programs we estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold. our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management's best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ. as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs, the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action or when a recall becomes probable and estimable, which generally occurs when it is announced. our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates, repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle. future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability. new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch, with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch. we generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a preceding product's warranty history and a multiplicative factor based upon preceding similar product experience and new product assessment until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation. we then use a blend of actual new product experience and preceding product historical experience for several subsequent quarters, and new product specific experience thereafter. note 8, "product warranty liability," to our consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2017, 2016 and 2015 including adjustments to pre-existing warranties.
accounting for income taxes we determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. future tax benefits of net operating loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets. we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets. at december 31, 2017, we recorded net deferred tax liabilities of $85 million. the assets included $359 million for the value of net operating loss and credit carryforwards. a valuation allowance of $347 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized. in the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets.
on december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted the tax cuts and jobs act (tax legislation). we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the tax legislation. we made provisional estimates of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances, the one-time transition tax, and the withholding tax accrued on those earnings not permanently reinvested at december 31, 2017. the final transition impacts of the tax legislation may differ from our estimates, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations for the tax legislation, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the tax legislation, any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the tax legislation, or any updates or changes to estimates the company has utilized to calculate the transition impacts. final calculations will be completed within the one year measurement period ending december 22, 2018, as required under the rules issued by the sec. any change of provisional amounts will be reported in income from continuing operations in the period in which the initial estimates are revised. in addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. these audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. we accrue for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions. we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available. a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in note 2, "income taxes," to our consolidated financial statements.
pension benefits we sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the u.s. and the u.k. and to a lesser degree in various other countries. in the u.s. and the u.k., we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded. we account for our pension programs in accordance with employers' accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans under gaap. gaap requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis. as a result, our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at december 31. these assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities, assumed rates of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, employee turnover rates, actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age, mortality rates and participant withdrawals. the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions, participant life span and withdrawal rates. these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension cost to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the future.
the expected long-term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension cost. we considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets. the long-term rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations. projected returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded passive fixed income and equity indices and forward-looking estimates of the value added by active investment management. at december 31, 2017, based upon our target asset allocations, it is anticipated that our u.s. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 10-year projection period equal to or in excess of 6.5 percent approximately 32 percent of the time while returns of 7.0 percent or greater are anticipated 21 percent of the time, including the additional positive returns expected from active investment management.
our plan assets have averaged annualized returns of 10.5 percent over the prior eight years, and resulted in approximately $418 million of actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensive income in the same period. based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations, we believe an investment return assumption of 6.5 percent per year in 2018 for u.s. pension assets is reasonable.
the methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the u.k. was based on establishing an equity-risk premium over current long-term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations. at december 31, 2017, based upon our target asset allocations, it is anticipated that our u.k. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20-year projection period equal to or in excess of 4.1 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 4.8 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time. we expect modest additional positive returns from active investment management. the one-year return for our u.k. plans was 4.4 percent for 2017, and similar to our u.s. plans, the strong returns since 2010 have resulted in approximately $383 million of actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensive income. our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a long-term outlook. therefore, the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a long-term horizon. based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations as the plan assets continue to be de-risked, we believe an investment return assumption of 4.0 percent in 2018 for u.k. pension assets is reasonable. our pension plan asset allocations at december 31, 2017 and 2016 and target allocation for 2018 are as follows:
u.s. plans                                                                             u.k. plans target allocation                   percentage of plan assets at december 31,          target allocation                   percentage of plan assets at december 31, investment description                       2018                       2017                             2016                       2018            2017                             2016

the differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected long-term return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic cost over five years. the table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension cost for the period 2015-2017 and our expected rate of return for 2018.
long-term expected return assumptions
2018              2017              2016              2015
u.s. plans       6.50     %        7.25     %        7.50     %        7.50     %

a lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension cost and reduce profitability.
gaap for pensions offers various acceptable alternatives to account for the differences that eventually arise between the estimates used in the actuarial valuations and the actual results. it is acceptable to delay or immediately recognize these differences. under the delayed recognition alternative, changes in pension obligations (including those resulting from plan amendments) and changes in the value of assets set aside to meet those obligations are not recognized in net periodic pension cost as they occur but are recognized initially in accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently amortized as components of net periodic pension cost systematically and gradually over future periods. in addition to this approach, gaap also allows immediate recognition of actuarial gains or losses. immediate recognition introduces volatility in financial results. we have chosen to delay recognition and amortize actuarial differences over future periods. if we adopted the immediate recognition approach, we would record a loss of $864 million ($680 million after-tax) from cumulative actuarial net losses for our u.s. and u.k. pension plans.
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds 10 percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation, amortized over future years of service. this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions. under gaap, the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. at december 31, 2017, we had net pension actuarial losses of $649 million and $207 million for the u.s. and u.k. pension plans, respectively. as these amounts exceed 10 percent of their respective plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees. net actuarial losses decreased our shareholders' equity by $28 million after-tax in 2017. the loss is due to lower discount rates in the u.s. and u.k. and unfavorable foreign currency, partially offset by strong asset performance in the u.s. and the u.k.
the table below sets forth the net periodic pension cost for the years ended december 31 and our expected cost for 2018.
in millions                 2018            2017            2016            2015
net periodic pension cost         $79             $82             $42             $63
we expect 2018 net periodic pension cost to decrease compared to 2017, primarily due to reduced loss amortization in the u.s. and u.k., which resulted from strong asset performance, partially offset by lower expected asset returns in the u.s. and u.k. as we de-risk plan trust assets. the increase in net periodic pension cost in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to onboarding north american distributors to cummins pension benefits, a lower expected rate of return in the u.s. and u.k. and lower discount rates in the u.s. and u.k. the decrease in net periodic pension cost in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to reduced loss amortizations in the u.s. and u.k. and higher discount rates in the u.s. and u.k., partially offset by lower expected asset returns in the u.k. as we de-risked plan trust assets. another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension cost is the discount rate. the weighted-average discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension cost are set forth in the table below.
discount rates
2018          2017          2016          2015
u.s. plans      3.66   %      4.12   %      4.47   %      4.07   %
u.k. plans      2.55   %      2.70   %      3.95   %      3.80   %
changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension cost calculation.
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. the guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in gaap which suggests the use of a high-quality corporate bond rate. we used bond information provided by moody's investor services, inc. and standard & poor's rating services. all bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the u.s. and u.k. were deemed high-quality, non-callable bonds (aa or better) at december 31, 2017, by at least one of the bond rating agencies.
our model called for projected payments until near extinction for the u.s. and the u.k. for both countries, our model matches the present value of the plan's projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio. a single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow with the value of the bond portfolio. the resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plan's distinct liability characteristics.
the table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2018 net periodic pension cost relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets.
in millions         impact on pension cost increase/(decrease)
discount rate used to value liabilities
0.25 percent increase                              $(16                )
0.25 percent decrease                                17
expected rate of return on assets
1 percent increase                               (48                )
1 percent decrease                                48
60
the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. a higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension cost. a lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension cost. it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. note 10, "pension and other postretirement benefits," to our consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity, the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements.

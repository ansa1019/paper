item 1a.   risk factors

for an enterprise as large and complex as we are, a wide range of factors could materially affect future results and performance. the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully. in addition, these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
financial risks and risks of operation our revenues and the value of our properties are subject to conditions affecting the lodging industry.
the performance of the lodging industry traditionally has been affected by the strength of the general economy and, specifically, growth in gross domestic product ("gdp"). because lodging industry demand typically follows the general economy, the lodging industry is cyclical, which contributes to potentially large fluctuations in our financial condition and results of operations. changes in travel patterns of both business and leisure travelers, particularly during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth, may create difficulties for the industry over the long-term and adversely affect our results of operations.
in addition, the majority of our hotels are classified as luxury or upper upscale and generally target business and high-end leisure travelers. in periods of economic difficulties, business and leisure travelers may seek to reduce travel costs by limiting travel or seeking to reduce costs of their trips. consequently, our hotels may be more susceptible to a decrease in revenue during an economic downturn, as compared to hotels in other categories that have lower room rates.  for instance, reductions in overall travel and reductions in travel to luxury and upper upscale hotels during the recession in 2008 and 2009 significantly affected our results of operations.
other circumstances affecting the lodging industry which may affect our performance and the forecasts we make include:
•   the effect on lodging demand of changes in national and local economic and business conditions, including concerns about the duration and strength of u.s. economic growth, global economic prospects, consumer confidence and the value of the u.s. dollar;

•   factors that may shape public perception of travel to a particular location, such as natural disasters, weather events, pandemics and outbreaks of contagious diseases such as the zika virus, and the occurrence or potential occurrence of terrorist attacks, all of which will affect occupancy rates at our hotels and the demand for hotel products and services;

•   risks that the limited travel ban to the united states and proposed immigration policies will suppress international travel to the united states generally;

•   the impact of geopolitical developments outside the u.s., such as the pace of economic growth in europe, the effects of the united kingdom's referendum to withdraw from the european union, the slowing of growth in markets such as china and brazil, or unrest in the middle east, which could affect global travel and lodging demand, including with respect to our foreign hotel properties;

•   volatility in global financial and credit markets, and the impact of budget deficits and pending and future u.s. governmental action to address such deficits through reductions in spending and similar austerity measures, which could materially adversely affect u.s. and global economic conditions, business activity, credit availability, borrowing costs, and lodging demand;

•   operating risks associated with the hotel business, including the effect of increasing operating or labor costs or changes in workplace rules that affect labor costs;

•   the ability of our hotels to compete effectively against other lodging businesses in the highly competitive markets in which we operate in areas such as access, location, quality of accommodations and room rate structures;

•   changes in the desirability of the geographic regions of the hotels in our portfolio or in the travel patterns of hotel customers;

•   changes in taxes and governmental regulations that influence or set wages, hotel employee health care costs, prices, interest rates or construction and maintenance procedures and costs;

•   the ability of third-party internet and other travel intermediaries to attract and retain customers; and

•   decreases in the frequency of business travel that may result from alternatives to in-person meetings, including virtual meetings hosted online or over private teleconferencing networks.

we cannot assure you that adverse changes in the general economy or other circumstances that affect the lodging industry will not have an adverse effect on the hotel revenue or earnings at our properties. a reduction in our revenue or earnings as a result of the above risks may reduce our working capital and revenue, impact our long-term business strategy and impact the value of our assets and our ability to meet certain covenants in our existing debt agreements. in addition, we may incur impairment charges in the future,
16
which charges will affect negatively our results of operations. we can provide no assurance that any impairment loss recognized will not be material to our results of operations.
in addition to general economic conditions affecting the lodging industry, new hotel room supply is an important factor that can affect the lodging industry's performance and overbuilding has the potential to further exacerbate the negative impact of an economic downturn.  room rates and occupancy, and thus revpar, tend to increase when demand growth exceeds supply growth.  a reduction or slowdown in the growth of lodging demand or increased growth in lodging supply could result in returns that are substantially below expectations or result in losses which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth.
we depend on external sources of capital for future growth; therefore, any disruption to our ability to access capital at times, and on terms reasonably acceptable to us, may affect adversely our business and results of operations.
since we have elected reit status, host inc. must finance its growth and fund debt repayments largely with external sources of capital because it is required to distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its taxable income (other than net capital gain) each year in order to qualify as a reit, including taxable income recognized for federal income tax purposes but with regard to which it does not receive cash. funds used by host inc. to make required distributions are provided by distributions from host l.p. our ability to access external capital could be hampered by a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:
•   price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the u.s. and global equity and credit markets;

•   changes in market perception of our growth potential, including rating agency downgrades by moody's investors service, standard &amp; poor's ratings services or fitch ratings;

•   decreases in our current or estimated future earnings;

•   decreases or fluctuations in the market price of the common stock of host inc.;

•   increases in interest rates; and

•   the terms of our existing indebtedness which, under certain circumstances, restrict our incurrence of debt.

the occurrence of any of these factors, individually or in combination, could prevent us from being able to obtain the external capital we require on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to finance our future growth and on our results of operations and financial condition.  potential consequences of disruptions in u.s. and global equity and credit markets and, as a result, an inability for us to access external capital at times, and on terms, reasonably acceptable to us could include:
•   a need to seek alternative sources of capital with less attractive terms, such as more restrictive covenants and shorter maturity;

•   adverse effects on our financial condition and liquidity, and our ability to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, debt service and capital expenditures;

•   higher costs of capital;

•   an inability to enter into derivative contracts in order to hedge risks associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; or

•   an inability to execute on our acquisition strategy.

we operate in a highly competitive industry.
the lodging industry is highly competitive. our principal competitors are other owners and investors in upper upscale and luxury full-service hotels, including other lodging reits. our hotels face strong competition for individual guests, group reservations and conference business from major hospitality chains with well-established and recognized brands as well as from other smaller hotel chains, independent and local hotel owners and operators. we compete for customers based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation, as well as location, room rates, property size and availability of rooms and conference space, quality of the accommodations, customer satisfaction, amenities and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points. new hotels may be constructed and these additions to supply create new competitors, in some cases without corresponding increases in demand for hotel rooms. our competitors may have similar or greater commercial and financial resources which allow them to improve their properties in ways that affect our ability to compete for guests effectively and adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth.
we also compete for hotel acquisitions with entities that have similar investment objectives as we do. this competition could limit the number of investment opportunities that we find suitable for our business. it also may increase the bargaining power of
17
property owners seeking to sell to us, making it more difficult for us to acquire new properties on attractive terms or on the terms contemplated in our business plan.
there are inherent risks with investments in real estate, including the relative illiquidity of real estate investments.
investments in real estate are inherently illiquid and cannot generally be quickly sold.  for this reason, we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any hotel that we desire to sell for the price or on terms acceptable to us, or the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close on the sale of a hotel. therefore, we may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions and dispose of assets at opportune times or on favorable terms, which may adversely affect our cash flows and our ability to make distributions to stockholders.
in addition, real estate ownership is subject to various risks, including:
•   government regulations relating to real estate ownership or operations, including tax, environmental, zoning and eminent domain laws;

•   loss in value of real estate due to changes in market conditions or the area in which real estate is located;

•   potential civil liability for accidents or other occurrences on owned or leased properties;

•   the ongoing need for owner-funded capital improvements and expenditures to maintain or upgrade properties;

•   periodic total or partial closures due to renovations and facility improvements;

•   changes in tax laws and property taxes, or an increase in the assessed valuation of a property for real estate tax purposes; and

•   force majeure events, such as earthquakes, floods or other possibly uninsured losses.

we have substantial debt and may incur additional debt.
as of december 31, 2017, we and our subsidiaries had total indebtedness of approximately $4.0 billion. our indebtedness requires us to commit a significant portion of our annual cash flow from operations to debt service payments, which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts, dividends and distributions and other general corporate needs. additionally, our substantial indebtedness could:
•   make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;

•   limit our ability in the future to undertake refinancings of our debt or to obtain financing for expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate needs on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all; or

•   affect adversely our ability to compete effectively or operate successfully under adverse economic conditions.

if our cash flow and working capital are not sufficient to fund our expenditures or service our indebtedness, we will be required to raise additional funds through:
•   sales of host l.p.'s op units or host inc.'s common stock;

•   the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness by host l.p.; or

•   sales of our assets.

we cannot make any assurances that any of these sources of funds will be available to us or, if available, will be on terms that we would find acceptable or in amounts sufficient to meet our obligations or fulfill our business plan. under certain circumstances, we would be required to use the cash generated by any or all of the events described above to repay other indebtedness.
the terms of our indebtedness and preferred units place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and these restrictions reduce our operational flexibility and create default risks.
we are, and may in the future become, party to agreements and instruments that place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries.  for instance, the covenants in the documents governing the terms of our senior notes and our credit facility restrict, among other things, our ability to:
•   execute acquisitions, mergers or consolidations, unless the successor entity in such transaction assumes our indebtedness;

•   incur additional debt in excess of certain thresholds and without satisfying certain financial metrics;

•   incur liens securing indebtedness, unless an effective provision is made to secure our other indebtedness by such liens;

18
•   sell assets without using the proceeds from such sales for certain permitted uses or to make an offer to repay or repurchase outstanding indebtedness;

•   pay dividends on classes and series of host inc. capital stock and pay distributions on host l.p.'s classes of units without satisfying certain financial metrics concerning leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage; and

•   conduct transactions with affiliates other than on an arm's length basis and, in certain instances, without obtaining opinions as to the fairness of such transactions.

in addition, certain covenants in our credit facility also require us and our subsidiaries to meet financial metrics. the restrictive covenants in the applicable indenture(s), the credit facility and the documents governing our other debt (including any mortgage debt) will reduce our flexibility in conducting our operations and will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. failure to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our debt. for a detailed description of the covenants and restrictions imposed by the documents governing our indebtedness, see part ii item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-financial condition."
an increase in interest rates would increase the interest costs on our credit facility and on our floating rate debt and could impact adversely our ability to refinance existing debt or sell assets.
interest payments for borrowings on our credit facility and the mortgages on certain non-consolidated properties are based on floating rates. as a result, an increase in interest rates will reduce our cash flow available for other corporate purposes, including investments in our portfolio. as of december 31, 2017, approximately 30% of our debt is subject to floating interest rates.
rising interest rates also could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures and increase interest costs on any debt that is refinanced. we may from time to time enter into agreements such as interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate hedging contracts. currently, the majority of our mortgages with floating rates, including mortgages on our joint venture properties, are fully or partially hedged through the use of floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps or interest rate caps. these agreements expose us to the risk that other parties to the agreements will not perform or that the agreements will be unenforceable. in addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to dispose of assets as part of our business strategy.
our expenses may not decrease if our revenue decreases.
many of the expenses associated with owning and operating hotels, such as debt-service payments, property taxes, insurance, utilities, and employee wages and benefits, are relatively inflexible. they do not necessarily decrease directly with a reduction in revenue at the hotels and may be subject to increases that are not tied to the performance of our hotels or the increase in the rate of inflation generally. also, as of december 31, 2017, 26 of our hotels are subject to third-party ground leases, which generally require periodic increases in ground rent payments. our ability to pay these rents could be affected adversely if our hotel revenues do not increase at the same or a greater rate than the increases in rental payments under the ground leases. for further information on our ground leases, please see exhibit 99.1 filed with this report.
additionally, certain costs, such as wages, benefits and insurance, may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period. in the event of a significant decrease in demand, our hotel managers may not be able to reduce the size of hotel work forces in order to decrease wages and benefits. our managers also may be unable to offset any fixed or increased expenses with higher room rates. any of our efforts to reduce operating costs also could adversely affect the future growth of our business and the value of our hotel properties.
our acquisition of additional properties and disposition of certain properties may have a significant effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations.
we may acquire properties through various structures, including transactions involving portfolios, single assets, joint ventures and acquisitions of all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits or similar real estate ownership entities. we anticipate that our acquisitions will be financed with a combination of methods and a variety of sources of external capital, including proceeds from host inc. equity offerings, issuance of limited partnership interests of host l.p., advances under our credit facility, the incurrence or assumption of indebtedness and proceeds from the sale of assets. our inability to access external sources of capital may limit our ability to finance acquisitions. for a discussion of factors that may limit our access to sources of capital, see "-we depend on external sources of capital for future growth; therefore, any disruption to our ability to access capital at times, and on terms reasonably acceptable to us, may affect adversely our business and results of operations."  in addition, certain of these factors, such as disruption in the global capital markets, may limit the ability of purchasers to finance their acquisition of our hotels and therefore our ability to use disposition proceeds to finance our acquisitions.
19
we routinely are actively engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing and negotiating possible acquisition transactions. we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from such acquisitions. our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions could have a significant adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations. these adverse effects may occur because the performance of the property does not support the additional indebtedness and related interest expense that we incurred as a result of the acquisition. in addition, assets and entities that we have acquired, or may in the future acquire, may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have no recourse, or only limited recourse, against the sellers.  in general, the representations and warranties provided in the transaction agreements may not survive long enough for us to become aware of such liabilities and to seek recourse against our sellers and indemnification covering representations and warranties often is limited and subject to various materiality thresholds, a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses. as a result, there is no guarantee that we will recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of their representations and warranties. the total amount of costs and expenses that may be incurred with respect to liabilities associated with acquired hotels and entities may exceed our expectations, plus we may experience other unanticipated adverse effects, all of which may affect adversely our revenues, expenses, operating results and financial condition. finally, indemnification agreements between us and the sellers typically provide that the sellers will retain certain specified liabilities relating to the assets and entities acquired by us. while the sellers generally are contractually obligated to pay all losses and other expenses relating to such retained liabilities without regard to survival limitations, materiality thresholds, deductibles or caps on losses, there can be no guarantee that such arrangements will not require us to incur losses or other expenses in addition to those incurred by the sellers.
we also are actively engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing and negotiating possible transactions for disposing of certain of our hotel properties. under current market conditions, based on our experience, we expect that any future sale of our hotel properties may be effected through any of several structures, including sale transactions involving portfolios or single assets, joint ventures with third parties and spin-off distributions of hotel properties to our security holders. we anticipate that any potential purchaser of our hotel properties may finance its purchase through a combination of methods, including cash or the issuance to us of its securities or those of one of its affiliates. therefore, to maximize the value of hotel properties that we may in the future decide to dispose of, we may consider a range of transaction structures that we determine under the circumstances are in our best interest.  we cannot provide any assurances that we will successfully conclude any transaction to dispose of any one or more of our properties or that the terms of any such transaction will maximize the value of hotel properties being sold.
we may not achieve the value we anticipate from new hotel developments or value enhancement projects at our existing hotels.
we currently are, and in the future may be, involved in the development or redevelopment of hotel properties, timeshare units or other alternate uses of portions of our existing properties, including the development of retail, office or apartments, including through joint ventures. there are risks inherent in any new development, including:
•   we may not obtain the zoning, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations necessary to complete the development. a delay in receiving these approvals could affect adversely the returns we expect to receive.

•   any new construction involves the possibility of construction delays and cost overruns that may increase project costs.

•   defects in design or construction may result in delays and additional costs to remedy the defect or require a portion of a property to be closed during the period required to rectify the defect.

•   we may not be able to meet the loan covenants in any financing obtained to fund the new development, creating default risks.

•   natural or manmade disasters may delay construction or increase construction costs.

•   risks related to change in economic and market conditions between development commencement and stabilization.

•   the development of timeshare units could become less attractive due to decreases in demand for residential, fractional or interval ownership, increases in mortgage rates and/or decreases in mortgage availability, market absorption or oversupply, with the result that we may not be able to sell the timeshare units for a profit or at the prices or selling pace we initially anticipated.

in addition, to the extent that developments are conducted through joint ventures, this creates additional risks, including the possibility that our partners may not meet their financial obligations or will develop business interests, policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours. see "-we may acquire hotel properties through joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts."
any of the above factors could affect adversely our and our partners' ability to complete the developments on schedule and consistent with the scope that currently is contemplated, or to achieve the intended value of these projects. for these reasons, there can be no assurances as to the value to be realized by us from these transactions or any future similar transactions.
20
we do not control our hotel operations and we are dependent on the managers of our hotels.
to maintain our status as a reit, we are not permitted to operate or manage any of our hotels. as a result, we, through our trss, have entered into management agreements with third-party managers to operate our hotel properties. for this reason, we are unable to directly implement strategic business decisions with respect to the daily operation and marketing of our hotels, such as decisions with respect to the setting of room rates, food and beverage pricing and certain similar matters. although we consult with our hotel operators with respect to strategic business plans, the hotel operators are under no obligation to implement any of our recommendations with respect to these matters. while we monitor the hotel managers' performance, we have limited recourse under our management agreements if we believe that the hotel managers are not performing adequately. the cash flow from our hotels may be affected adversely if our managers fail to provide quality services and amenities or if they or their affiliates fail to maintain a quality brand name.  because our management agreements are long-term in nature, we also may not be able to terminate these agreements if we believe the manager is not performing adequately.
from time to time, we have had, and continue to have, differences with the managers of our hotels over their performance and compliance with the terms of our management agreements. we generally resolve issues with our managers through discussions and negotiations. however, if we are unable to reach satisfactory results through discussions and negotiations, we may choose to litigate the dispute or submit the matter to third-party dispute resolution. failure by our hotel managers to fully perform the duties agreed to in our management agreements or the failure of our managers to adequately manage the risks associated with hotel operations could affect adversely our results of operations.
in addition, our hotel managers or their affiliates manage, and in some cases own, have invested in, or provided credit support or operating guarantees, to hotels that compete with our hotels, all of which may result in conflicts of interest. as a result, our hotel managers have in the past made, and may in the future make, decisions regarding competing lodging facilities that are not or would not be in our best interest.
furthermore, our management agreements for our brand managed properties generally have provisions that can restrict our ability to sell, lease or otherwise transfer our hotels, unless the transferee is not a competitor of the manager and the transferee assumes the related management agreements and meets specified other conditions. our ability to finance or sell our properties, depending upon the structure of such transactions, may require the manager's consent. similarly, decisions with respect to the repositioning of a hotel, such as the outsourcing of food and beverage outlets, may require the manager's consent.
the properties managed by marriott international account for most of our revenues and operating income. adverse developments in marriott's business and affairs or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us.
on september 23, 2016, marriott international completed its acquisition of starwood hotels and resorts worldwide, bringing starwood's brands under marriott's management. as a result of the merger, approximately 78% of our properties (as measured by 2017 revenues) now are managed or franchised by marriott. we rely on marriott's personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage and maintain our hotel operations efficiently, effectively, profitably and in compliance with the terms, responsibilities and duties of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations. any adverse developments in marriott's business and affairs or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties and could have a material adverse effect on us. in addition, the integration of starwood's brands under marriott management may expose us to additional risks and costs at our properties, and will place a significant burden on marriott's management and internal resources and the potential for diversion of its attention from the day-to-day business operations of its hotels, including hotels owned by us.
we are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel, particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor.
our third-party managers are responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels. although we do not directly employ or manage employees at our consolidated hotels (other than employing, but not managing or supervising, the employees at our properties in brazil), we still remain subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force, particularly at those hotels with unionized labor. from time to time, hotel operations may be disrupted as a result of strikes, lockouts, public demonstrations or other negative actions and publicity. we also may incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of contract disputes involving our third-party managers and their labor force or other events. the resolution of labor disputes or re-negotiated labor contracts could lead to increased labor costs, a significant component of our hotel operating costs, either by increases in wages or benefits or by changes in work rules that raise hotel operating costs. as we are not the employer nor bound by any collective bargaining agreement, we do not negotiate with any labor organization, and it is the responsibility of each property's manager to enter into such labor contracts. our ability, if any, to have any meaningful impact on the outcome of these negotiations is restricted by and dependent on the individual management agreement covering a specific property and we may have little ability to control the outcome of these negotiations.
21
our hotels have an ongoing need for renovations and potentially significant capital expenditures in order to remain competitive in the marketplace, maintain brand standards or to comply with applicable laws or regulations. the timing and costs of such renovations or improvements may result in reduced operating performance during construction and may not improve the return on these investments.
we are required by our loan agreements or agreements with our hotel managers to make agreed upon capital expenditures. in addition, we will need to make further capital expenditures in order to remain competitive with other hotels, to maintain the economic value of our hotels and to comply with applicable laws and regulations. the timing of these improvements can affect hotel performance, particularly if the improvements require closure of a significant number of rooms or other features of the hotels, such as ballrooms, meeting space and restaurants. these capital improvements reduce the availability of cash for other purposes and are subject to cost overruns and delays. in addition, because we depend on external sources of capital, we may not have the necessary funds to invest and, if we fail to maintain our properties in accordance with brand standards set by our managers, they may terminate the management agreement. moreover, we may not necessarily realize a significant, or any, improvement in the performance of the hotels at which we make these investments.
our hotels are geographically concentrated in a limited number of large urban cities and, accordingly, we could be disproportionately harmed by adverse changes to these markets, a natural disaster or threat of a terrorist attack.
the concentration of our hotels in a limited number of large urban cities exposes us to greater risk to local economic or business conditions, changes in hotel supply in these cities, and other conditions than more geographically diversified hotel companies. hotels in new york, washington, d.c., san diego, san francisco, boston, florida, hawaii, atlanta, and los angeles represented approximately 74% of our 2017 revenues. an economic downturn, an increase in hotel supply in these cities, a natural disaster, a terrorist attack or similar disaster in any one of these cities likely would cause a decline in the hotel market and adversely affect occupancy rates, the financial performance of our hotels in these cities and our overall results of operations. for example, in september 2017, our operations in florida and houston were impacted negatively by hurricanes irma and harvey. in 2013, decreased u.s. government demand for hotel rooms (approximately 5% of our business) in markets such as washington, d.c. had a negative impact on our results of operations.
the threat of terrorism also may negatively impact hotel occupancy and average daily rate, due to resulting disruptions in business and leisure travel patterns and concerns about travel safety. hotels in major metropolitan areas, such as the major cities that represent our largest markets, may be particularly adversely affected due to concerns about travel safety. the possibility of future attacks may hamper business and leisure travel patterns and, accordingly, the performance of our business and our operations.
the ownership of hotels outside the united states will expose us to risks related to owning hotels in those international markets.
as of december 31, 2017, we own directly six hotels located outside of the united states. we also are party to a joint venture that owns 11 hotels in europe and to a joint venture that owns a non-controlling interest in seven hotels in india. we may have difficulty managing entry into new geographic markets where we have limited knowledge and understanding of the local economy, an absence of business relationships in the area, or unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures and regulations. there are risks inherent in conducting business outside of the united states, which include:
•   risks of non-compliance with varied and unfamiliar employment laws and practices;

•   tax laws, which may provide for corporate income or other taxes or tax rates that exceed those of the u.s. and which may provide that foreign earnings that are repatriated, directly or indirectly, are subject to dividend withholding tax requirements or other restrictions and which may affect our ability to repatriate non-u.s. earnings in a tax efficient manner;

•   compliance with and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or monetary policy;

•   the willingness of domestic or international lenders to provide financing and changes in the availability, cost and terms of such financing;

•   rapid adverse changes in local, political, economic and market conditions;

•   the ability to obtain insurance coverage related to terrorist events;

•   changes of interest rates and/or currency exchange rates and hyperinflation or deflation and difficulties in hedging these risks;

•   regulations regarding the incurrence of debt;

•   difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries; and

•   difficulties in complying with u.s. rules governing reits while operating outside of the united states.

22
any of these factors could affect adversely our ability to obtain all of the intended benefits of our international operations. if we do not effectively manage and successfully integrate the international hotels into our organization, our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.
we may acquire hotel properties through joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts.
we have made investments in joint ventures and are exploring further investment opportunities. we may, from time to time, invest as a co-venturer in other entities holding hotel properties instead of purchasing them directly. we also may sell interests in existing properties to a third party as part of forming a joint venture with the third party. investments in joint ventures may involve risks not present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners or co-venturers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. co-venturers often share control over the operation of a joint venture. actions by a co-venturer also could subject the assets to additional risks as a result of any of the following circumstances:
•   our co-venturer might have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our, or the joint venture's, interests or goals; or

•   our co-venturer may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests, or contrary to our policies or objectives.

for certain joint ventures, we might not be able to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners. disputes between us and our partners or co-venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and may negatively impact operations.
although our joint ventures may generate positive cash flow, in some cases they may be unable to distribute cash flow to the joint venture partners due to tax laws or other restrictions on our ability to repatriate non-u.s. earnings in a tax efficient manner.  additionally, in some cases our joint venture partners share control over distributions and may choose to retain capital in the joint venture rather than to distribute it. because our ability to generate liquidity from our joint ventures depends in part on their ability to distribute capital to us, our failure to receive distributions from our joint ventures could reduce our cash flow return on these investments.
the growth of internet reservation channels could adversely affect our business.
a significant percentage of hotel rooms for individual or "transient" customers are booked through internet travel intermediaries. search engines and peer-to-peer inventory sources also provide online travel services that compete with our hotels. if bookings shift to higher cost distribution channels, including these internet travel intermediaries, it could materially impact our revenues and profitability. additionally, as intermediary bookings increase, they may be able to obtain higher commissions, reduced room rates or other significant contract concessions from the brands and hotel management companies operating our hotels. also, although internet travel intermediaries traditionally have competed to attract transient business rather than group and convention business, in recent years they have expanded their business to include marketing to large group and convention business. if that growth continues, it could both divert group and convention business away from our hotels and also increase our cost of sales for group and convention business. consolidation of internet travel intermediaries, and the entry of major internet companies into the internet travel bookings business, also could divert bookings away from the websites of our hotel managers and increase our cost of sales.
full insurance recovery for terrorist acts may not be possible.
we generally obtain terrorism insurance to cover property damage caused by acts of terrorism under separate standalone policies of insurance as well as policies on u.s. properties which currently are subject to u.s. federal government cost sharing as provided in the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act ("tripra"), which has been extended through december 31, 2020. we also have terrorism insurance under our general liability program and in our program for directors' and officers' coverage. we also obtain terrorism insurance to cover some of our foreign properties through insurance programs involving or administered by foreign governments. we may not be able to recover fully under our existing terrorism insurance policies for losses caused by some types of terrorist acts, and neither u.s. nor foreign terrorism insurance legislation or regulations ensure that we will be able to obtain terrorism insurance in adequate amounts or at acceptable premium levels in the future.
tripra distinguishes between "direct insurers" (those which write policies directly insuring commercial businesses) and "reinsurers" (those which issue policies to direct insurers, absorbing some of the risk in the direct insurers' policies). tripra requires direct insurers to offer terrorism insurance, except for nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological ("nbcr") perils and most direct insurers have been unwilling to provide nbcr coverage, even with government reimbursement. tripra does not require reinsurers to provide any terrorism coverage. any damage related to war and to nbcr incidents, therefore, is excluded under policies covering

our u.s. properties. moreover, many of our foreign properties also are not covered against nbcr perils. we obtain a certain amount of property insurance coverage on our u.s. properties for nbcr perils through our wholly-owned subsidiary that acts as our direct insurer against such perils to the extent of reimbursement under tripra. we ultimately are responsible for any loss borne by our insurance subsidiary.
as a result of the above, there remains uncertainty regarding the adequacy and cost of terrorism coverage that will be available to protect our interests in the event of terrorist attacks that impact our properties.
some potential losses are not covered by insurance.
we, or our hotel managers, carry comprehensive insurance coverage for general liability, property, business interruption and other risks with respect to all of our hotels and other properties. these policies offer coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary for similar types of properties. generally, our "all-risk" property policies provide coverage that is available on a per-occurrence basis and that, for each occurrence, has an overall limit, as well as various sub-limits, on the amount of insurance proceeds we can receive. sub-limits exist for certain types of claims, such as service interruption, debris removal, expediting costs, landscaping replacement and natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods and hurricanes, and may be subject to annual aggregate coverage limits. the dollar amounts of these sub-limits are significantly lower than the dollar amounts of the overall coverage limit. in this regard, hotels in certain of our markets, including california, florida and seattle, have in the past been and continue to be particularly susceptible to damage from natural disasters. recovery under the applicable policies also is subject to substantial deductibles and complex calculations of lost business income. there is no assurance that this insurance, where maintained, will fully fund the re-building or restoration of a hotel that is impacted by an earthquake, hurricane, or other natural disaster, or the income lost as a result of the damage. our property policies also provide that all of the claims from each of our properties resulting from a particular insurable event must be combined for purposes of evaluating whether the aggregate limits and sub-limits contained in our policies have been exceeded and, in the case where the manager of one of our hotels provides this coverage, any such claims will be combined with the claims of other owners participating in the manager's program for the same purpose. therefore, if an insurable event occurs that affects more than one of our hotels, or, in the case of hotels where coverage is provided by the manager, affects hotels owned by others, the claims from each affected hotel will be added together to determine whether the aggregate limit or sub-limits, depending on the type of claim, have been reached. each affected hotel only may receive a proportional share of the amount of insurance proceeds provided for under the policy if the total value of the loss exceeds the aggregate limits available. we may incur losses in excess of insured limits and, as a result, we may be even less likely to receive complete coverage for risks that affect multiple properties, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, or certain types of terrorism.
in addition, there are other risks, such as certain environmental hazards, that may be deemed to fall completely outside the general coverage limits of our policies or may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify coverage. we also may encounter challenges with an insurance provider regarding whether it will pay a particular claim that we believe to be covered under our policy. should a loss in excess of insured limits or an uninsured loss occur, or should we be unsuccessful in obtaining coverage from an insurance carrier, we could lose all or a part of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the hotel. in that event, we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property.
cyber threats and the risk of data breaches or disruptions of our managers' or our own information technology systems could materially adversely affect our business.
our third party hotel managers are dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to access, process, transmit and store proprietary and customer information. these complex networks include reservation systems, vacation exchange systems, hotel management systems, customer databases, call centers, administrative systems, and third party vendor systems. these systems require the collection and retention of large volumes of personally identifiable information of hotel guests, including credit card numbers. our hotel managers may store and process such proprietary and customer information both on systems located at the hotels we own and other hotels that they operate, their corporate locations and at third-party owned facilities, including, for example, in a third-party hosted cloud environment. these information networks and systems can be vulnerable to threats such as system, network or internet failures; computer hacking or business disruption; cyber-terrorism; viruses, worms or other malicious software programs; and employee error, negligence or fraud. these threats can be introduced in any number of ways, including through third parties accessing our hotel managers' information networks and systems. the risks from these cyber threats are significant. we rely on the security systems of our managers to protect proprietary and customer information from these threats. any compromise of our managers' networks could result in a disruption to operations, such as disruptions in fulfilling guest reservations, delayed bookings or sales, or lost guest reservations. any of these events could, in turn, result in disruption of the operations of the hotels we own that are managed by them, in increased costs and in potential litigation and liability. all of our major hotel management companies and a majority of our third party operators maintain insurance against cyber threats. however, these policies provide varying limits and may be subject to sub limits for certain types of claims, and it is not expected that these policies will provide a total recovery of all potential losses. in addition, public disclosure, or loss of customer or proprietary information, could result in damage to
24
the manager's reputation and a loss of confidence among hotel guests and result in reputational harm for the hotels owned by us and managed by them, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition to the information technologies and systems of our managers used to operate our hotels, we have our own corporate technologies and systems that are used to access, store, transmit, and manage or support a variety of business processes. there can be no assurance that the security measures we have taken to protect the contents of these systems will prevent failures, inadequacies or interruptions in system services or that system security will not be breached through physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, and attacks by hackers. disruptions in service, system shutdowns and security breaches in the information technologies and systems we use, including unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, could have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial reporting and compliance, and subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties which could be significant. while we have our own cyber insurance policy to address these exposures, we do not expect it will cover all losses that we could experience from these exposures.
litigation judgments or settlements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition.
we are involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business and are vigorously defending these claims; however, no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings. we believe, based on currently available information, that the results of such proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, but might be material to our operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period. we also could become the subject of future claims by the operators of our hotels, individuals or companies who use our hotels, our investors, our joint venture partners or regulating entities and these claims could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and performance.
we depend on our key personnel.
our continued success depends on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and other key personnel. none of our key personnel have employment agreements and we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our executive officers. these individuals are important to our business and strategy and to the extent that any of them departs and is not replaced with a qualified substitute, such person's departure could harm our operations and financial condition.
exchange rate fluctuations could affect adversely our financial results.
currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect our results of operations and financial position. we generate revenue and expenses in such foreign currencies as the euro, the canadian dollar, the mexican peso, the british pound sterling, the swedish krona, the brazilian real and the indian rupee. although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions and/or obtain local currency mortgage debt in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of these and other foreign currencies, these transactions, if entered into, will not eliminate entirely that risk. to the extent that we are unable to match revenue received in foreign currencies with expenses paid in that same currency, exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. additionally, because our consolidated financial results are reported in u.s. dollars, if we generate revenues or earnings in other currencies, the conversion of such amounts to u.s. dollars can result in an increase or decrease of the amount of our revenues or earnings as a result of exchange rate fluctuations.
similarly, changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar can result in increases or decreases in demand at our u.s. properties from international travelers coming to the united states. because of the concentration of our hotels in major u.s. cities, we may have more exposure to fluctuations in international travel to the united states than other lodging companies without investments located as heavily in these markets.
applicable reit laws may restrict certain business activities.
as a reit, each of host inc. and its subsidiary reit is subject to various restrictions on the types of income it can earn, assets it can own and activities in which it can engage. business activities that could be restricted by applicable reit laws include, but are not limited to, developing alternative uses of real estate and the ownership of hotels that are not leased to a trs, including the development and/or sale of timeshare or condominium units or the related land parcels. due to these restrictions, we anticipate that we will continue to conduct certain business activities, including, but not limited to, those mentioned above, in one or more of our trss. our trss are taxable as regular c corporations and are subject to federal, state, local, and, if applicable, foreign taxation on their taxable income.
25
environmental problems are possible and can be costly.
our properties are subject to requirements and potential liabilities under various foreign and u.s. federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations. unidentified environmental liabilities could arise and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and performance. additionally, even after we have sold a property, we may be liable for environmental liabilities that occurred during our ownership. federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and remediate hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property. the owner or operator may be required to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage, and for investigation and remediation costs incurred by the parties in connection with the contamination. these laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs incurred. in addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site. environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of toxic or hazardous substances. these laws require that owners or operators of buildings properly manage and maintain these substances and notify and train those who may come into contact with them and undertake special precautions. these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to toxic or hazardous materials.
we face possible risks associated with natural disasters and the physical effects of climate change.
we are subject to the risks associated with natural disasters and the physical effects of climate change, which can include more frequent or severe storms, droughts, hurricanes and flooding, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations and business. to the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns, our coastal markets also could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea-levels causing damage to our properties. as a result, we could become subject to significant losses and/or repair costs that may or may not be fully covered by insurance. other markets may experience prolonged variations in temperature or precipitation that may limit access to the water needed to operate our hotels or significantly increase energy costs, which may subject those properties to additional regulatory burdens, such as limitations on water usage or stricter energy efficiency standards.  climate change also may affect our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable in areas most vulnerable to such events, increasing operating costs at our properties, such as the cost of water or energy, and requiring us to expend funds as we seek to repair and protect our properties against such risks. there can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations or business.
compliance with other government regulations can be costly.
our hotels are subject to various other forms of regulation, including title iii of the americans with disabilities act ("ada"), building codes and regulations pertaining to fire and life safety. under the ada, all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal rules related to access and use by disabled persons. these laws and regulations may be changed from time-to-time, or new regulations adopted, resulting in additional costs of compliance, including potential litigation. a determination that we are not in compliance with the ada or other laws and regulations could result in a court order to bring the hotel into compliance, imposition of civil penalties in cases brought by the justice department, or an award of attorneys' fees to private litigants. compliance with the ada and other laws and regulations could require substantial capital expenditures. any increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
in addition, the operations of our international properties are subject to a variety of united states and international laws and regulations, including the united states foreign corrupt practices act ("fcpa"). we have policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with the fcpa and other anti-corruption laws, but we cannot assure that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with, or be able to detect violations of, any such laws or regulations. in addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international properties might be subject and the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.
risks of ownership of host inc.'s common stock there are limitations on the acquisition of host inc. common stock and changes in control.
host inc.'s charter and by-laws, the partnership agreement of host l.p., and the maryland general corporation law (the "mgcl") contain a number of provisions, the exercise or existence of which could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for host inc.'s stockholders or host l.p.'s unitholders, including the following:
•   restrictions on transfer and ownership of host inc.'s stock. to maintain host inc.'s qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of host inc.'s outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned in the

26
last half of the taxable year, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals, which, as defined in the code, may include certain entities. accordingly, host inc.'s charter prohibits ownership, directly or by attribution, by any person or persons acting as a group, of more than 9.8% in value or number, whichever is more restrictive, of shares of host inc.'s outstanding common stock, preferred stock or any other class or series of stock, each considered as a separate class or series for this purpose. together, these limitations are referred to as the "ownership limit."

stock acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred automatically to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary, and the intended acquirer of the stock in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any distributions thereon, to vote those shares of stock or to receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the stock in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the stock or the amount realized from the sale. a transfer of shares of host inc.'s stock to a person who, as a result of the transfer, violates the ownership limit may be void under certain circumstances, and, in any event, would deny that person any of the economic benefits of owning shares of host inc.'s stock in excess of the ownership limit. these restrictions will not apply if host inc.'s board of directors determines that it no longer is in host inc.'s best interests to continue to qualify as a reit or that compliance with the restrictions on transfer and ownership no longer is required for host inc. to qualify as a reit.
•   removal of members of the board of directors. host inc.'s charter provides that, except for any directors who may be elected by holders of a class or series of shares of capital stock other than common stock, directors may be removed only for cause and by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors. vacancies on host inc.'s board of directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of the remaining directors, except that a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority vote of the entire board of directors. any vacancy resulting from the removal of a director by the stockholders may be filled by the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors.

•   preferred shares; classification or reclassification of unissued shares of capital stock without stockholder approval. host inc.'s charter provides that the total number of shares of stock of all classes that host inc. has authority to issue is 1,100,000,000, consisting of 1,050,000,000 shares of common stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. host inc.'s board of directors has the authority, without a vote of stockholders, to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of stock into other classes or series of stock, and to establish the terms, preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption for each class or series. because host inc.'s board of directors has this power, it may give the holders of any class or series of stock terms, preferences, powers and rights, including voting rights, senior to the rights of holders of existing stock.

•   certain provisions of maryland law may limit the ability of a third-party to acquire control of host inc. certain provisions of the mgcl may have the effect of inhibiting a third-party from acquiring host inc., including:

o   "business combination" provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between a corporation and an "interested stockholder" (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's then outstanding shares of voting stock or an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the then outstanding stock of the corporation) or an affiliate of any interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter imposes two super-majority stockholder voting requirements on these combinations; and

o   "control share" provisions that provide that holders of "control shares" of a corporation (defined as voting shares of stock that, if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned or controlled by the acquirer, would entitle the acquirer to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a "control share acquisition" (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of issued and outstanding "control shares") have no voting rights except to the extent approved by the stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares.

host inc. is subject to the maryland business combination statute. our bylaws contain a provision exempting us from the control share provisions of the mgcl. there can be no assurance that this bylaw provision exempting us from the control share provisions will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future.

•   merger, consolidation, share exchange and transfer of host inc.'s assets. under maryland law and host inc.'s charter, subject to the terms of any outstanding class or series of capital stock, we can merge with or into another entity, convert, consolidate with one or more other entities, participate in a share exchange or transfer host inc.'s assets within the meaning of the mgcl if approved (1) by host inc.'s board of directors in the manner provided in the mgcl, and (2) by host inc.'s stockholders holding two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, except that any merger of host inc. with or into a trust organized for the purpose of changing host inc.'s form of organization from a corporation to a trust requires only the approval of host inc.'s stockholders holding a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the merger. under the mgcl, specified mergers may be approved without a vote of stockholders and a share exchange only is required

27
to be approved by the board of directors of a maryland corporation if the corporation is the successor entity. host inc.'s voluntary dissolution also would require approval of stockholders holding two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.

•   certain charter amendments. host inc.'s charter contains provisions relating to restrictions on transfer and ownership of host inc.'s stock, fixing the size of the board of directors within the range set forth in the charter, removal of directors, the filling of vacancies, exculpation and indemnification of directors, calling special stockholder meetings and others, all of which may be amended only by a resolution adopted by the board of directors and approved by host inc.'s stockholders holding two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. other charter amendments generally require approval of the board and the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. these provisions may make it more difficult to amend host inc.'s charter to alter the provisions described herein that could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control or the acquisition of host inc. common stock, without the approval of the board of directors.

shares of host inc.'s common stock that are or become available for sale could affect the share price of host inc.'s common stock.
we have in the past issued and may in the future issue additional shares of common stock to raise the capital necessary to finance hotel acquisitions, fund capital expenditures, refinance debt or for other corporate purposes. sales of a substantial number of shares of host inc.'s common stock, or the perception that sales could occur, could affect adversely prevailing market prices for host inc.'s common stock. in addition, holders of op units who redeem their units and receive, at host inc.'s election, shares of host inc. common stock will be able to sell those shares freely. as of december 31, 2017, there are approximately 8.2 million host lp op units outstanding that are owned by third parties and are redeemable, which represents approximately 1% of all outstanding units. further, a substantial number of shares of host inc.'s common stock have been and will be issued or reserved for issuance from time to time under our employee benefit plans. as of december 31, 2017, we maintain two stock-based compensation plans: (i) the comprehensive stock plan, whereby we may award to participating employees and directors restricted units or shares of common stock, options to purchase common stock and deferred shares of common stock, and (ii) an employee stock purchase plan. at december 31, 2017, there were approximately 14 million shares of host inc.'s common stock reserved and available for issuance under the comprehensive stock plan and employee stock purchase plan and 0.6 million outstanding options exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $18.98 per share.
our earnings and cash distributions will affect the market price of shares of host inc.'s common stock.
we believe that the market value of a reit's equity securities is based primarily upon the market's perception of the reit's growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions, whether from operations, sales, acquisitions, development or refinancings, and secondarily is based upon the value of the underlying assets. for that reason, shares of host inc.'s common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than its net asset value per share. to the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves or other purposes, rather than distributing the cash flow to stockholders, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may impact negatively the market price of host inc.'s common stock. our failure to meet the market's expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions likely would affect adversely the market price of host inc.'s common stock.
federal income tax risks adverse tax consequences would occur if host inc. or its subsidiary reit fails to qualify as a reit.
we believe that host inc. has been organized and has operated in such a manner as to qualify as a reit under the code, commencing with its taxable year beginning january 1, 1999, and host inc. currently intends to continue to operate as a reit during future years. in addition, host inc. owns, through host l.p., one entity that has elected to be treated as a reit. as the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit are extremely complex and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification and taxation as a reit are limited, no assurance can be provided that host inc. currently qualifies as a reit or will continue to qualify as a reit or that host inc.'s subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit or will continue to qualify as a reit. if our subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit, it is possible that host inc. would fail to qualify as a reit unless it (or the subsidiary reit) could avail itself of certain relief provisions. if host inc. or its subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit, and any available relief provisions did not apply, the non-qualifying reit would not be allowed to take a deduction for distributions to its stockholders in computing its taxable income, and it would be subject to federal and state corporate income tax on its taxable income. any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the non-qualifying reit's cash available for, among other things, operations and distributions to its stockholders. in addition, if host inc. were to fail to qualify as a reit, it would not be required to make distributions to its stockholders. moreover, unless entitled to statutory relief, the non-qualifying reit could not qualify as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which reit qualification was lost.
28
to qualify as a reit, host inc. is required to satisfy the requirements of several asset and gross income tests. our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which assets are not susceptible to a precise determination of fair market value, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. our compliance with the reit asset and gross income test requirements also depends upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our gross income and assets on an ongoing basis. accordingly, there can be no assurance that the u.s. internal revenue service (the "irs") will not contend that our hotel leases, interests in subsidiaries, or interests in the securities of other issuers will not cause a violation of the reit gross income and asset test requirements.
any determination that host inc. or its subsidiary reit does not qualify as a reit will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could reduce materially the value of host inc.'s common stock. the additional tax liability of host inc. or the subsidiary reit for the year, or years, in which the relevant entity does not qualify as a reit would reduce its cash flow available for investment, debt service or distributions to stockholders. furthermore, the entity not qualifying as a reit no longer would be required to make distributions to its stockholders as a condition to reit qualification, and any distributions made to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary c corporation dividends to the extent of its current and accumulated earnings and profits. this means that, if host inc. were to fail to qualify as a reit, host inc.'s stockholders currently taxed as individuals would be taxed on dividends at capital gain tax rates and host inc.'s corporate stockholders generally would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends, subject in each case to applicable limitations under the code. host inc.'s failure to qualify as a reit also would cause an event of default under host l.p.'s credit facility, which default could lead to an acceleration of the amounts due thereunder, which, in turn, would constitute an event of default under host l.p.'s outstanding debt securities.
if our hotel managers do not qualify as "eligible independent contractors," or if our hotels are not "qualified lodging facilities," host inc. will fail to qualify as a reit.
each hotel with respect to which our trs pays rent must be a "qualified lodging facility." a "qualified lodging facility" is a hotel, motel, or other establishment more than one-half of the dwelling units in which are used on a transient basis, including customary amenities and facilities, provided that no wagering activities are conducted at or in connection with such facility by any person who is engaged in the business of accepting wagers and who legally is authorized to engage in such business at or in connection with such facility. we believe that all of the hotels leased to our trs are qualified lodging facilities. however, the reit provisions of the code provide only limited guidance for making determinations of whether a hotel is considered a qualified lodging facility, and there can be no assurance that our hotels will be so considered in all cases.
if our hotel managers do not qualify as "eligible independent contractors," host inc. and our subsidiary reit likely will fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes. each of the hotel management companies that enters into a management contract with our trs must qualify as an "eligible independent contractor" under the reit rules in order for the rent paid to host inc. and its subsidiary reit by our trs to be qualifying gross income for the reit gross income test requirements. among other requirements, in order to qualify as an eligible independent contractor, a hotel manager cannot own more than 35% of our outstanding shares (by value) and no person or group of persons can own more than 35% of our outstanding shares and the ownership interests of the hotel manager, taking into account only owners of more than 5% of our shares and, with respect to ownership interests in such hotel managers that are publicly traded, only owners of more than 5% of such ownership interests. complex ownership attribution rules apply for purposes of these 35% ownership thresholds. although we monitor ownership of our shares by our hotel managers and their owners, and certain provisions of our charter are designed to prevent ownership of our shares in violation of these rules, there can be no assurance that these ownership limits will not be exceeded.
the size of our trs is limited and our transactions with our trs will cause us to be subject to a 100% excise tax on certain income or deductions if such transactions are not conducted on arm's-length terms.
a reit may own up to 100% of the equity interests of an entity that is a c corporation for federal income tax purposes if the entity is a trs. a trs may own assets and earn gross income that would not be considered as qualifying assets or as qualifying gross income if owned or earned directly by a reit, including gross operating income from hotel operations. both the reit and its c corporation subsidiary must jointly elect to treat such c corporation subsidiary as a trs. a c corporation of which a trs directly or indirectly owns more than 35% of the voting power or value of its stock or securities automatically will be treated as a trs. overall, for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017, no more than 20% (25% for taxable years beginning after july 30, 2008 and on or before december 31, 2017) of the value of a reit's assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more trs. beginning in 2018, a trs may be eligible to elect out of new interest expense limitation rules enacted in december 2017 by the tax cuts and jobs act.
our trs will pay federal corporate income tax and applicable state and local corporate income tax and, if applicable, foreign corporate income tax on its taxable income. the tax cuts and jobs act reduces the u.s. statuary corporate income tax rate from a maximum rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21% effective january 1, 2018. its after-tax net income will be available for distribution to us, but it is not required to be so distributed. we believe that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of our trs has been and will
29
continue to be less than 20% (25% for taxable years beginning after july 30, 2008 and on or before december 31, 2017) of the value of our total assets (including our trs stock and securities). furthermore, we monitor the value of our investments in our trs for the purpose of ensuring compliance with trs ownership limitations. there can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the 20% (25% for taxable years beginning after july 30, 2008 and on or before december 31, 2017) value limitation discussed above.
rent paid to host inc. and its subsidiary reit by our trs cannot be based on net income or profits in order for such rents to qualify as "rent from real property." we receive "percentage rent" from our trs that is calculated based on the gross revenues of the hotels subject to leases - not on net income or profits. if the irs determines that the rent paid pursuant to our leases with our trs are excessive, the deductibility thereof by the trs may be challenged, and we could be subject to a 100% excise tax on "re-determined rent" or "re-determined deductions" to the extent that such rent exceeds an arm's-length amount. the items subject to this 100% excise tax have been increased for tax years beginning on or after january 1, 2016. we believe that our rent and other transactions between our reits and their trs are based on arm's-length amounts and reflect normal business practices, but there can be no assurance that the irs will agree with our belief.
despite the reit status of each of host inc. and its subsidiary reit, we remain subject to various taxes.
notwithstanding host inc.'s status as a reit, host inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (including our subsidiary reit) are subject to federal, state, local and foreign corporate income taxes on their net income, gross receipts, and property, in certain cases. host l.p. is obligated under its partnership agreement to pay all such taxes (and any related interest and penalties) incurred by host inc.
dividends payable by reits do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.
the maximum tax rate applicable to "qualified dividend income" payable to u.s. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates is 20%. dividends payable by reits, however, generally are not eligible for these reduced rates. under the tax cuts and jobs act, however, u.s. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally may deduct up to 20% of the ordinary dividends (e.g., dividends not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income) received from a reit for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017 and before january 1, 2026. although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by reits (generally to 29.6% assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37% maximum rate), such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income. accordingly, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-reit corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of reits.
legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on us.
new legislation, treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could change significantly the tax laws with respect to an entity's qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of its reit qualification. if host inc. or its subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit, and any available relief provisions did not apply, the non-qualifying reit would not be allowed to take a deduction for distributions to its stockholders in computing its taxable income, and it would be subject to federal and state corporate income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. moreover, unless entitled to statutory relief, the non-qualifying reit could not qualify as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which reit qualification was lost.
the tax cuts and jobs act has significantly changed the u.s. federal income taxation of u.s. businesses and their owners, including reits and their stockholders. changes made by the tax cuts and jobs act that could affect us and our stockholders include:
•   temporarily reducing individual u.s. federal income tax rates on ordinary income; the highest individual u.s. federal income tax rate has been reduced from 39.6% to 37% for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017 and before january 1, 2026;

•   permanently eliminating the progressive corporate tax rate structure, which previously imposed a maximum corporate tax rate of 35%, and replacing it with a flat corporate tax rate of 21%;

•   permitting a deduction for certain pass-through business income, including dividends received by our stockholders from us that are not designated by us as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income, which will allow individuals, trusts, and estates to deduct up to 20% of such amounts for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017 and before january 1, 2026;

30
•   reducing the highest rate of withholding with respect to our distributions to non-u.s. stockholders that are treated as attributable to gains from the sale or exchange of u.s. real property interests from 35% to 21%;

•   limiting our deduction for net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017 to 80% of our reit taxable income (prior to the application of the dividends paid deduction);

•   generally limiting the deduction for net business interest expense in excess of 30% of a business's "adjusted taxable income," except for taxpayers that engage in certain real estate businesses (including most equity reits) and elect out of this rule (provided that such electing taxpayers must use an alternative depreciation system with longer depreciation periods); and

•   eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax.

many of these changes are effective immediately, without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions. the legislation is unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the treasury and irs, any of which could lessen or increase the impact of the legislation. in addition, it is unclear how these u.s. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities. while some of the changes made by the tax cuts and jobs act may adversely affect the company in one or more reporting periods and prospectively, other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis.
risks relating to redemption of op units a holder who offers its op units for redemption may have adverse tax consequences.
a holder who elects to redeem their op units will be treated for federal and state income tax purposes as having sold the op units. the sale of these units is a taxable event and the holder thereof will be treated as realizing an amount equal to the sum of (1) the value of the common stock or cash the holder receives, and (2) the amount of host l.p.'s nonrecourse liabilities allocated to the redeemed op units. the gain or loss recognized by the holder of op units is measured by the difference between the amount realized by the holder and the holder's tax basis in the op units redeemed (which tax basis includes the amount of host l.p.'s nonrecourse liabilities allocated to the redeemed op units). it is possible that the amount of gain and/or the tax liability related thereto that the holder recognizes and pays could exceed the value of the common stock or cash that the holder receives.
differences between an investment in shares of host inc. common stock and host l.p. op units may affect redeemed holders of op units.
if a holder elects to redeem their op units, we will determine whether the holder receives cash or shares of host inc.'s common stock in exchange for the op units. although an investment in shares of host inc.'s common stock is substantially similar to an investment in host l.p. op units, there are some differences.  these differences include form of organization, management structure, voting rights, liquidity and federal and state income taxation, some of which differences may be material to investors.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.
overview host inc. operates as a self-managed and self-administered reit that owns properties and conducts operations through host l.p., of which host inc. is the sole general partner and of which it holds approximately 99% of its common op units as of december 31, 2017. the remainder of host l.p.'s common op units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners. host inc. has the exclusive and complete responsibility for host l.p.'s day-to-day management and control.
host inc. is the largest lodging reit in nareit's composite index and one of the largest owners of luxury and upper upscale hotel properties. as of february 21, 2018, we own 93 hotels in the united states and internationally and have minority ownership interests in an additional 21 hotels through joint ventures in the united states, europe and the asia/pacific region. these hotels are operated primarily under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry. the majority of our hotels are located in central business districts of major cities, near airports and in resort/conference destinations.
our customers fall into three broad groups: transient business, group business and contract business, which accounted for approximately 60%, 34%, and 6%, respectively, of our 2017 room sales. transient business broadly represents individual business or leisure travelers. business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels. therefore, we will be significantly more affected by trends in business travel than trends in leisure demand. for a discussion of our customer categories, see " - our customers".
understanding our performance our revenues and expenses. our hotels are operated by third-party managers under long-term agreements, pursuant to which they typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each individual hotel. we provide operating funds, or working capital, which the managers use to purchase inventory and to pay wages, utilities, property taxes and other hotel-level expenses. we generally receive a cash distribution from our hotel managers each month, which distribution reflects hotel-level sales less property-level operating expenses (excluding depreciation).
operations from our domestic portfolio account for approximately 98% of our total revenues and 2% relate to our international hotels. the following table presents the components of our hotel revenue as a percentage of our total revenue:
% of 2017
revenues

•   rooms revenue. occupancy and average daily room rate are the major drivers of rooms revenue. the business mix of the hotel (group versus transient and retail versus discount business) is a significant driver of room rates.                                                                                                   65%
•   food and beverage revenue. food &amp; beverage revenue consists of revenue from group functions, which may include banquet revenue and audio and visual revenue, as well as outlet revenue from the restaurants and lounges at our properties.                                                                                   29%
•   other revenue. occupancy, the nature of the property (e.g., resort, etc.) and its price point are the main drivers of other ancillary revenue, such as attrition and cancellation, parking, golf course, spa, entertainment and other guest services. this category also includes retail and apartment rental revenue.            6%
40
hotel operating expenses represent approximately 98% of our total operating costs and expenses. the following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses:
% of 2017
operating costs and expenses

•   rooms expense. these costs include housekeeping, reservation systems, room supplies, laundry services and front desk costs. occupancy is the major driver of rooms expense. these costs can increase based on increases in salaries and wages, as well as on the level of service and amenities that are provided.                                                       19%
•   food and beverage expense. these expenses primarily include food, beverage and the associated labor costs and will correlate closely with food and beverage revenue. group functions with banquet sales and audio and visual components generally will have lower overall costs as a percentage of revenues than outlet sales.                                           23%
•   other departmental and support expenses. these expenses include labor and other costs associated with other ancillary revenue, such as parking, golf courses, spas, entertainment and other guest services, as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative departments, sales and marketing, repairs and minor maintenance and utility costs.           27%
•   management fees. base management fees are computed as a percentage of gross revenue. incentive management fees generally are paid when operating profits exceed certain thresholds.                                                                                                                                                                                       5%
•   other property-level expenses. these expenses consist primarily of real and personal property taxes, ground rent, equipment rent and property insurance. many of these expenses are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels.                                                                                       8%
•   depreciation and amortization expense. this is a non-cash expense that changes primarily based on the acquisition and disposition of hotel properties and the amounts of historical capital expenditures.                                                                                                                                                                16%
the expense components listed above are based on those presented in our consolidated statements of operations. it also is worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items. taken separately, these costs represent approximately 57% of our rooms, food and beverage, and other departmental and support expenses.
key performance indicators. the following key performance indicators are commonly used in the hospitality industry:
•   hotel occupancy (a volume indicator);

•   average daily rate ("adr") is a price indicator calculated by dividing room revenue by the number of rooms sold;

•   revenue per available room ("revpar") is to evaluate hotel operations. revpar is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved. revpar does not include food and beverage, parking, or other guest service revenues generated by the property. although revpar does not include these ancillary revenues, it is considered a key indicator of core revenues for many hotels; and

•   total revenue per available room ("total revpar") is a summary measure of hotel results calculated by dividing the sum of room, food and beverage and other ancillary service revenue by room nights available to guests for the period. it includes ancillary revenues not included within revpar.

revpar changes that are driven by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels, as well as incremental operating profit, than do changes that are driven by average room rate. for example, increases in occupancy at a hotel will lead to increases in room revenues and ancillary revenues, such as food and beverage revenue, as well as additional incremental costs (including housekeeping services, utilities and room amenity costs). revpar increases due to higher room rates, however, will not result in additional room-related costs, with the exception of those charged as a percentage of revenue. as a result, changes in revpar driven by increases or decreases in average room rates have a greater effect on profitability than do changes in revpar caused by occupancy levels.
in discussing our operating results, we present revpar and certain other financial data for our hotels on a comparable hotel basis. comparable hotels are those properties that we have owned for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared and which operations have been included in our consolidated results. comparable hotels do not include the results of properties acquired or sold, or that incurred business interruption due to significant property damage or large scale capital improvements. we also present
41
revpar separately for our comparable consolidated domestic and international (both on a nominal and constant dollar basis) hotels, as well as for our joint venture in europe. we provide revpar results in constant currency due to the number of consolidated properties we have internationally and the effect that exchange rates have on our reporting. we use constant currency because we believe it is useful to investors as it provides clarity on how the hotels are performing in their local markets. for all other measures (net income, operating profit, ebitda, ffo, etc.), our discussion refers to nominal us$, which is consistent with our financial statement presentation under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap").
we also evaluate the performance of our business through certain non-gaap financial measures. each of these non-gaap financial measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to gaap performance measures such as total revenues, operating profit, net income and earnings per share. we provide a more detailed discussion of these non-gaap financial measures, how management uses such measures to evaluate our financial condition and operating performance and a discussion of certain limitations of such measures in "-non-gaap financial measures." our non-gaap financial measures include:
•   nareit funds from operations ("ffo") and adjusted ffo per diluted share. we use nareit ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share as supplemental measures of company-wide profitability. nareit adopted ffo in order to promote an industry-wide measure of reit operating performance. we also adjust nareit ffo for gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, acquisition costs and litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business.

•   comparable hotel ebitda. hotel ebitda measures property-level results before debt service, depreciation and corporate expenses (as this is a property level measure) and is a supplemental measure of aggregate property-level profitability. we use hotel ebitda and associated margins to evaluate the profitability of our comparable hotels.

•   ebitda, ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare. earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") is a supplemental measure of our operating performance and facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging reits, hotel owners who are not reits and other capital-intensive companies. nareit adopted ebitda for real estate ("ebitdare") in order to promote an industry-wide measure of reit operating performance. we also adjust ebitdare for property insurance gains, the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, acquisition costs and litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business ("adjusted ebitdare").

revenue per available room in 2017, on a constant us$ basis, revpar at our comparable hotels increased 1.3% compared to 2016, representing the eighth consecutive year of positive revpar growth. while corporate demand has been softer than leisure transient demand in recent years, healthy consumer spending, strong consumer confidence and increased business spending led to near record occupancy for our hotels during the year. at the same time, supply growth has exceeded historic average growth rates in several of our major locations, including new york and houston, and has inhibited room rate growth. we also believe that increased price transparency from online travel agencies has further subdued rate growth.
revpar growth in 2017 was both rate and occupancy driven, as room rates improved 0.5% on a constant us$ basis and occupancy improved 60 basis points to 79.2%. transient revenues increased 0.8% for the year driven by a 0.8% increase in room nights sold, as average rate remained flat. group business was hampered by the continued environment of political and economic uncertainty, which muted corporate meeting activity. group revenue decreased 0.6%, as an increase in average rate of 1.5% was offset by a decline in room nights sold of 2.1%.
comparable hotel revpar for our domestic portfolio increased 1.7% for the year, driven by a 70 basis point improvement in occupancy and a 0.8% improvement in room rates. results were mixed across our portfolio during the year. seattle, denver and philadelphia led our domestic portfolio with revpar increases of 11.8%, 7.5%, and 7.1%, respectively, driven by improvements in occupancy in each of the locations as well as an increase of 5.2% in room rates in seattle. our washington d.c. (central business district "cbd") and northern virginia hotels benefited from the presidential inauguration and women's march in january, with revpar growth of 6% and 5.8%, respectively. in addition, our phoenix hotels outperformed the portfolio following the rebranding and renovation work at the camby hotel. conversely, our new york properties continued to lag the portfolio due to the supply growth described above, as revpar decreased 1.4% in 2017. additionally, our miami and houston locations experienced revpar decreases of 11.1% and 1.9%, respectively, during the year, primarily due to the impact of hurricanes irma and harvey and the recent influx of new supply. finally, revpar declined at our san francisco hotels as a result of the ongoing construction at the moscone convention center.
on a constant us$ basis, revpar for our comparable consolidated international hotels decreased 12.2% in 2017, due to the highly unfavorable comparison to the prior year, when brazil hosted the 2016 olympics and paralympics, as well as economic and over-supply issues in brazil. the decline in brazil was partially offset by strong results at our canadian properties. comparable revpar in constant euros for the unconsolidated euro jv properties increased 5.2% for the year.
rooms total room revenues decreased 0.1% for the year, reflecting lost revenue from our 2017 and 2016 hotel dispositions, partially offset by the 1.3% increase in comparable revpar on a constant dollar basis. total room expenses increased by 0.7%, primarily
43
reflecting an increase in wages and benefits, particularly in markets impacted by state or local minimum wage ordinances. the increase in wages and benefits was partially offset by productivity improvements and the effect of hotel sales.  comparable room revenues increased 1.1% for the year, while comparable room expenses increased 2.1%.
food and beverage food and beverage revenues decreased 2.4% for 2017, reflecting a 0.9% decrease at our comparable hotels and the lost revenue from our 2017 and 2016 hotel dispositions. the decrease was driven by the reduction in group business, which led to decreases in both outlet and banquet and audio visual revenue, as well as the negative impact of hurricanes harvey and irma. despite the revenue declines, food and beverage profitably increased as total food and beverage and comparable hotel food and beverage expenses decreased 3.9% and 1.8%, respectively.
operating profit operating margins (calculated based on gaap operating profit as a percentage of gaap revenues) decreased 10 basis points for 2017. these operating margins are affected significantly by several items, including dispositions, depreciation, and corporate expenses. our comparable hotel ebitda margins, which exclude these items, increased 10 basis points to 27.85%. the decline in gaap operating profit margins was due in part to an increase in depreciation, while the improvement in comparable hotel ebitda margins was driven by improvements in transient business during the year, coupled with decreases in insurance and sales and marketing costs, as well as cost efficiencies and productivity enhancements identified through our enterprise analytics. we also have focused on improving productivity at a number of our hotels over the past three years by initiating time and motion studies. these studies are designed to enable hotel managers to establish tighter labor model standards and improve and expand forecasting tools, to more effectively schedule labor based on demand and to minimize excess staffing, thereby reducing costs.
net income, adjusted ebitdare and adjusted ffo per diluted share net income for host inc. decreased $200 million in 2017 to $571 million due primarily to a $145 million decrease in gains on dispositions, a $27 million increase in depreciation expense and a $13 million increase in interest expense. as a result, host inc.'s diluted income per common share decreased 25.5% to $0.76. adjusted ffo per diluted share, which excludes gains on dispositions, debt extinguishment costs, and other real estate transactions, including depreciation, was $1.69 per share in both 2017 and 2016. net income, nareit and adjusted ffo and the related per share measures benefited from the following:
•   adjusted ebitdare increased $28 million to $1,510 million, reflecting improvement in hotel operations, which offset a net reduction due to the results of hotels acquired or sold during the comparable periods; and

•   per share measures were improved by the repurchase of 14 million common shares during 2016. the anti-dilutive effect of these purchases is computed on a weighted average basis.

the trends and transactions described above for host inc. affected host l.p., as the only significant difference between the host inc. and host l.p. statements of operations relates to the treatment of income attributable to the outside partners of host l.p. for the year, host l.p.'s net income decreased $200 million to $571 million, and the diluted income per common unit decreased 25.7% to $0.78 per common unit.
2018 outlook we are cautiously optimistic about the united states economy in 2018. gdp grew at a rate of 2.3% in 2017 and is expected to continue to accelerate. additionally, the recent passage of the tax cuts and jobs act, coupled with lower regulatory burdens, is expected to result in increased corporate profits and business investment in the coming year, which has historically correlated to strengthening business transient demand.
strong consumer confidence and near record low unemployment have the potential to further buoy the corporate and leisure transient travel segment. however, supply growth continued to accelerate in 2017, and this trend is expected to carry into 2018. in particular, some of our markets, such as new york and houston, have experienced above-average supply growth in 2017 that has significantly offset demand growth, which has made it more challenging for our operators to grow average rates. additionally, we believe that rate growth is currently inhibited by the increasing popularity of online sharing sites such as airbnb as well as online booking sites which increase price transparency. therefore, while we have noted positive economic indicators for overall lodging demand, supply growth continues to constrain overall revpar growth for our portfolio.
44
the net result of these trends means we anticipate that we will continue to experience high levels of occupancy in 2018; however, rate growth is expected to continue to be restricted, leading to forecast revpar growth for our comparable hotels on a constant dollar basis of between 0.5% and 2.5% for the full year 2018. we expect the first quarter of 2018 to underperform, as the first quarter of 2017 included significant activity surrounding the presidential inauguration and related activities. additionally, comparisons between our 2017 and 2018 results will be affected by changes in our portfolio due to acquisitions and dispositions.
as noted above, the current outlook for the lodging industry is uncertain; therefore, there can be no assurances that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will continue for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, slower than anticipated growth in the economy and changes in travel patterns. see part i item 1a. "risk factors."
strategic initiatives during 2017, we were able to execute on a number of transactions that we believe will enhance the value of our portfolio and improve future operating performance. in 2017 and early 2018, we completed the following activities:
acquisitions
•   on february 16, 2017, we purchased the don cesar and the related beach house suites in st. pete beach, florida for $214 million and selected davidson hotels &amp; resorts as manager. the hotel has been recognized for excellence by historic hotels of america, with 347 rooms and suites along the florida gulf coast, award-winning dining options and over 38,000 square feet of meeting space.

•   on march 7, 2017, we acquired the 305-room w hollywood in hollywood, california for $219 million. the hotel includes approximately 11,000 square feet of high-quality retail space and seven prominent supergraphic billboard signs.

•   on march 24, 2017, we acquired the ground lease at the miami marriott biscayne bay for $38 million.

•   subsequent to year end, we reached an agreement to acquire the 301-room andaz maui, 668-room grand hyatt san francisco, and 454-room hyatt regency coconut point for $1 billion with a $25 million deposit at-risk. the assets are fee simple and the hotels will continue to be hyatt-branded and managed by hyatt pursuant to long-term management agreements. the transaction is anticipated to close by the end of the first quarter, subject to customary closing conditions, as well as partitioning of hotel property at the grand hyatt san francisco from the adjacent retail property, which could delay the closing date beyond the first quarter. the transaction is expected to be funded through a combination of cash and drawing on the revolver portion of the credit facility.

dispositions
•   we completed the sale of five assets for proceeds of approximately $653 million, including the sale of the key bridge marriott, subsequent to year end, for $190 million, including $8 million contributed to the hotel's ff&amp;e replacement fund by the purchaser. the sale of the key bridge marriott represents the culmination of a multi-year effort that included the acquisition of the ground lease at the hotel in 2016 and working with numerous stakeholders to enhance its value. the 2017 sales also include the disposition of the hilton melbourne south wharf, which completed our strategic exit from the pacific region.

•   subsequent to year end, we reached an agreement to sell the w new york for $190 million, which we expect to close during the second quarter of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.

portfolio enhancements
•   we rebranded the ritz-carlton, buckhead in atlanta to the whitley, a luxury collection hotel, that will be managed by hei hotels &amp; resorts. this rebranding represents an opportunity to better match the hotel with the operator and brand.

•   we reached an agreement to franchise three additional properties and implemented hei hotels &amp; resorts as operator.

•   we obtained approvals for the rezoning of the golf course land at the phoenician, a luxury collection resort, subject to customary appeals. our revised masterplan includes an 18-hole golf course, new tennis complex and activity center

and allows for 60 acres of residential development. the approved plan allows for a mix of single-family, townhome and condominium units, for a total of approximately 360 units. the subdivided land is being marketed to third parties for the residential development; however, we would not anticipate any sale until 2019.

for 2018, we intend to continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation to seek to strengthen our portfolio and deliver stockholder value through multiple levers. these may include over time acquiring assets, investing in our portfolio, buying back stock (depending on market conditions) or returning capital through a meaningful quarterly dividend. we intend to take advantage of our strong capital position and overall scale to seek to acquire upper-upscale and luxury properties, through single asset or portfolio acquisitions, that we believe have sustainable competitive advantages to drive long-term value. at the same time, we will opportunistically sell assets when market conditions permit, including the pursuit of exiting international markets to focus on our domestic portfolio. we also continue to critically analyze our portfolio to seek to take advantage of the inherent value of our real estate holdings for its highest and best use.
capital projects we continue to pursue opportunities to enhance asset value through select capital improvements, including projects that are designed to increase the eco-efficiency of our hotels, incorporate elements of sustainable design and replace aging equipment and systems with more efficient technology. during 2017, we spent approximately $277 million on capital expenditures, of which $72 million was return on investment ("roi") capital expenditures and $205 million was on renewal and replacement projects.
for 2018, we expect capital expenditures of $475 million to $550 million, closer to our historical average spend. this total spend consists of $185 million to $220 million in roi projects and $290 million to $330 million in renewal and replacement projects. of the $185 million to $220 million of roi project spend, $114 million is related to transformative repositioning, which is primarily occurring at the san francisco marriott marquis. as a result, this hotel has been placed in our non-comparable hotel pool, effective january 1, 2018.
return of capital stock repurchase program and dividends. host inc.'s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program in 2017 pursuant to which we can repurchase up to $500 million of common stock. the common stock may be purchased from time to time, depending upon market conditions, and repurchases may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions or by other means, including through one or more trading plans designed to comply with rule 10b5-1 under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. the number of shares to be purchased also will depend upon operating results, funds generated by sales activity, dividends that may be required by those sales and investment options that may be available, including reinvesting in the portfolio or acquiring new hotels, as well as maintaining our strong leverage position. the program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. we did not repurchase any shares during 2017.
during 2017, host inc.'s board of directors declared dividends of $0.85 per share with respect to host inc.'s common stock. accordingly, host l.p. made distributions of $0.868270 per unit with respect to its common op units for 2017. on february 21, 2018, the board of directors authorized a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share on its common stock. the dividend will be paid on april 16, 2018, to stockholders of record on march 29, 2018. the amount of any future dividend will be determined by host inc.'s board of directors.
46
there can be no assurances that any future dividends or stock buybacks will match or exceed those set forth above for any number of reasons, including a decline in operations or an increase in liquidity needs. we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets in order to meet our near-term debt maturities, fund our capital expenditures programs and take advantage of investment opportunities.
financing transactions we believe that our ability to maintain an investment grade balance sheet and well-laddered maturity schedule is an important factor in our investment strategy.
during 2017, we issued $400 million of 37⁄8% series g senior notes due april 2024 and amended and restated our credit facility, extending the maturity of the revolver portion to may 2021, with two six-month extension options (subject to certain conditions). the amendment also extended the $500 million term loan that was due to mature in june 2017 to may 2021, with one 12-month extension option (subject to certain conditions) and lowered the margin for an all-in interest rate of 2.67% at december 31, 2017, based on host l.p.'s unsecured long-term debt rating. the maturity date for our second $500 million term loan was unchanged and matures in september 2020. as a result, we have no significant debt maturities until 2020. at december 31, 2017, our weighted average interest rate is 4.0% and our weighted average debt maturity is 5.1 years. we have a debt balance of $4.0 billion and a balanced maturity schedule wherein not more than 25% of our outstanding debt, representing 5% of our u.s. gaap gross asset value, is due in any given year.

statement of operations results and trends for 2017 and 2016, the following items have affected the year-over-year comparability of our operations.
•   the results of hotels acquired or sold during the comparable periods impacted year-over-year comparisons. our operations were affected by the sale of four hotels in 2017, ten hotels in 2016 and eight hotels in 2015. these dispositions were partially offset by the acquisition of three hotels during this timeframe: the w hollywood acquired in march 2017, the don cesar acquired in february 2017 and the phoenician acquired in june 2015. the table below presents the net (reduction)/increase on revenues and earnings due to the results of hotels acquired or sold during the comparable periods, collectively the "property transactions" (in millions):

•   the overall effect of disruptive renovation did not affect year-over-year comparability in 2017 compared to 2016. however, in 2016, we had fewer disruptive renovations compared to 2015. additionally, in 2016, we had a full year of operations for four hotels that had been closed for portions of 2015 for redevelopment.

•   over the past few years, we have strategically exited international markets, including the disposition of one hotel in australia in 2017 and six international properties in 2016. as a result, we have reduced our foreign currency exchange risk so that there now is minimal impact on our results of operations.

the following table presents revenues in accordance with gaap and includes both comparable and non-comparable hotels for the three years ended december 31, 2017 (in millions, except percentages):

the net decrease in total revenues in 2017 of $43 million primarily reflects a net reduction due to property transactions, in addition to lost revenues caused by the hurricanes in the third quarter of 2017. total revenues for our comparable properties increased 0.7% in 2017. the increase of $80 million in 2016 was driven by an increase of 2.8% in revenues for our comparable properties. total revenues for 2016 also were positively impacted by our non-comparable properties that were under renovation in 2015.
rooms. room revenues decreased $2 million in 2017 and increased $27 million in 2016, reflecting an increase in constant dollar revpar of 1.3% and 2.7%, respectively, at our comparable hotels, offset by a net decrease of $66 million in 2017 and $81 million in 2016 as a result of a net reduction due to property transactions.
food and beverage. f&b revenues decreased $38 million and increased $31 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, reflecting a reduction of group business in 2017 and an increase in 2016. for our comparable hotels, f&b revenues decreased 0.9% and increased 1.7%, respectively, for 2017 and 2016, as banquet and audio visual revenues decreased 1.4% in 2017 and increased 2.0% in 2016. 2017 results also were negatively impacted by hurricanes harvey and irma. year-over-year comparisons also reflect a net decrease of $41 million for 2017 and $20 million for 2016 as a result of a net reduction due to property transactions.
other revenues. other revenues decreased $3 million, or 0.9%, in 2017, as an increase in other revenues at our comparable hotels was offset by a net reduction due to property transactions. for our comparable hotels, other revenues increased 3.2%, primarily driven by an increase in amenity fees and additional rental income from the new york marriott marquis retail space. in 2016, other revenues increased $22 million, primarily due to increased amenity fees and attrition and cancellation fees at our comparable hotels.

operating expenses our operating costs and expenses, which consist of both fixed and variable components, are affected by a number of factors. rooms expense is affected mainly by occupancy, which drives costs related to items such as housekeeping, reservation systems, room supplies, laundry services and front desk costs. food and beverage expense correlates closely with food and beverage revenue, and is affected by occupancy and the mix of business between banquet and audio-visual and outlet sales. however, the most significant expense for room, food and beverage, and other departmental and support expenses is wages and employee benefits, which comprise approximately 57% of these expenses in any year. during 2017, these expenses increased approximately 1%, in part due to union contracts, government mandated wage increases and competition for labor in certain markets. other property-level expenses consist of property taxes, which are highly dependent on local taxing authorities, and property and general liability insurance, and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels.
rooms. rooms expense increased $6 million during 2017, reflecting the increase at our comparable properties of 2.1%, as a result of overall growth in wage rates, partially offset by a net decrease due to property transactions. in 2016, rooms expense decreased $9 million reflecting the net effect of recent property transactions, while at our comparable properties rooms expense increased 1.4%, driven by increases in wages, benefits and group travel agent commissions. year-over-year comparisons reflect net decreases of $17 million in 2017 and $23 million in 2016 as a result of a net reduction due to property transactions.
food and beverage. the decrease in f&b expenses of $43 million in 2017 and increase of $4 million in 2016 reflect the year-over-year decrease of 1.8% and increase of 0.3% in comparable f&b expenses in 2017 and 2016, respectively. the changes are consistent with the decline in f&b revenues in 2017 and increase in revenues in 2016. overall, f&b hourly productivity improved in both 2017 and 2016, resulting in declines in f&b costs as a percentage of revenues. year-over-year comparisons also reflect net decreases of $28 million in 2017 and $18 million in 2016 as a result of a net reduction due to property transactions.
other departmental and support expenses. other departmental and support expenses decreased $33 million and increased $11 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. for 2017, the decrease primarily reflects the net reduction due to property transactions, as other departmental and support expenses for our comparable properties increased 0.3%. the increase in 2016 primarily reflects increases in hourly wages and loyalty and reward program expenses, offset by a 6.4% decrease in administrative and general costs and an 8.1% decrease in utilities expense. year-over-year comparisons also reflect net decreases of $39 million in 2017 and $25 million in 2016 as a result of a net reduction due to property transactions.
management fees. management fees, which generally are calculated as a percentage of revenues and operating profit, increased 1.3% and 4.4% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. at our comparable hotels, base management fees, which are calculated as a percentage of total revenues, decreased 0.5% in 2017 and increased 1.0% in 2016, while incentive management fees increased 7.0% in 2017 and 14.8% in 2016. the increase in incentive management fees at our comparable hotels reflects the improvements in hotel operations. year-over-year comparisons also include net decreases of $4 million in 2017 and $6 million in 2016 as a result of a net reduction due to property transactions.
other property-level expenses. these expenses generally do not vary significantly based on occupancy and include expenses such as property taxes and insurance. other property-level expenses increased $12 million, or 3.1%, in 2017, and decreased $4 million, or 1.0%, in 2016. other property-level expenses at our comparable hotels increased 3.2% and 2.1% for 2017 and 2016,
50
respectively. both reflect an increase in property taxes and ground rent, partially offset by a decline in insurance expense, while the year-over-year changes for total other property-level expenses also reflect net decreases of $5 million in 2017 and $6 million in 2016 as a result of a net reduction due to property transactions.
depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization expense increased $27 million, or 3.7%, to $751 million in 2017 and increased $16 million, or 2.3%, to $724 million in 2016. the increase in 2017 is due to an impairment expense of $43 million at one property, while 2016 reflects the depreciation of our recent capital expenditures, both partially offset as a result of a net reduction due to property transactions.
other income and expense corporate and other expenses. corporate and other expenses include the following items (in millions):

general and administrative costs primarily consist of wages and benefits, travel, corporate insurance, legal fees, audit fees, building rent and systems costs. the 2016 corporate and other expenses include approximately $10 million of severance costs paid to our prior chief executive officer.
gain on insurance and business interruption settlements. we received $13 million of business interruption proceeds in 2017, which includes proceeds related to hurricane disruption that occurred in the third quarter of 2017 and proceeds from a facility funded by bp related to the 2010 deepwater horizon oil spill for disruption at several of our florida gulf coast properties. in 2016, we received $12 million of business interruption proceeds for the disruption of operations at the new orleans marriott caused by the 2010 deepwater horizon oil spill.
interest expense. interest expense increased $13 million, or 8.4%, in 2017 as compared to 2016, due to the issuance of the series g senior notes. interest expense decreased $73 million, or 32.2%, in 2016, due to the reduction of debt extinguishment costs as well as a reduction in the overall debt balance. the following table presents certain components of interest expense (in millions):

(2)   represents amortization of the previously deferred gain related to the land contributed to the maui jv.

equity in earnings of affiliates.  equity in earnings of affiliates primarily reflects our interest in the operations of the euro jv and our domestic joint ventures owning three hotels and a vacation ownership project. the increase in equity in earnings of affiliates in 2017 primarily reflects improved operations at the euro jv hotels, while the decrease in 2016 was due to the sale of nine properties in 2015 by the euro jv.
benefit (provision) for income taxes. we lease substantially all of our properties to consolidated subsidiaries designated as trs for federal income tax purposes. the difference between hotel-level operating cash flow and the aggregate rent paid to host l.p. by the trs represents taxable income or loss, on which we record an income tax provision or benefit. the tax provision in 2017 primarily reflects $17 million of capital gain tax on the sale of our hotel in australia, the reduction of certain deferred tax assets as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act passed in december 2017 in the amount of $11 million and an increase in domestic corporate income taxes resulting from increased profitability of hotel operations retained by the trs. the tax provision in 2016 primarily relates to domestic and foreign corporate income taxes on hotel operations retained by the trs and $9 million of capital gain tax on the sale of our two properties in chile.
comparable hotel sales overview while management evaluates the performance of each individual hotel against its competitive set in a given market, we also evaluate our overall portfolio operating results by geographic location and by mix of business (i.e. transient, group or contract). as of december 31, 2017, 87 of our 94 owned hotels have been classified as comparable hotels. see "comparable hotel operating statistics" for a complete description of our comparable hotels.

hotel sales by business mix.
the majority of our customers fall into three broad categories:  transient, group and contract business. the information below is derived from business mix results from 87 comparable hotels for which 2017 and 2016 business mix information is available. in 2017, overall revenue growth for our comparable hotels was driven by increases in transient and contract revenue of 0.8% and 16.2%, respectively. the increase in transient revenue was driven by an increase in room nights sold of 0.8% while transient average rate remained consistent with 2016. contract business benefited from a 15.9% increase in room nights due to additional airline contracts at hotels in markets where new supply or demand concerns warranted negotiating multi-year contracts at average rates exceeding $200 per night. group revenues declined 0.6% compared to the prior year, due to a decline in group room nights sold of 2.1%, partially offset by a 1.5% average room rate increase. group volume was negatively impacted by difficult comparisons with the olympics in 2016 for our properties in brazil and a decline in corporate group business.

hotel sales by business mix.
the information below is derived from business mix results from 88 comparable hotels for which 2016 and 2015 business mix information is available. in 2016, overall revenue growth was due to both group and transient growth. overall, group revenues improved 4.5% compared to the prior year, consisting of a 2.4% average room rate increase coupled with a 2.1% growth in group room nights sold. our hotels were able to drive group business through higher-rated association business, which led to a 7.5% increase in revenue. corporate group revenue increased 5.8% while government and leisure group declined 2.9%. revenue from our transient business increased 1.2%, reflecting an increase of 0.7% in average rate and an increase of 0.5% in room nights sold. special corporate
54
rooms declined 3.6%, as weakness in corporate business travel resulted in a negative mix shift, as operators replaced higher rated corporate business with lower rated business, such as contract, discount or government.
liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources of host inc. and host l.p. the liquidity and capital resources of host inc. and host l.p. are derived primarily from the activities of host l.p., which generates the capital required by our business from hotel operations, the incurrence of debt, the issuance of op units or the sale of properties. host inc. is a reit and its only significant asset is the ownership of partnership interests of host l.p.; therefore, its financing and investing activities are conducted through host l.p., except for the issuance of its common and preferred stock. proceeds from stock issuances by host inc. are contributed to host l.p. in exchange for op units. additionally, funds used by host inc. to pay dividends or to repurchase stock are provided by host l.p. therefore, while we have noted those areas in which it is important to distinguish between host inc. and host l.p., we have not included a separate discussion of liquidity and capital resources as the discussion applies both to host inc. and host l.p.
overview. we look to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with an appropriate balance of cash, debt and equity in order to provide financial flexibility given the inherent volatility in the lodging industry. we believe this strategy will result in a lower overall cost of capital, allow us to complete opportunistic investments and acquisitions and will position us to manage potential declines in operations throughout the lodging cycle. over the past several years, we have decreased our leverage as measured by our net debt-to-ebitda ratio and reduced our debt service obligations, leading to an increase in our fixed charge coverage ratio.
we intend to use available cash predominantly for acquisitions or other investments in our portfolio. if we are unable to find appropriate investment opportunities, we will consider other uses, such as a return of capital through dividends or common stock repurchases, the amounts of which will be determined by our operations and other market factors. significant factors we review to determine the amount and timing of common stock repurchases include our current stock price compared to our determination of the underlying value of our assets, current and forecast operating results and the completion of hotel sales.
we have structured our debt profile to maintain a balanced maturity schedule and to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt. currently, none of our consolidated hotels are encumbered by mortgage debt. we have access to multiple types of financing as substantially all of our debt consists of senior notes and borrowings under our credit facility, none of which are collateralized by specific hotel properties. our senior unsecured debt is rated investment grade by moody's investor services, fitch ratings and standard & poor's rating service, which has allowed us to borrow capital at lower rates than previously achieved. we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets to take advantage of opportunities to enhance our portfolio, withstand declines in operating cash flow, pay near-term debt maturities and fund our capital expenditures programs. we may continue to access the capital markets if favorable conditions exist in order to further enhance our liquidity and to fund cash needs. during 2017, we issued $400 million of senior notes and amended and restated our credit facility, extending its maturity.
if, at any time, we determine that market conditions are favorable, after taking into account our liquidity requirements, we may cause host l.p. to issue senior notes or debentures exchangeable for shares of host inc. common stock. given the total amount of our debt and maturity schedule, we will continue to redeem or refinance senior notes from time to time, taking advantage of favorable market conditions. in february 2018, host inc.'s board of directors authorized repurchases of up to $250 million of senior notes and mortgage debt other than in accordance with its terms, of which the entire amount remains available under this authority. we may purchase senior notes for cash through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, a tender offer or, in some cases, through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms. repurchases of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. any refinancing or retirement before the maturity date of our debt will affect earnings and nareit ffo per diluted share as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the acceleration of previously deferred financing costs. in addition, while we intend to use any available cash predominantly for acquisitions or other investments in our hotel portfolio, to the extent we do not identify appropriate investments, we may elect in the future to use available cash for other purposes, including share repurchases, subject to market conditions. accordingly, in light of our priorities in managing our capital structure and liquidity profile and given prevailing conditions and relative pricing in the capital markets, we may, at any time, subject to applicable securities laws, be considering, or be in discussions with respect to the repurchase or issuance of exchangeable debentures and/or senior notes or the repurchase or sale of common stock. any such transactions may, subject to applicable securities laws, occur simultaneously.
we continue to explore potential acquisitions and dispositions. we anticipate that any such future acquisitions will be funded primarily by proceeds from sales of properties, but also potentially from equity offerings of host inc., issuances of op units by host l.p., incurrence of debt, available cash or advances under our credit facility. given the nature of these transactions, we can make no assurances that we will be successful in acquiring any one or more hotels that we may review, bid on or negotiate to purchase or that we will be successful in disposing of any one or more of our properties. we may acquire additional properties or dispose of properties through various structures, including transactions involving single assets, portfolios, joint ventures, acquisitions of the securities or assets of other reits or spin off distributions of hotel properties to our stockholders.
55
cash requirements. we use cash for acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt payments, operating costs, corporate and other expenses, as well as for dividends and distributions to stockholders and unitholders. as a reit, host inc. is required to distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its taxable income, excluding net capital gain, on an annual basis. funds used by host inc. to pay dividends are provided by host l.p. our primary sources of cash include cash from operations, proceeds from the sale of assets, borrowings under our credit facility and debt and equity issuances. we have no significant debt maturities until 2020.
capital resources. as of december 31, 2017, we had $913 million of cash and cash equivalents and $822 million of available capacity remaining under the revolver portion of the credit facility. we depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth, including acquisitions. as a result, the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility and the ability to issue senior unsecured debt are key components of our capital structure. our financial flexibility (including our ability to incur debt, make distributions and make investments) is contingent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of such indebtedness, which include, among other things, the allowable amounts of leverage, interest coverage and fixed charges.
sources and uses of cash. in 2017, our primary sources of cash included cash from operations, proceeds from asset sales, and the issuance of senior notes. our primary uses of cash during the year consisted of acquisitions, capital expenditures, operating costs, debt repayments, and distributions to equity holders. we anticipate that our sources and uses of cash will be similar during 2018.
cash provided by operations. our cash provided by operations for 2017 decreased $72 million to $1,230 million compared to 2016, as an overall increase in earnings at the property-level was offset by increases in income taxes and interest paid. the decline also reflects an increase in receivables due from our managers and other assets compared to 2016.
cash used in investing activities. approximately $267 million of cash was used in investing activities during 2017 compared to $99 million in 2016. in addition to the acquisition and disposition activity detailed in the charts below, we spent approximately $277 million on capital expenditures, compared to $519 million in 2016. additionally, we have capitalized certain internal costs and interest expense associated with our capital expenditures projects in accordance with gaap. these capitalized costs were $8 million, $10 million and $13 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. cash provided by investing activities consisted of proceeds from the sale of four hotels in 2017 and ten hotels in 2016, property insurance proceeds in 2017, as well as the return of investment from joint ventures in both 2017 and 2016.
the following tables summarize significant acquisitions, dispositions and return of investments in affiliates from january 1, 2016 through february 21, 2018 (in millions):

senior notes. the following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indentures governing the various senior notes issued by host l.p., to which we refer collectively as the senior notes indenture. we pay interest on each series of our
58
outstanding senior notes semi-annually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above. under the terms of our senior notes indenture, our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of host l.p.'s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of host l.p.
guarantees. under the senior notes indentures, all host l.p. subsidiaries which guarantee host l.p. debt are required to similarly guarantee debt issuances under the indenture.
senior notes indenture covenants covenants for senior notes issued after we attained an investment grade rating on march 20, 2017, host l.p. completed an underwritten public offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.875% series g senior notes due 2024. at any time, upon not less than 15 nor more than 60 days' notice, the series g senior notes will be redeemable at host l.p.'s option, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus a make-whole premium as set forth in the indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. host l.p. also may redeem the series g senior notes within the period beginning 60 days prior to the april 1, 2024 maturity date, in whole or in part, upon not less than 15 nor more than 60 days' notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the series g senior notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. no senior notes were issued in 2016.
the series g senior notes have covenants customary for investment grade debt, primarily limitations on our ability to incur debt. there are no restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. these senior notes have covenants similar to our series d, e, and f senior notes, but are different than the covenants applicable to our prior series of senior notes issued before we attained our investment grade rating.
under the terms of the series d, e, f and g senior notes, host l.p.'s ability to incur indebtedness is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions, including the achievement of an ebitda-to-interest coverage ratio of at least 1.5x by host l.p. as calculated, this ratio excludes from interest expense items such as call premiums and deferred financing charges that are included in interest expense on host l.p.'s consolidated statement of operations. in addition, the calculation is based on host l.p.'s pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters, giving effect to certain transactions, such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings, as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. other covenants limiting host l.p.'s ability to incur indebtedness include maintaining total indebtedness of less than 65% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values), maintaining secured indebtedness of less than 40% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values) and maintaining total unencumbered assets of at least 150% of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding unsecured indebtedness of host l.p. and its subsidiaries. so long as host l.p. maintains the required level of interest coverage and satisfies these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture, it may incur additional debt.
we are in compliance with all of the financial covenants applicable to our series d, e, f and g senior notes. the following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the senior notes indenture for our series d, e, f and g senior notes and our actual credit ratios as of december 31, 2017:
actual ratio         covenant requirement

unencumbered assets tests                          498   %   minimum ratio of 150%
total indebtedness to total assets                  20   %   maximum ratio of 65%
secured indebtedness to total assets                 0   %   maximum ratio of 40%
ebitda-to-interest coverage ratio                  9.3   x   minimum ratio of 1.5x covenants for senior notes issued before we attained an investment grade rating currently, our senior notes have an investment grade rating from moody's, standard & poor's and fitch ratings. as a result, many of the restrictive covenants contained in the senior notes indenture and the supplemental indentures for our prior series of senior notes are not applicable, as they do not apply for so long as such series of notes maintain an investment grade rating from both moody's and standard & poor's. the following primary covenants continue to apply to our existing senior notes (other than our series d, e, f and g senior notes):
•   restrict our ability to sell all or substantially all of our assets or merge with or into other companies; and

•   require us to make an offer to repurchase the existing senior notes then currently outstanding upon the occurrence of a change of control.

59
if our senior notes no longer are rated investment grade by either or both of moody's and standard & poor's, then the following covenants and other restrictions will be reinstated for our senior notes (but will not apply to the series d, e, f and g senior notes which have different covenants):
•   our ability to incur indebtedness and make distributions will be subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions, including the achievement of an ebitda-to­interest coverage ratio of at least 2.0x. we will be able to make distributions to enable host inc. to pay dividends on its preferred stock, if any, under the senior notes indenture when our ebitda-to-interest coverage ratio is above 1.7 to 1.0. this ratio is calculated in accordance with the terms of our senior notes indenture applicable to our non-investment grade senior notes based on pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters, giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility, and amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at acquisition of a loan in order to establish the debt at fair value. these amounts are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations;

•   other covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness and make distributions would include maintaining total indebtedness of less than 65% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values), excluding intangible assets, and maintaining secured indebtedness and subsidiary indebtedness of less than 45% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values). so long as we maintain the required level of interest coverage and satisfy these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture applicable to our existing senior notes, we may make preferred or common op unit distributions and incur additional debt, including debt incurred in connection with an acquisition. even if we are below the coverage levels otherwise required to incur debt and make distributions when our senior notes no longer are rated investment grade, we still will be permitted to incur certain types of debt, including (i) credit facility debt, (ii) refinancing debt, (iii) up to $400 million of mortgage debt, which proceeds would be used to repay debt under the credit facility (and permanently reduce our ability to borrow under the credit facility by such amount), and (iv) up to $150 million of other debt. we also will be permitted to make distributions of estimated taxable income that are necessary to maintain host inc.'s reit status;

•   a requirement to maintain unencumbered assets, based on undepreciated book values, of not less than 125% of the aggregate amount of senior note debt, plus other debt not secured by mortgages. this coverage requirement must be maintained at all times and is distinct from the coverage requirements necessary to incur debt or make distributions discussed above (which consequences, where we fall below the coverage level, are limited to restricting our ability to incur new debt or make distributions, but which would not otherwise cause a default under our senior notes indenture); and

•   our ability to make distributions on, redeem or repurchase our op units; permit payment or distribution restrictions on certain of our subsidiaries; sell assets; enter into transactions with affiliates; and create certain liens will be restricted.

the following summarizes the actual credit ratios for our senior notes (other than the series d, e, f and g senior notes) as of december 31, 2017 and the covenant requirements contained in the senior notes indenture that would be applicable at such times as our senior notes no longer are rated investment grade by either of moody's or standard & poor's. even if we were to lose the investment grade rating, we would be in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the senior notes indenture:
actual ratio*         covenant requirement

unencumbered assets tests                          504   %   minimum ratio of 125%
total indebtedness to total assets                  20   %   maximum ratio of 65%
secured indebtedness to total assets                 0   %   maximum ratio of 45%
ebitda-to-interest coverage ratio                  9.2   x   minimum ratio of 2.0x

*   because of differences in the calculation methodology between our series d, series e, series f and series g senior notes and our other senior notes, our actual ratios as reported can be slightly different.

credit facility. on may 31, 2017 we entered into the fourth amended and restated senior revolving credit and term loan facility with bank of america, n.a. as administrative agent, jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. as syndication agent, and certain other agents and lenders. the credit facility allows for revolving borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1 billion. the revolver also includes a foreign currency subfacility for canadian dollars, australian dollars, euros, british pound sterling and, if available to the lenders, mexican pesos of up to the foreign currency equivalent of $500 million, subject to a lower amount in the case of mexican pesos borrowings. the credit facility also provides for the existing term loan facility of $1 billion (which is fully utilized), a subfacility of up to $100 million for swingline borrowings in u.s. dollars, canadian dollars, euros or british pounds sterling and a subfacility of up to $100 million for issuances of letters of credit. host l.p. also has the option to increase the aggregate principal amount of the
60
revolving credit facility and/or term loan facility of the credit facility by up to $500 million, subject to obtaining additional loan commitments and the satisfaction of certain conditions.
the revolving credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity of may 2021, with the option for host l.p. to extend the term for two additional six-month terms, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee and the accuracy of representations and warranties, and $500 million of term loans have an initial scheduled maturity of may 2021, with an option for host l.p. to extend the term for one additional year, subject to similar conditions. a second $500 million of term loans was not affected by the restatement and is scheduled to mature in september 2020.
neither the revolving credit facility nor the term loans, as applicable, requires any scheduled amortization payments prior to maturity. the term loans otherwise are subject to the same terms and conditions as those in the credit facility regarding subsidiary guarantees, operational covenants, financial covenants and events of default (as discussed below).
guarantees. the credit facility requires all host l.p. subsidiaries which guaranty host l.p. debt to similarly guarantee obligations under the credit facility but otherwise removed the requirement under the prior agreement that guarantees and pledges are required in the event that host l.p.'s leverage ratio exceeds 6.0x for two consecutive fiscal quarters at a time that host l.p. does not have an investment grade long-term unsecured debt rating.
prepayments. voluntary prepayments of revolver borrowings and term loans under the credit facility are permitted in whole or in part without premium or penalty. the loans under the credit facility are required to be prepaid in the event that asset sales reduce adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values) to below $10 billion if we do not reinvest the proceeds of those asset sales in new properties. at december 31, 2017, we have adjusted total assets, as defined in our credit facility, of $20 billion.
financial covenants.  the credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage. we are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our leverage ratio is not in excess of 7.25x, our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than 1.75x and our fixed charge coverage ratio is not less than 1.25x. the financial covenants for the credit facility do not apply when there are no borrowings under the credit facility. thus, so long as there are no amounts outstanding thereunder and the term loans are repaid, we would not be in default if we do not satisfy the financial covenants and we do not lose the potential to draw under the revolver portion of the credit facility in the future if we were ever to regain compliance with the financial covenants. these calculations are performed based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters, giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. under the terms of the credit facility, interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility, amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at issuance of a loan in order to establish its fair value and non-cash interest expense, all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations. additionally, total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a "net debt" concept, pursuant to which cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million are deducted from our total debt balance.
we are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the credit facility. the following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the credit facility as of december 31, 2017:
actual ratio         covenant requirement for all years

leverage ratio                                      2.2   x   maximum ratio of 7.25x fixed charge coverage ratio                         6.6   x   minimum ratio of 1.25x unsecured interest coverage ratio (1)               9.8   x   minimum ratio of 1.75x
___________
(1)   if at any time our leverage ratio is above 7.0x, our minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio will be reduced to 1.5x.

interest and fees. we pay interest on revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates equal to libor plus a margin. the margin ranges from 82.5 to 155 basis points (depending on host l.p.'s unsecured long-term debt rating). we also pay a facility fee ranging from 12.5 to 30 basis points, depending on our rating and regardless of usage. based on host l.p.'s unsecured long-term debt rating as of december 31, 2017, we are able to borrow at a rate of libor plus 100 basis points and pay a facility fee of 20 basis points. interest on the term loans consists of floating rates equal to libor plus a margin ranging from 90 to 175 basis points (depending on host l.p.'s unsecured long-term debt rating). based on host l.p.'s long-term debt rating as of december 31, 2017, our applicable margin on libor loans under both term loans is 110 basis points.
other covenants and events of default. the credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters. certain covenants are less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x, as currently is the case. in particular, at any time that
61
our leverage ratio is below 6.0x, we will not be subject to limitations on capital expenditures, and the limitations on acquisitions, investments, dividends and distributions contained in the credit facility will be superseded by the generally less restrictive corresponding covenants in our senior notes indenture to the extent applicable, while our senior notes maintain an investment grade rating. additionally, the credit facility's restrictions on incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends and distributions generally are consistent with our senior notes indenture. these provisions, under certain circumstances, limit debt incurrence to debt incurred under the credit facility or in connection with a refinancing, and limit dividend payments to those necessary to maintain host inc.'s tax status as a reit.
the credit facility also includes usual and customary events of default for facilities of this nature, and provides that, upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default, payment of all amounts due under the credit facility may be accelerated and the lenders' commitments may be terminated. in addition, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default, all amounts due under the credit facility automatically will become due and payable and the lenders' commitments automatically will terminate.
mortgage debt of unconsolidated partner interests. we own non-controlling interests in partnerships and joint ventures that are not consolidated and that are accounted for under the equity method. the portion of the mortgage and other debt of these partnerships and joint ventures attributable to us, based on our ownership percentage thereof, was $472 million at december 31, 2017. the mortgage debt related to the hotels owned by our euro jv contains operating covenants that could result in the joint venture being required to escrow cash from operations or to make principal payments without penalty. the debt of our unconsolidated joint ventures is non-recourse to us. see "-off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations."
distribution/dividend. host inc.'s policy on common dividends generally is to distribute, over time, at least 100% of its taxable income, which primarily is dependent on our results of operations, as well as gains and losses on property sales. host inc. paid a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share and a special cash dividend of $0.05 per share on its common stock on january 16, 2018 to stockholders of record as of december 29, 2017. the $0.20 per share dividend represents host inc.'s intended regular quarterly cash dividend for the next several quarters, subject to board approval. while host inc. intends to use available cash predominantly for acquisitions or other investments in its portfolio, to the extent that we do not identify appropriate investments, we may elect in the future, subject to market conditions, to use available cash for other purposes, such as common stock repurchases or increased dividends, which dividends could be in excess of taxable income. any special dividend will be subject to approval by host inc.'s board of directors.
funds used by host inc. to pay dividends are provided through distributions from host l.p. as of december 31, 2017, host inc. is the owner of approximately 99% of host l.p.'s common op units. the remaining common op units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners. each op unit may be offered for redemption by the holders for cash or, at the election of host inc., host inc. common stock based on the then current conversion ratio. the current conversion ratio is 1.021494 shares of host inc. common stock for each op unit.
investors should take into account the 1% non-controlling position of host l.p. op units when analyzing dividend payments by host inc. to its stockholders, as these holders of op units share, on a pro rata basis, in amounts being distributed by host l.p. to holders of its op units. for example, if host inc. paid a $1 per share dividend on its common stock, it would be based on the payment of a $1.021494 per common unit distribution by host l.p. to host inc., as well as to the other common op unitholders.
counterparty credit risk. we are subject to counterparty credit risk, which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price. we assess the ability of our counterparties to fulfill their obligations to determine the impact, if any, of counterparty bankruptcy or insolvency on our financial condition. we are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions, access to our credit facility and amounts due or payable under our derivative contracts. our credit exposure in each of these cases is limited. our exposure with regard to our cash and the available capacity under the revolver portion of our credit facility is mitigated, as the credit risk is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions. at december 31, 2017, all our derivative contracts were in liability positions. therefore, we had no exposure risk related to our derivative contracts.
off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations off-balance sheet arrangements. we are party to various transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements with unconsolidated entities (which we refer to as "off-balance sheet arrangements"), pursuant to which we have certain contingent liabilities and/or guarantees. contingencies included on our balance sheet are discussed in part ii item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data - note 16. "guarantees and contingencies." as of december 31, 2017, we are party to the following material off-balance sheet arrangements:
62
european joint venture. the euro jv consists of two separate funds, with our partners apg strategic real estate pool nv, an affiliate of a dutch pension fund ("apg") and jasmine hotels pte ltd, an affiliate of the real estate investment company of the government of singapore investment corporation pte ltd ("gic re"). we serve as the general partner for the joint venture and have a combined general and limited partner interest of 32.1% of euro jv fund i and 33.4% of euro jv fund ii. due to the ownership structure and substantive participating rights of the non-host limited partners, including approval over financing, acquisitions and dispositions, and annual operating and capital expenditures budgets, the euro jv is not consolidated in our financial statements. as of december 31, 2017, the book value of the total assets of the euro jv are approximately €1.7 billion.
our investment and partners' funding as of december 31, 2017 is as follows:
host's net investment                total partner funding

euros                                     us$   euros

euro jv fund i    €           105                          $126   €                   440
euro jv fund ii   121                                       145   371
€           226                          $271   €                   811
the commitment period for both funds for acquisitions has expired. the remaining commitment is limited to investments in the current portfolio of hotels, including capital expenditures and debt repayments.
as asset manager of the euro jv funds, we earn an asset management fee based on the amount of equity invested, which in 2017, 2016 and 2015 aggregated approximately $8 million, $8 million and $11 million, respectively.
during 2017, the euro jv distributed €82 million to its partners, of which host's share was €26 million ($31 million). during 2016, the euro jv distributed €47 million to its partners, of which host's share was €15 million ($18 million). in 2015, the euro jv distributed €328.5 million to its partners, of which host's share was €107 million ($115 million), which distribution primarily was funded by proceeds from the disposition of nine hotels. the euro jv invested approximately €22 million in 2017 and €23 million in both 2016 and 2015, in capital expenditures projects.
in december 2017, the euro jv acquired the hilton amsterdam airport schiphol for €148 million ($175 million). in connection with the acquisition, the partnership entered into a mortgage loan in the amount of €81.4 million which matures on december 13, 2022 and the partners contributed €70 million, of which host contributed €23 million ($27 million).
the euro jv has €857 million of debt, all of which is non-recourse to us. a default of the euro jv mortgage debt does not trigger a default under any of our debt. the weighted average interest rate of the euro jv debt is 2.4% and it has a weighted average maturity of 3.7 years.
asia/pacific joint venture. we have a 25% interest in the asia/pacific jv with reco hotels jv private limited, an affiliate of gic re. the agreement may be terminated by either partner at any time, which would trigger the liquidation of the jv. due to the ownership structure and the substantive participating rights of the non-host limited partner, including approval over financing, acquisitions and dispositions, and annual operating and capital expenditures budgets, the asia/pacific jv is not consolidated in our financial statements. the commitment period for equity contributions to the asia/pacific jv has expired. certain funding commitments remain, however, related to its existing investments in india.
as of december 31, 2017, the partners have invested approximately $104 million (of which our share is $26 million) in a separate joint venture in india with accor s.a. and interglobe enterprises limited, in which the asia/pacific jv holds a 36% interest. this joint venture owns seven hotels in delhi, bangalore and chennai, totaling approximately 1,720 rooms. the hotels are managed by accorhotels under the pullman, ibis and novotel brands.
maui joint venture. we own a 67% interest in a joint venture with an affiliate of hv global group, a subsidiary of interval leisure group ("interval"), that owns a 131-unit vacation ownership development in maui, hawaii adjacent to our hyatt regency maui resort & spa (the "maui jv"). our ownership is a non-controlling interest as a result of the significant economic rights held by the interval member, which also is the managing member. since 2012, we have contributed approximately $87 million to the maui jv, which includes the contribution of land valued at $36 million. during 2017, the maui jv repaid its outstanding construction loan, releasing us of our guarantees, and it began making distributions to its partners. during 2017, we received a distribution of $7 million from the maui jv. during 2017, 2016 and 2015, the maui jv recognized $54 million, $55 million and $76 million, respectively, of sales of timeshare units.
63
hyatt place joint venture. we own a 50% interest in a joint venture with white lodging services that owns the 255-room hyatt place nashville downtown in tennessee. the joint venture has a $60 million mortgage loan that is non-recourse to us. due to the significant participating rights of our partner, we do not consolidate the joint venture in our financial statements. during 2017, we received approximately $3 million of distributions from the joint venture as a result of excess cash from operations.
harbor beach joint venture. we own a 49.9% interest in a joint venture with r/v-c association that owns the 650-room fort lauderdale marriott harbor beach resort & spa in florida. the joint venture has approximately $150 million of mortgage debt that is non-recourse to us. due to significant participating rights of our partner, we do not consolidate the joint venture in our financial statements. during 2017, we received approximately $7 million of distributions from the joint venture as a result of excess cash from operations.
for additional discussion on each of our joint venture investments, see part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 3. "investments in affiliates."
contractual obligations. the table below summarizes our obligations for principal and estimated interest payments on our debt, future minimum lease payments on our operating and capital leases, projected capital expenditures and other long-term liabilities, each as of december 31, 2017 (in millions):

___________
(1)   the amounts shown include amortization of principal, debt maturities and estimated interest payments. interest payments have been reflected based on the weighted average interest rate.

(2)   our only purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures at our hotels. under our contracts, we have the ability to defer some of these expenditures into later years.

(3)   the amounts shown include deferred management fees, obligations to third-parties related to prior property transactions and the estimated amount of tax expense related to uncertain tax liabilities.

tax sharing arrangements. under tax sharing agreements with former affiliated companies (such as marriott international, inc., hms host and barceló crestline corporation), we are obligated to pay certain taxes (federal, state, local and foreign, including any related interest and penalties) relating to periods in which the companies were affiliated with us. for example, a taxing authority could adjust an item deducted by a former affiliate during the period that such former affiliate was owned by us. this adjustment could result in a tax liability that we may be obligated to pay under the tax sharing agreement. additionally, under the partnership agreement between host inc. and host l.p., host l.p. is obligated to pay certain taxes (federal, state, local and foreign, including any related interest and penalties) incurred by host inc., as well as any liabilities the irs may successfully assert against host inc. we do not expect any amounts paid under these tax sharing arrangements to be material.
tax indemnification agreements. as a result of certain federal and state income tax considerations of the former owners of two hotels currently owned by host l.p., we have agreed to restrictions on selling such hotels, or repaying or refinancing mortgage debt, for varying periods. one of these agreements expires in 2028 and the other in 2031.
guarantees. we have entered into certain guarantees, which consist of commitments we have made to third parties for leases or debt, that are not recorded on our books due to various dispositions, spin-offs and contractual arrangements, but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances, including default by an unrelated party. we consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be remote. for a discussion of the largest guarantees (by dollar amount) see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 16. guarantees and contingencies."
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the
64
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the impairment of long-lived assets, on an ongoing basis. we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. for a detailed discussion of the following critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 1. summary of significant accounting policies:"
•   business combinations;

•   property and equipment - impairment testing;

•   property and equipment - other-than-temporary impairment of an investment;

•   property and equipment - classification of assets as "held for sale"; and

•   basis of presentation and principles of consolidation.

application of new accounting standards see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for information regarding accounting standards we adopted in 2017 and other new accounting standards that have been issued by the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") but are not effective until after december 31, 2017.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606). the standard sets forth steps to determine the timing and amount of revenue to be recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects in exchange. beginning in 2015, the fasb issued a number of asus to provide further clarification related to this standard and to defer the effective date to reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. additionally, in february 2017, the fasb issued asu no. 2017-05, other income - gains and losses from the derecognition of nonfinancial assets (subtopic 610-20), which is required to be adopted concurrently, as it provides further guidance on accounting for the derecognition of and partial sales of a nonfinancial asset. based on our assessment of this standard, it will not materially affect the amount or timing of revenue recognition for revenues from room, food and beverage, and other hotel level sales; however, it may allow for earlier gain recognition for certain sale transactions pursuant to which we have continuing involvement with the asset. upon adoption, we will implement these standards using a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative effect recognized with no restatements of prior period amounts.
in february 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-02, leases (topic 842), which affects aspects of accounting for lease agreements. under the new standard, all leases, including operating leases, will require recognition of the lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees on the balance sheet. however, the effect on the statement of operations and the statement of cash flows largely is unchanged. the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018, with early application permitted. the standard requires a modified retrospective approach, with restatement of the periods presented in the year of adoption. the primary impact of the new standard will be to the treatment of our 26 ground leases, which represent approximately 85% of all of our operating lease payments. while we have not completed our analysis, we believe that the application of this standard will result in the recording of a right of use asset and the related lease liability of between $400 million and $500 million for the ground leases, although changes in discount rates, ground lease terms or other variables may have a significant effect on this calculation. as noted above, we expect that the adoption of this standard will have minimal impact on our income statement.
in march 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-09, improvements to employee share-based payment accounting, which is intended to simplify accounting for share-based payment transactions and will affect the classification of certain share-based awards and related income tax withholdings. the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. as a result of the standard, the share-based payment awards granted in 2017 are equity-classified awards, and the excess tax benefits or deficiencies that are generated or incurred based on the difference between the intrinsic value of the award and the grant-date fair value is recognized as income tax benefit or expense on the income statement. the adoption of this standard has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
in november 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-18, statement of cash flows (topic 230): restricted cash, which requires that, on the statement of cash flows, amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and ending total amounts thereof. we adopted this standard beginning january 1, 2017. as a result, amounts included in restricted cash and furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement fund on our consolidated balance sheet are included with cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statement of cash flows. these items
65
totaled $196 million, $172 million and $156 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the adoption of this standard did not change our balance sheet presentation.
in january 2017, the fasb issued asu no. 2017-01, business combinations (topic 805): clarifying the definition of a business. the standard adopts a two-step approach wherein, if substantially all the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single (group of similar) identifiable asset(s), then the transaction will be considered an asset purchase. as a result of this standard, we anticipate that the majority of our hotel purchases will be considered asset purchases as opposed to business combinations, although the determination will be made on a transaction-by-transaction basis. this standard will be applied on a prospective basis and, therefore, it does not affect the accounting for any of our previous transactions. the standard is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.
our customers our customers fall into three broad groups: transient business, group business and contract business. similar to the majority of the lodging industry, we further categorize business within these broad groups based on characteristics they have in common as follows:
transient business broadly represents individual business or leisure travelers. business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels. therefore, we will be significantly more affected by trends in business travel than trends in leisure demand. the four key subcategories of the transient business group are:
•   retail: this is the benchmark rate that a hotel publishes and offers to the general public. it typically is the rate charged to travelers that do not have access to negotiated or discounted rates. it includes the "rack rate," which typically is applied to rooms during high demand periods and is the highest rate category available. retail room rates will fluctuate more freely depending on anticipated demand levels (e.g. seasonality and weekday vs. weekend stays).

•   non-qualified discount: these include special rates offered by the hotels, including packages, advance-purchase discounts and promotional offers. these also include rooms booked through online travel agencies (otas).

•   special corporate: this is a negotiated rate offered to companies and organizations that provide significant levels of room night demand to the hotel or to hotel brands generally. these rates typically are negotiated annually at a discount to the anticipated retail rate. in addition, this category includes rates offered at the prevailing per diem for approved government travel.

•   qualified discount: this category encompasses all discount programs, such as aaa and aarp discounts, rooms booked through wholesale channels, frequent guest program redemptions, and promotional rates and packages offered by a hotel.

group business represents clusters of guestrooms booked together, usually with a minimum of 10 rooms. the three key sub-categories of the group business category are:
•   association: group business related to national and regional association meetings and conventions.

•   corporate: group business related to corporate meetings (e.g., product launches, training programs, contract negotiations, and presentations).

•   other: group business predominately related to social, military, education, religious, fraternal and youth and amateur sports teams, otherwise known as smerf business.

contract business refers to blocks of rooms sold to a specific company for an extended period of time at significantly discounted rates. airline crews are typical generators of contract demand for our airport hotels. additionally, contract rates may be utilized by hotels that are located in markets that are experiencing consistently lower levels of demand.
comparable hotel operating statistics to facilitate a year-to-year comparison of our operations, we present certain operating statistics (i.e., revpar, average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues, expenses, hotel ebitda and associated margins) for the periods included in this report on a comparable hotel basis to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance.

because these statistics and operating results relate only to our hotel properties, they exclude results for our non-hotel properties and other real estate investments. we define our comparable hotels as properties:
(i)   that are owned or leased by us and the operations of which are included in our consolidated results, whether as continuing operations or discontinued operations, for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared; and

(ii)   that have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption, or undergone large-scale capital projects (as further defined below) during the reporting periods being compared.

the hotel business is capital-intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business. generally, hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels. a large scale capital project that would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set is an extensive renovation of several core aspects of the hotel, such as rooms, meeting space, lobby, bars, restaurants and other public spaces. both quantitative and qualitative factors are taken into consideration in determining if the renovation would cause a hotel to be removed from the comparable hotel set, including unusual or exceptional circumstances such as: a reduction or increase in room count, rebranding, a significant alteration of the business operations, or the closing of the hotel during the renovation.
we do not include an acquired hotel in our comparable hotel set until the operating results for that hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year. for example, we acquired the don cesar in february 2017. the hotel will not be included in our comparable hotel set until january 1, 2019. hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed. similarly, hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption or commence a large-scale capital project. in each case, these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after completion of the repair of the property damage or cessation of the business interruption, or the completion of large-scale capital projects, as applicable.
of the 94 hotels that we owned on december 31, 2017, 87 have been classified as comparable hotels. the operating results of the following hotels that we owned as of december 31, 2017 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:
•   the denver marriott tech center, removed in the first quarter of 2016 (business disruption due to extensive renovations, including conversion of 64 rooms to 41 suites, conversion of the concierge lounge into three meeting rooms, and the repositioning of the public space and food and beverage areas);

•   the hyatt regency san francisco airport, removed in the first quarter of 2016 (business disruption due to extensive renovations, including all guestrooms and bathrooms, meeting space, the repositioning of the atrium into a new restaurant and lounge, and conversion of the existing restaurant to additional meeting space);

•   marriott marquis san diego marina, removed in the first quarter of 2015 (business interruption due to the demolition of the existing conference center and construction of the new exhibit hall);

•   the phoenician (acquired in june 2015 and, beginning in second quarter 2016, business disruption due to extensive renovations, including all guestrooms and suites, a redesign of the lobby and public areas, renovation of pools, recreation areas and a restaurant and a re-configured spa and fitness center);

•   axiom hotel (acquired as the powell hotel in january 2014, then closed during 2015 for extensive renovations and reopened in january 2016);

•   the don cesar and beach house suites complex (acquired february 2017); and

•   w hollywood (acquired march 2017).

the operating results of 14 hotels disposed of in 2017 and 2016 are not included in comparable hotel results for the periods presented herein. none of our hotels have been excluded from our comparable hotel results due to hurricanes harvey or irma. in 2018, the following hotels will be excluded from our comparable hotel results because they will be undergoing large-scale capital projects during the comparable periods reported: the san francisco marriott marquis; the ritz-carlton, naples; and the phoenician. we also will exclude the key bridge marriott, which we sold in january, along with any hotels acquired or sold during 2018.
as of december 31, 2016, 88 of our 96 hotels were classified as comparable. the operating results of the following hotels that we owned as of december 31, 2016 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:
•   the denver marriott tech center, removed in the first quarter of 2016 (business disruption due to extensive renovations, including conversion of 64 rooms to 41 suites, conversion of the concierge lounge into three meeting rooms, and the repositioning of the public space and food and beverage areas);

67
•   the hyatt regency san francisco airport, removed in the first quarter of 2016 (business disruption due to extensive renovations, including all guestrooms and bathrooms, meeting space, the repositioning of the atrium into a new restaurant and lounge, and conversion of the existing restaurant to additional meeting space);

•   the camby hotel (previously the ritz-carlton, phoenix), removed in the third quarter of 2015 (business interruption due to rebranding, including closure of the hotel in july 2015 for extensive renovation work);

•   the logan (previously the four seasons philadelphia), removed in the first quarter of 2015 (business interruption due to rebranding, including closure of the hotel in order to expedite renovation efforts);

•   houston airport marriott at george bush intercontinental, removed in the first quarter of 2015 (business interruption due to complete repositioning of the hotel, including guest room renovations and the closure of two restaurants to create a new food and beverage outlet and lobby experience);

•   marriott marquis san diego marina, removed in the first quarter of 2015 (business interruption due to the demolition of the existing conference center and construction of the construction of the new exhibit hall);

•   the phoenician (acquired in june 2015 and, beginning in second quarter 2016, business disruption due to extensive renovations, including all guestrooms and suites, a redesign of the lobby and public areas, renovation of pools, recreation areas and a restaurant and a re-configured spa and fitness center); and

•   axiom hotel (acquired as the powell hotel in january 2014, then closed during 2015 for extensive renovations and reopened in january 2016).

constant us$ and nominal us$
operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction, or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. for comparative purposes, we also present the revpar results for 2016 assuming the results of our foreign operations were translated using the same exchange rates that were effective for the comparable periods in 2017, thereby eliminating the effect of currency fluctuation for the year-over-year comparisons. we believe this presentation is useful to investors as it provides clarity with respect to the growth in revpar in the local currency of the hotel consistent with the manner in which we would evaluate our domestic portfolio. however, the effect of changes in foreign currency has been reflected in the actual results of net income, ebitda, adjusted ebitdare, earnings per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share. nominal us$ results include the effect of currency fluctuations consistent with our financial statement presentation.
non-gaap financial measures we use certain "non-gaap financial measures," which are measures of our historical financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, within the meaning of applicable sec rules. these measures are as follows: (i) ebitda, ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare as a measure of performance for host inc. and host l.p., (ii) funds from operations ("ffo") and ffo per diluted share (both nareit and adjusted), as a measure of performance for host inc., and (iii) comparable hotel property level operating results, as a measure of performance for host inc. and host l.p.
we calculate ebitdare and nareit ffo per diluted share in accordance with standards established by nareit, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the nareit definition of ebitdare and ffo or do not calculate ffo per diluted share in accordance with nareit guidance. in addition, although ebitdare and ffo per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other reits, they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-reits. we also calculate adjusted ffo per diluted share, which measure is not in accordance with nareit guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other reits. ebitda and adjusted ebitdare, as presented, also may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies. this information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with gaap. cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures), interest expense (for ebitda, ebitdare, and adjusted ebitdare purposes only) and other items have been and will be made and are not reflected in the ebitda, ebitdare, adjusted ebitdare, nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share presentations. management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-gaap financial measures. additionally, nareit ffo per diluted share, adjusted ffo per diluted share, ebitda, ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare should not be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. in addition, nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share do not measure, and should not be used as measures of, amounts that accrue directly to stockholders' benefit.
68
similarly, ebitdare, adjusted ebitdare, nareit ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and nareit ffo and adjusted ffo include adjustments for non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in seven domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 21 properties and a vacation ownership development. due to the voting rights of the outside owners, we do not control and, therefore, do not consolidate these entities. the non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in host lp held by outside partners and interests ranging from 15% to 48% held by outside partners in two partnerships, each owning one hotel for which we do control the entity and, therefore, consolidate its operations. these pro rata results for nareit ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share, ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare are calculated as set forth below. readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for nareit ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our investments in these entities. the following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance.
ebitda, ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare ebitda earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. management believes ebitda provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). management also believes the use of ebitda facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging reits, hotel owners that are not reits and other capital-intensive companies. management uses ebitda to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and, like ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share, it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for compensation programs.
ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare we present ebitdare in accordance with nareit guidelines, as defined in its september 2017 white paper "earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate," to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of our results with other reits. nareit defines ebitdare as net income (calculated in accordance with gaap) excluding interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control), impairment write-downs of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustments to reflect the entity's pro rata share of ebitdare of unconsolidated affiliates.
we make additional adjustments to ebitdare when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitdare, when combined with the primary gaap presentation of net income, is beneficial to an investor's understanding of our operating performance. adjusted ebitdare also is similar to what is used in calculating certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. we adjust ebitdare for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as adjusted ebitdare:
•   property insurance gains - we exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in adjusted ebitdare is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. in addition, property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets.

•   cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle - infrequently, the fasb promulgates new accounting standards that require the consolidated statements of operations to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. we exclude these one-time adjustments because they do not reflect our actual performance for that period.

•   acquisition costs - under gaap, costs associated with completed property acquisitions are expensed in the year incurred. we exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company.

•   litigation gains and losses - we exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under gaap that we consider outside the ordinary course of business. we believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

69
in unusual circumstances, we also may adjust ebitdare for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the company's current operating performance. the last such adjustment was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.
in the past, we presented adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of our performance. that metric is calculated in a similar manner as adjusted ebitdare presented here, with the exception of the adjustment for non-controlling partners' pro rata share of adjusted ebitda, which totaled $11 million in 2016. the rationale for including 100% of ebitdare for consolidated affiliates with non-controlling interests is that the full amount of any debt of these affiliates is reported in our consolidated balance sheet and therefore metrics using total debt to ebitdare provide a better understanding of the company's leverage. this is also consistent with nareit's definition of ebitdare.

___________
(1)   net income, ebitda, ebitdare, adjusted ebitdare, nareit ffo and adjusted ffo include a gain of $2 million for each of the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 for the sale of the portion of land attributable to individual units sold by the maui timeshare joint venture and a gain of $4 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 for the sale of excess land in chicago.

(2)   reflects the sale of four hotels in 2017 and the sale of ten hotels in 2016.

(3)   represents our share of earnings from our european joint venture ("euro jv") in which we hold an approximate one-third non-controlling interest.

(4)   effective december 31, 2017, we present ebitdare, reported in accordance with nareit guidelines, and adjusted ebitdare as supplemental measures of our performance. our prior year results have been restated to conform with the current year presentation. under the new presentation, we include all of the ebitda of consolidated partnerships, including the non-controlling partners' share, which has increased the previously reported 2016 adjusted ebitda by $11 million.

nareit ffo, nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share. we present nareit ffo and nareit ffo per diluted share as non-gaap measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with gaap). we calculate nareit ffo per diluted share as our nareit ffo (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period, as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities, divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with nareit guidelines. nareit defines ffo as net income (calculated in accordance with gaap), excluding gains (losses) from sales of real estate, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, real estate-related depreciation, amortization and impairments and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the ffo of those entities on the same basis.
we believe that nareit ffo per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of nareit ffo per diluted share, when combined with the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share, provides beneficial information to investors. by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation, amortization, impairments and gains and losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance, we believe such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other
70
reits, even though nareit ffo per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. as noted by nareit in its april 2002 "white paper on funds from operations," since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. for these reasons, nareit adopted the ffo metric in order to promote an industry-wide measure of reit operating performance.
we also present adjusted ffo per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance, in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. we believe that the presentation of adjusted ffo per diluted share, when combined with both the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share and ffo per diluted share as defined by nareit, provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor's understanding of our operating performance. we adjust nareit ffo per diluted share for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as adjusted ffo per diluted share:
•   gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt - we exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt, including the acceleration of the write off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. we also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. we believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.

•   acquisition costs -under gaap, costs associated with completed property acquisitions are expensed in the year incurred. we exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company.

•   litigation gains and losses - we exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under gaap that we consider outside the ordinary course of business. we believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

in unusual circumstances, we also may adjust nareit ffo for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of our current operating performance. as a result of the reduction of corporate income tax rates from 35% to 21% caused by the tax cuts and jobs act, we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce the deferred tax assets and increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. additionally, similar corporate income tax rate reductions affected our european joint venture, causing the remeasurement of the net deferred tax assets and liabilities in france and belgium, resulting in a net tax benefit to us of $5 million. we do not consider these adjustments to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and therefore have excluded these items from adjusted ffo. the last such adjustment prior to this was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.

comparable hotel property level operating results. we present certain operating results for our hotels, such as hotel revenues, expenses, food and beverage profit and ebitda (and the related margins) on a comparable hotel, or "same store," basis as supplemental information for investors. our comparable hotel results present operating results for hotels owned during the entirety of the periods being compared without giving effect to any acquisitions or dispositions, significant property damage or large scale capital improvements incurred during these periods. we present comparable hotel ebitda to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable properties after removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense), and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). other corporate-level costs and expenses are also removed to arrive at property-level results. we believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information into the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels. we eliminate depreciation and amortization because, even though depreciation and amortization are property-level expenses, these non-cash expenses, which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets, implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. as noted earlier, because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient by themselves.
as a result of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses and depreciation and amortization, the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues, expenses, operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts, all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.
we present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel reits and hotel owners. in particular, these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors, such as the effect of acquisitions or dispositions. while management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a "same store" supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance, this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of these hotels, as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable hotel results. for these reasons, we believe that comparable hotel operating results, when combined with the presentation of gaap operating profit, revenues and expenses, provide useful information to investors and management.
the following table presents certain operating results and statistics for our comparable hotels for the periods presented herein:

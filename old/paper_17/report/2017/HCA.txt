item 1a.   risk factors

if any of the events discussed in the following risk factors were to occur, our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially, adversely affected. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known, or currently deemed immaterial, may also constrain our business and operations.
our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations.
we are highly leveraged. as of december 31, 2017, our total indebtedness was $33.058 billion. as of december 31, 2017, we had availability of $1.977 billion under our senior secured revolving credit facility and $70 million under our asset-based revolving credit facility, after giving effect to letters of credit and borrowing base limitations. our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including:
   increasing our vulnerability to downturns or adverse changes in general economic, industry or competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulations;

                             requiring a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;

   exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our unhedged borrowings are at variable rates of interest;

   limiting our ability to make strategic acquisitions or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures;

                          limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, product or service line development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and

   limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged.

we and our subsidiaries have the ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes. if new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms. if we are unable to do so, we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.
our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. we cannot assure you we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.
in addition, we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries. accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flows by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be
31
permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries.
we may find it necessary or prudent to refinance our outstanding indebtedness, the terms of which may not be favorable to us. our ability to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all, is directly affected by the then current global economic and financial conditions. in addition, our ability to incur secured indebtedness (which would generally enable us to achieve better pricing than the incurrence of unsecured indebtedness) depends in part on the value of our assets, which depends, in turn, on the strength of our cash flows and results of operations, and on economic and market conditions and other factors.
if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations or we are unable to refinance our indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure our indebtedness. these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. if our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. we may not be able to consummate those dispositions, or the proceeds from the dispositions may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.
our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.
our senior secured credit facilities and, to a lesser extent, the indentures governing our outstanding notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. these covenants limit our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to, among other things:
   incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;

   pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments;

   make certain investments;

   sell or transfer assets;

   create liens;

   consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and

   enter into certain transactions with our affiliates.

under our asset-based revolving credit facility, availability is subject to a borrowing base of 85% of eligible accounts receivable less customary reserves, with any reduction in the borrowing base commensurately reducing our ability to access this facility as a source of liquidity. in addition, under the asset-based revolving credit facility, when (and for as long as) the combined availability under our asset-based revolving credit facility and our senior secured revolving credit facility is less than a specified amount for a certain period of time or, if a payment or bankruptcy event of default has occurred and is continuing, funds deposited into any of our depository accounts will be transferred on a daily basis into a blocked account with the administrative agent and applied to prepay loans under the asset-based revolving credit facility and to collateralize letters of credit issued thereunder.
under our senior secured credit facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios. our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance we will continue to meet those ratios. a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under both the cash flow credit facility and the asset-based revolving credit facility. upon the occurrence of an
32
event of default under these senior secured credit facilities, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit, which would also result in an event of default under a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness. if we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. we have pledged a significant portion of our assets under our senior secured credit facilities and that collateral is also pledged as collateral under our first lien notes. if any of the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, there can be no assurance there will be sufficient assets to repay the senior secured credit facilities, the first lien notes and our other indebtedness.
our hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers.
the health care business is highly competitive, and competition among hospitals and other health care providers for patients has intensified in recent years. generally, other hospitals in the communities we serve provide services similar to those offered by our hospitals. in addition, cms publicizes on its hospital compare website performance data related to quality measures and data on patient satisfaction surveys hospitals submit in connection with their medicare reimbursement. federal law provides for the future expansion of the number of quality measures that must be reported. additional quality measures and future trends toward clinical transparency may have an unanticipated impact on our competitive position and patient volumes. further, every hospital must establish and update annually a public listing of the hospitals standard charges for items and services. if any of our hospitals achieve poor results (or results that are lower than our competitors) on these quality measures or on patient satisfaction surveys or if our standard charges are higher than our competitors, our patient volumes could decline.
in addition, the number of freestanding specialty hospitals, surgery centers, emergency departments, urgent care centers and diagnostic and imaging centers in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased. as a result, most of our hospitals operate in a highly competitive environment, which may put pressure on our pricing as high margin services transition to outpatient facilities and may also place pressure on the companys strategy for volume growth. some of the facilities that compete with our hospitals are physician-owned or are owned by governmental agencies or not-for-profit corporations supported by endowments, charitable contributions and/or tax revenues and can finance capital expenditures and operations on a tax-exempt basis. recent consolidations of not-for-profit hospital entities may intensify this competitive pressure. there is also increasing consolidation in the third-party payer industry, including vertical integration efforts among third-party payers and health care providers. health care industry participants are increasingly implementing physician alignment strategies, such as employing physicians, acquiring physician practice groups and participating in acos or other clinical integration models. other industry participants, such as large employer groups and their affiliates, may intensify competitive pressure and affect the industry in ways that are difficult to predict.
our hospitals compete with specialty hospitals and with both our own and unaffiliated freestanding surgery centers for market share in certain high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel. if ascs are better able to compete in this environment than our hospitals, our hospitals may experience a decline in patient volume, and we may experience a decrease in margin, even if those patients use our ascs. in states that do not require a con or other type of approval for the purchase, construction or expansion of health care facilities or services, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent. further, if our competitors are better able to attract patients, make capital expenditures and maintain modern and technologically upgraded facilities and equipment, recruit physicians, expand services or obtain favorable third-party payer contracts at their facilities than our hospitals and ascs, we may experience an overall decline in patient volume. see item 1, business  competition.
33
a deterioration in the collectability of uninsured and patient due accounts could adversely affect our results of operations.
the primary collection risks for our accounts receivable relate to the uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts for which the primary third-party payer has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (exclusions, deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. the provision for doubtful accounts relates primarily to amounts due directly from patients. medicare reimburses hospitals for 65% of eligible medicare bad debts. to be eligible for reimbursement, the amounts claimed must meet certain criteria, including that the debt is related to unpaid deductible or coinsurance amounts and that the hospital first attempted to collect the fees from the medicare beneficiary.
the amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon managements assessment of historical write-offs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal and state governmental and private employer health care coverage, the rate of growth in uninsured patient admissions and other collection indicators. at december 31, 2017, our allowance for doubtful accounts represented 100% of the $5.488 billion patient due accounts receivable balance. the sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care increased from $18.287 billion for 2015 to $20.455 billion for 2016 and to $23.420 billion for 2017.
any increase in the amount or deterioration in the collectability of uninsured accounts receivable will adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. our facilities may experience growth in bad debts, uninsured discounts and charity care as a result of a number of factors, including conditions impacting the overall economy and high unemployment. in 2017, congress eliminated the financial penalty associated with the health reform laws individual mandate, effective january 1, 2019, which may result in fewer individuals electing to purchase health insurance. the presidential administration and a number of members of congress continue to make other efforts to repeal or significantly change the health reform law. even if the health reform law remains in effect, we will continue to experience collectability issues and provide uninsured discounts and charity care for individuals residing in states that choose not to implement the medicaid expansion, for undocumented aliens who are not permitted to enroll in an exchange or government health care programs and for certain others who may not have insurance coverage. further, some patients may choose to enroll in lower cost medicaid plans or other health insurance plans with lower reimbursement levels. we may also be adversely affected by the growth in patient responsibility accounts as a result of increases in the adoption of health plan structures that shift greater responsibility for care to individuals through greater exclusions and copayment and deductible amounts.
changes in government health care programs may adversely affect our revenues.
a significant portion of our patient volume is derived from government health care programs, principally medicare and medicaid. specifically, we derived 41.8% of our revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs in 2017. changes in government health care programs may reduce the reimbursement we receive and could adversely affect our business and results of operations. the health reform law has made significant changes to medicare and medicaid, and future health reform efforts or efforts to repeal or significantly change the health reform law may impact these programs.
in recent years, legislative and regulatory changes have resulted in limitations on and, in some cases, reductions in levels of payments to health care providers for certain services under the medicare program. congress has established automatic spending reductions that extend through 2027. however, the percentage reduction for medicare may not be more than 2% for a fiscal year, with a uniform percentage reduction across all medicare programs. we are unable to predict what other deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by congress. these reductions are in addition to reductions mandated by the health reform law, which provides for material reductions in the growth of medicare program spending, including reductions in medicare market basket updates and medicare dsh funding. further, from time to time, cms revises the reimbursement systems used to reimburse health care providers, including changes to the ms-drg system and other payment systems,
34
which may result in reduced medicare payments. for example, under a site neutrality policy, certain items and services provided by off-campus provider-based departments that were formerly paid under the outpatient pps are now paid under the physician fee schedule, subject to certain exceptions.
because most states must operate with balanced budgets and because the medicaid program is often a states largest program, some states have enacted or may consider enacting legislation designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures. further, many states have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage, enroll medicaid recipients in managed care programs and/or impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the states medicaid systems. periods of economic weakness may increase the budgetary pressures on many states, and these budgetary pressures may result in decreased spending, or decreased spending growth, for medicaid programs and chip in many states. some states that provide medicaid supplemental payments are reviewing these programs or have filed waiver requests with cms to replace these programs, and cms has performed and continues to perform compliance reviews of some states programs, which could result in medicaid supplemental payments being reduced or eliminated. for example, in december 2017, cms announced that it will phase out funding for designated state health programs under certain types of medicaid waivers. further, legislation and administrative actions at the federal level may significantly alter the funding for, or structure of, the medicaid program. for example, from time to time, congress considers proposals to restructure the medicaid program to involve block grants that would be administered by the states.
in some cases, private third-party payers rely on all or portions of medicare payment systems to determine payment rates. changes to government health care programs that reduce payments under these programs may negatively impact payments from private third-party payers.
current or future health care reform and deficit reduction efforts, changes in laws or regulations regarding government health care programs, other changes in the administration of government health care programs and changes by private third-party payers in response to health care reform and other changes to government health care programs could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.
our results of operations may be adversely affected by health care reform efforts, particularly efforts to repeal, replace or otherwise significantly change the health reform law. we are unable to predict what, if any, and when such changes will be made in the future.
the health reform law represents a significant shift in the way health care services are delivered, covered, and reimbursed. although it reduced our medicare and medicaid reimbursement, the health reform law also reduced the number of uninsured patients to whom we provide health care services, primarily through the exchanges and medicaid expansion. however, many insurers have exited the exchanges in the markets served by the company. to the extent some markets lack a sufficient number of health insurers participating in the exchanges, it could threaten the continued viability of the exchanges in those markets.
in addition, the presidential administration and a number of members of congress continue to attempt to repeal, amend or replace the law, or make significant changes to its implementation. in 2017, congress eliminated the financial penalty associated with the individual mandate, effective january 1, 2019. it is difficult to predict the impact of this change, but it may result in fewer individuals electing to purchase health insurance. further, the president of the united states has also signed an executive order that directs agencies to minimize economic and regulatory burdens of the health reform law, which may result in additional changes in how the law is implemented. cms has indicated that it intends to increase flexibility in state medicaid programs, including by expanding the scope of waivers under which states may implement medicaid expansion provisions, impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions, or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards. there is uncertainty regarding whether, when, and how the health reform law may be further changed. changes by congress or government agencies could eliminate or alter provisions beneficial to us, and it is difficult to predict the impact of changes on other health care industry participants. government efforts to repeal or change the health reform law may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources, and liquidity.
35
if our volume of patients with private health insurance coverage declines or we are unable to retain and negotiate favorable contracts with private third-party payers, including managed care plans, our revenues may be reduced.
private third-party payers, including hmos, ppos and other managed care plans, typically reimburse health care providers at a higher rate than medicare, medicaid or other government health care programs. reimbursement rates are set forth by contract when our facilities are in-network, and payers utilize plan structures to encourage or require the use of in-network providers. revenues derived from private third-party payers (domestic only) accounted for 56.9%, 56.5% and 55.2% of our revenues for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. as a result, our ability to maintain or increase patient volumes covered by private third-party payers and to maintain and obtain favorable contracts with private third-party payers significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our facilities.
private third-party payers, including managed care plans, continue to demand discounted fee structures, and the trend toward consolidation among payers tends to increase their bargaining power over fee structures. payers may utilize plan structures such as narrow networks and tiered networks that limit beneficiary provider choices or impose significantly higher cost sharing obligations when care is obtained from providers in a disfavored tier. other health care providers may impact our ability to enter into managed care contracts or negotiate increases in our reimbursement and other favorable terms and conditions. for example, some of our competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise restrict the ability of managed care plans to contract with us. in addition to increasing negotiating leverage of private third-party payers, alignment efforts between third-party payers and health care providers may also result in other competitive advantages, such as greater access to performance and pricing data. our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to retain and renew our third-party payer contracts and enter into new contracts on terms favorable to us. cost-reduction strategies by large employer groups and their affiliates may also limit our ability to negotiate favorable terms in our contracts and otherwise intensify competitive pressure. it is not clear what impact, if any, future health reform efforts or the repeal of, or changes to, the health reform law will have on our ability to negotiate reimbursement increases and participate in third-party payer networks on favorable terms. if we are unable to retain and negotiate favorable contracts with third-party payers or experience reductions in payment increases or amounts received from third-party payers, our revenues may be reduced.
our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians.
the success of our hospitals depends in part on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals, the admitting and utilization practices of those physicians, maintaining good relations with those physicians and controlling costs related to the employment of physicians. although we employ some physicians, physicians are often not employees of the hospitals at which they practice, and, in many of the markets we serve, most physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals. such physicians may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time. we may face increased challenges in this area as the physician population reaches retirement age, especially if there is a shortage of physicians willing and able to provide comparable services. if we are unable to provide adequate support personnel or technologically advanced equipment and hospital facilities that meet the needs of those physicians and their patients, they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities, admissions may decrease and our operating performance may decline.
our hospitals face competition for staffing, which may increase labor costs and reduce profitability.
our operations are dependent on the efforts, abilities and experience of our management and medical support personnel, such as nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians, as well as our physicians. we compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified management and support personnel responsible for the daily operations of each of our hospitals, including nurses and other nonphysician health care professionals. in some markets, the availability of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a
36
significant operating issue to health care providers. we may be required to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. as a result, our labor costs could increase. we also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate. certain proposed changes in federal labor laws and the nlrbs modification of its election procedures could increase the likelihood of employee unionization attempts. to the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, it is possible our labor costs could increase materially. when negotiating collective bargaining agreements with unions, whether such agreements are renewals or first contracts, there is the possibility that strikes could occur during the negotiation process, and our continued operation during any strikes could increase our labor costs. in addition, the states in which we operate could adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse staffing ratios already in place. state-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit admissions in order to meet the required ratios. if our labor costs increase, we may not be able to raise rates to offset these increased costs. because a significant percentage of our revenues consists of fixed, prospective payments, our ability to pass along increased labor costs is constrained. our failure to recruit and retain qualified management, nurses and other medical support personnel, or to control labor costs, could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations.
we may be unable to attract, hire, and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce, including key management.
the talents and efforts of our employees, particularly our key management, are vital to our success. our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. in addition, institutional knowledge may be lost in any potential managerial transition. we may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the labor market. failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent, or failure to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team, could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success.
if we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.
the health care industry is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels relating to, among other things:
   billing and coding for services and properly handling overpayments;

   appropriateness and classification of level of care provided, including proper classification of inpatient admissions, observation services and outpatient care;

   relationships with physicians and other referral sources and referral recipients;

   necessity and adequacy of medical care;

   quality of medical equipment and services;

   qualifications of medical and support personnel;

   confidentiality, maintenance, data breach, identity theft and security issues associated with health-related and personal information and medical records;

   screening, stabilization and transfer of individuals who have emergency medical conditions;

   licensure, certification and enrollment with government programs;

   hospital rate or budget review;

   debt collection;

37
   communications with patients and consumers;

   preparing and filing of cost reports;

   operating policies and procedures;

   activities regarding competitors;

   addition of facilities and services; and

   environmental protection.

among these laws are the federal anti-kickback statute, the federal stark law, the fca and similar state laws. we have a variety of financial relationships with physicians and others who either refer or influence the referral of patients to our hospitals, other health care facilities and employed physicians or who are the recipients of referrals, and these laws govern those relationships. the oig has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices deemed protected from prosecution under the anti-kickback statute. while we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors, certain of our current arrangements, including joint ventures and financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources and persons and entities to which we refer patients, do not qualify for safe harbor protection. failure to qualify for a safe harbor does not mean the arrangement necessarily violates the anti-kickback statute but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny. however, we cannot offer assurance that practices outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the anti-kickback statute. allegations of violations of the anti-kickback statute may be brought under the federal civil monetary penalty law, which requires a lower burden of proof than other fraud and abuse laws, including the anti-kickback statute.
our financial relationships with referring physicians and their immediate family members must comply with the stark law by meeting an exception. we attempt to structure our relationships to meet an exception to the stark law, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex, and we cannot provide assurance that every relationship complies fully with the stark law. unlike the anti-kickback statute, failure to meet an exception under the stark law results in a violation of the stark law, even if such violation is technical in nature.
additionally, if we violate the anti-kickback statute or stark law, or if we improperly bill for our services, we may be found to violate the fca, either under a suit brought by the government or by a private person under a qui tam, or whistleblower, suit. see item 1, business  regulation and other factors.
we also operate health care facilities in the united kingdom and have operations and commercial relationships with companies in other foreign jurisdictions and, as a result, are subject to certain u.s. and foreign laws applicable to businesses generally, including anti-corruption laws. the foreign corrupt practices act regulates u.s. companies in their dealings with foreign officials, prohibiting bribes and similar practices, and requires that they maintain records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and appropriate internal accounting controls. in addition, the united kingdom bribery act has wide jurisdiction over certain activities that affect the united kingdom.
a variety of state, national, foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data. many foreign data privacy regulations (including the general data protection regulation (gdpr), which becomes effective in the european union on may 25, 2018) are more stringent than those in the united states. these laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and changing, and could have an adverse effect on our operations. companies obligations and requirements under these laws and regulations are subject to uncertainty in how they may be interpreted by government authorities and regulators. the costs of compliance with, and the other burdens imposed by, these and other laws or regulatory actions may increase our operational costs, result in interruptions or delays in the availability of systems and/or result in a patient volume decline. in the case of non-compliance with a material provision of the gdpr (such as non-adherence to the core principles of processing personal data), regulators
38
have the authority to levy a fine in an amount that is up to the greater of 20 million or 4% of global annual turnover in the prior year. if it is determined that non-compliance is related to a non-material provision (such as failure to comply with technical measures), regulators may impose a fine in an amount that is up to the greater of 10 million or 2% of the global annual turnover from the prior year. these administrative fines are discretionary and based, in each case, on a multi-factored approach. we may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations. an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could result in liability, result in adverse publicity, and adversely affect our business.
we engage in consumer debt collection for hca-affiliated hospitals and certain non-affiliated hospitals. the federal fair debt collection practices act and telephone consumer protection act restrict the methods that companies may use to contact and seek payment from consumer debtors regarding past due accounts. many states impose additional requirements on debt collection practices, and some of those requirements may be more stringent than the federal requirements.
if we fail to comply with these or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to liabilities, including civil penalties, the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities, exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the medicare, medicaid and other federal and state health care programs and criminal penalties.
we do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations. in the future, different interpretations or enforcement of, or amendment to, these or other laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. a determination that we have violated these or other laws, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of these or other laws, could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects, and our business reputation could suffer significantly. in addition, other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level may be adopted that adversely affect our business.
we have been and could become the subject of government investigations, claims and litigation.
health care companies are subject to numerous investigations by various government agencies. further, under the fca, private parties have the right to bring qui tam, or whistleblower, suits against companies that submit false claims for payments to, or improperly retain overpayments from, the government. some states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions. certain of our individual facilities have received, and other facilities may receive, government inquiries from, and may be subject to investigation by, federal and state agencies. depending on whether the underlying conduct in these or future inquiries or investigations could be considered systemic, their resolution could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
government agencies and their agents, such as the macs, fiscal intermediaries and carriers, as well as the oig, cms and state medicaid programs, conduct audits of our health care operations. private third-party payers may conduct similar post-payment audits, and we also perform internal audits and monitoring. depending on the nature of the conduct found in such audits and whether the underlying conduct could be considered systemic, the resolution of these audits could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
cms contracts with racs on a contingency fee basis to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in the fee-for-service medicare program. the health reform law expanded the rac programs scope to include managed medicare plans and medicaid claims. rac denials are appealable; however, there are currently significant delays in the assignment of new medicare appeals to administrative law
39
judges, which negatively impacts our ability to appeal rac payment denials. in addition, cms employs mics to perform post-payment audits of medicaid claims and identify overpayments, and state medicaid agencies and other contractors have increased their review activities.
should we be found out of compliance with any of these laws, regulations or programs, depending on the nature of the findings, our business, our financial position and our results of operations could be negatively impacted.
changes to physician utilization practices and treatment methodologies, third-party payer controls designed to reduce inpatient services or surgical procedures and other factors outside our control that impact demand for medical services may reduce our revenues.
controls imposed by medicare, managed medicare, medicaid, managed medicaid and private third-party payers designed to reduce admissions, intensity of services, surgical volumes and lengths of stay, in some instances referred to as utilization review, have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities. utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by third-party payers. the medicare program also issues national or local coverage determinations that restrict the circumstances under which medicare pays for certain services. inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by third-party payers preadmission authorization requirements, coverage restrictions, utilization review and by pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients. efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue. additionally, trends in physician treatment protocols and managed care health plan design, such as health plans that shift increased costs and accountability for care to patients, could reduce our surgical volumes and admissions in favor of lower intensity and lower cost treatment methodologies.
volume, admission and case-mix trends may be impacted by other factors beyond our control, such as changes in volume of certain high acuity services, variations in the prevalence and severity of outbreaks of influenza and other illnesses and medical conditions, seasonal and severe weather conditions, changes in treatment regimens and medical technology and other advances. these factors may reduce the demand for services we offer and decrease the reimbursement that we receive. significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed, cost controls, changes to physician utilization practices, treatment methodologies, reimbursement rates and fees and other factors beyond our control could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
our overall business results may suffer during periods of general economic weakness.
budget deficits at federal, state and local government entities have had a negative impact on spending, and may continue to negatively impact spending, for health and human service programs, including medicare, medicaid and similar programs, which represent significant third-party payer sources for our hospitals. we anticipate that the federal deficit, the growing magnitude of medicare expenditures and the aging of the united states population will continue to place pressure on government health care programs. other risks we face during periods of economic weakness and high unemployment include potential declines in the population covered under managed care agreements, increased patient decisions to postpone or cancel elective and nonemergency health care procedures (including delaying surgical procedures), potential increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations, increased adoption of health plan structures that shift financial responsibility to patients and further difficulties in collecting patient receivables for copayment and deductible receivables.
the industry trend toward value-based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues.
there is a trend in the health care industry toward value-based purchasing of health care services. these value-based purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities. governmental programs including medicare currently require hospitals to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates. in addition,

medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events (also called never events). the health reform law also prohibits the use of federal funds under the medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat hacs. the 25% of hospitals with the worst risk-adjusted hac rates in the designated performance period receive a 1% reduction in their inpatient pps medicare payments.
hospitals with excess readmission rates for conditions designated by hhs will receive a reduction in their inpatient pps operating medicare payments for all medicare inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excess readmission standard. the reduction in payments to hospitals with excess readmissions can be up to 3% of a hospitals base payments.
hhs has implemented a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services that reduces inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by 2% in federal fiscal year 2017 and for subsequent years. hhs pools the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards established by hhs. hhs estimates that $1.9 billion in value-based incentive payments will be available to hospitals in federal fiscal year 2018 based on achievement (relative to other hospitals) and improvement (relative to the hospitals own past performance). hospitals that meet or exceed the quality performance standards will receive greater reimbursement under the value-based purchasing program than they would have otherwise.
cms has developed several alternative payment models that are intended to reduce costs and improve quality of care for medicare beneficiaries. examples of alternative payment models include bundled payment models in which, depending on whether overall cms spending per episode exceeds or falls below a target specified by cms and whether quality standards are met, hospitals may receive supplemental medicare payments or owe repayments to cms. generally, participation in bundled payment programs is voluntary, but cms requires hospitals in selected markets to participate in a bundled payment initiative for orthopedic services. participation in mandatory or voluntary demonstration projects, particularly demonstrations with the potential to affect payment, may negatively impact our results of operations.
many large private third-party payers currently require hospitals to report quality data, and several private third-party payers do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events. further, we have implemented a policy pursuant to which we do not bill patients or third-party payers for fees or expenses incurred due to certain preventable adverse events.
we expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts. cms has announced aggressive goals for adopting alternative payment models, which may include additional bundled payment programs, and private third-party payers may also transition away from fee-for-service payment models. we are unable at this time to predict our future payments or whether we will be subject to payment reductions under these programs or how this trend will affect our results of operations, but it could negatively impact our revenues.
our operations could be impaired by a failure of our information systems.
the performance of our information systems is critical to our business operations. in addition to our shared services initiatives, our information systems are essential to a number of critical areas of our operations, including:
   accounting and financial reporting;

   billing and collecting accounts;

   coding and compliance;

   clinical systems;

   medical records and document storage;

41
   inventory management;

   negotiating, pricing and administering managed care contracts and supply contracts; and

   monitoring quality of care and collecting data on quality measures necessary for full medicare payment updates.

information systems may be vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, human acts and natural disasters. we have taken precautionary measures to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our information systems. nevertheless, we may experience system failures. the occurrence of any system failure could result in interruptions, delays, the loss or corruption of data and cessations or interruptions in the availability of systems, all of which could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and harm our business reputation.
a cybersecurity incident could result in the compromise of a facility, confidential data or critical data systems and give rise to potential harm to patients, remediation and other expenses, expose us to liability under hipaa, consumer protection laws, or other common law theories, subject us to litigation and foreign, federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business.
we, independently and through third-party vendors, collect and store on our networks sensitive information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our patients and employees. in addition, we have made significant investments in technology to adopt and utilize ehr and to become meaningful users of health information technology. the secure maintenance of this information and technology is critical to our business operations. we have implemented multiple layers of security measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of this data and the systems and devices that store and transmit such data. we utilize current security technologies, and our defenses are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties. despite these efforts, threats from malicious persons and groups, new vulnerabilities and advanced new attacks against information systems create risk of cybersecurity incidents. we are regularly the target of attempted cybersecurity and other threats that could have a security impact. there can be no assurance that we or our third-party vendors will not be subject to cybersecurity incidents that bypass our security measures, impact the integrity, availability or privacy of personal health information or other data subject to privacy laws or disrupt our information systems, devices or business, including our ability to provide various health care services. as a result, cybersecurity, physical security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our facilities, information systems and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. as cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities. the occurrence of any of these events could result in (i) harm to patients; (ii) business interruptions and delays; (iii) the loss, misappropriation, corruption or unauthorized access of data; (iv) litigation and potential liability under privacy, security and consumer protection laws or other applicable laws; (v) reputational damage and (vi) foreign, federal and state governmental inquiries, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and harm our business reputation.
if we fail to continue to demonstrate meaningful use of certified electronic health record systems, our operations could be adversely affected.
eligible hospitals and eligible professionals that fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified ehr technology in an applicable prior reporting period are subject to reduced payments from medicare. failure to continue to demonstrate meaningful use of certified ehr technology could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.
the emergence and effects related to a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease could adversely affect our operations.
if a pandemic, epidemic, outbreak of an infectious disease or other public health crisis were to occur in an area in which we operate, our operations could be adversely affected. such a crisis could diminish the public trust
42
in health care facilities, especially hospitals that fail to accurately or timely diagnose, or are treating (or have treated) patients affected by infectious diseases. if any of our facilities were involved, or perceived as being involved, in treating patients from such an infectious disease, patients might cancel elective procedures or fail to seek needed care at our facilities. further, a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak might adversely affect our operations by causing a temporary shutdown or diversion of patients, by disrupting or delaying production and delivery of materials and products in the supply chain or by causing staffing shortages in our facilities. we have disaster plans in place and operate pursuant to infectious disease protocols, but the potential emergence of a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak is difficult to predict and could adversely affect our operations.
state efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care facilities could impair our ability to operate and expand our operations.
some states, particularly in the eastern part of the country, require health care providers to obtain prior approval, often known as a con, for the purchase, construction or expansion of health care facilities, to make certain capital expenditures or to make changes in services or bed capacity. in giving approval, these states consider the need for additional or expanded health care facilities or services. we currently operate health care facilities in a number of states with con laws or that require other types of approvals for the establishment or expansion of certain facility types or services. the failure to obtain any required con or other required approval could impair our ability to operate or expand operations. any such failure could, in turn, adversely affect our ability to attract patients and physicians to our facilities and grow our revenues, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
we may encounter difficulty acquiring hospitals and other health care businesses, encounter challenges integrating the operations of acquired hospitals and other health care businesses and become liable for unknown or contingent liabilities as a result of acquisitions.
a component of our business strategy is acquiring hospitals and other health care businesses. we may encounter difficulty acquiring new facilities or other businesses as a result of competition from other purchasers that may be willing to pay purchase prices that are higher than we believe are reasonable. some states require cons in order to acquire a hospital or other facility or to expand facilities or services. in addition, the acquisition of health care facilities often involves licensure approvals or reviews and complex change of ownership processes for medicare and other payers. further, many states have laws that restrict the conversion or sale of not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities. these laws may require prior approval from the state attorney general, advance notification of the attorney general or other regulators and community involvement. attorneys general in states without specific requirements may exercise broad discretionary authority over transactions involving the sale of not-for-profits under their general obligations to protect the use of charitable assets. these conversion legislative and administrative efforts often focus on the appropriate valuation of the assets divested and the use of the proceeds of the sale by the non-profit seller and may include consideration of commitments for capital improvements and charity care by the purchaser. also, the increasingly challenging regulatory and enforcement environment may negatively impact our ability to acquire health care businesses if they are found to have material unresolved compliance issues, such as repayment obligations. resolving compliance issues as well as completion of oversight, review or approval processes could seriously delay or even prevent our ability to acquire hospitals or other businesses and increase our acquisition costs.
we may be unable to timely and effectively integrate hospitals and other businesses that we acquire with our ongoing operations, or we may experience delays implementing operating procedures and systems. hospitals and other health care businesses that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including liabilities for failure to comply with health care and other laws and regulations, medical and general professional liabilities, workers compensation liabilities and tax liabilities. although we typically exclude significant liabilities from our acquisition transactions and seek indemnification from the sellers for these matters, we could experience difficulty enforcing those obligations, experience liability in excess of any indemnification obtained or otherwise incur material liabilities for the pre-acquisition conduct of acquired businesses. such liabilities and related legal or other costs could harm our business and results of operations.
43
our facilities are heavily concentrated in florida and texas, which makes us sensitive to regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive conditions and changes in those states.
we operated 179 hospitals at december 31, 2017, and 91 of those hospitals are located in florida and texas. our florida and texas facilities combined revenues represented approximately 48% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017. this concentration makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive conditions and changes in those states. any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in those states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results.
in addition, our hospitals in florida, texas and other coastal states are located in hurricane-prone areas. in the past, hurricanes have had a disruptive effect on the operations of our hospitals in florida, texas and other coastal states and the patient populations in those states. our business activities could be harmed by a particularly active hurricane season or even a single storm, and the property insurance we obtain may not be adequate to cover losses from future hurricanes or other natural disasters.
we may be subject to liabilities from claims by taxing authorities.
we are subject to examination by federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. management believes hca healthcare, inc., its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with the irs, state and foreign taxing authorities and final resolution of any disputes will not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. however, if payments due upon final resolution of any issues exceed our recorded estimates, such resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.
we may be subject to liabilities from claims brought against our facilities.
we are subject to litigation relating to our business practices, including claims and legal actions by patients and others in the ordinary course of business alleging malpractice, product liability or other legal theories. many of these actions seek large sums of money as damages and involve significant defense costs. we insure a portion of our professional liability risks through a 100% owned subsidiary. management believes our reserves for self-insured retentions and insurance coverage are sufficient to cover insured claims arising out of the operation of our facilities. our 100% owned liability insurance subsidiary has entered into certain reinsurance contracts; however, the subsidiary remains liable to the extent that the reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the reinsurance contracts. if payments for claims exceed actuarially determined estimates, are not covered by insurance, or reinsurers, if any, fail to meet their obligations, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in the market values of securities and interest rate changes.
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. the investment securities of our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries were $472 million at december 31, 2017. these investments are carried at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. at december 31, 2017, we had a net unrealized gain of $10 million on the insurance subsidiaries investment securities.
we are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. investment securities of our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. should the 100% owned insurance subsidiaries require significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a normal market environment. we may be required to recognize other-than-temporary impairments on long-term investments in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue specific factors.
we are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, and we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. our interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on common
44
notional principal amounts and maturity dates. the notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities.
there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends.
in january 2018, the board of directors initiated a cash dividend program under which the company expects to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend. the board declared the first quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per share of common stock to be paid to stockholders of record as of the close of business on march 1, 2018, with a payment date of march 30, 2018. the declaration, amount and timing of such dividends are subject to capital availability and determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and our agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends. our ability to pay dividends will depend upon, among other factors, our cash flows from operations, our available capital and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions, debt service requirements, share repurchases and investing in our existing markets as well as our results of operations, financial condition and other factors beyond our control that our board of directors may deem relevant. a reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price.
uncertainties in the interpretation and application of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate.
the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act (the tax act) was enacted on december 22, 2017. the tax act significantly revises u.s. corporate income taxes, including lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018 and imposing a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed foreign earnings. due to the complexity and uncertainty regarding numerous provisions of the tax act, we have not completed our accounting for its effects. however, we have made reasonable estimates and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of december 31, 2017.
as we complete our analysis of the tax act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance issued by federal and state taxing authorities or other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts and record additional amounts for those federal, state, and foreign tax assets and liabilities for which we were unable to make reasonable estimates as of december 31, 2017. any adjustments or additional amounts recorded may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the periods in which they are made.
certain of our investors may continue to have influence over us.
on november 17, 2006, hca inc. was acquired by a private investor group, including affiliates of hca founder, dr. thomas f. frist, jr. and certain other investors. through their investment in hercules holding ii and other holdings, certain of the frist-affiliated investors continue to hold a significant interest in our outstanding common stock (approximately 20% as of january 31, 2018). in addition, pursuant to a shareholders agreement we entered into with hercules holding ii and the frist-affiliated investors, certain representatives of these investors have the continued right to nominate certain of the members of our board of directors. as a result, certain of these investors potentially have the ability to influence our decisions to enter into corporate transactions (and the terms thereof) and prevent changes in the composition of our board of directors and any transaction that requires stockholder approval.

2017 operations summary net income attributable to hca healthcare, inc. totaled $2.216 billion, or $5.95 per diluted share, for 2017, compared to $2.890 billion, or $7.30 per diluted share, for 2016. the 2017 results include additional expenses and losses of revenues estimated at approximately $140 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, associated with the impact of hurricanes harvey and irma on our texas, florida, georgia and south carolina facilities and an increase in provision for income taxes of $301 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the enactment of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act. the amount associated with the hurricanes is prior to any insurance recoveries which we may receive. the 2017 results also include net gains on sales of facilities of $8 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, and losses on retirement of debt of $39 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. the 2016 results include net gains on sales of facilities of $23 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, losses on retirement of debt of $4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, and legal claim benefits of $246 million, or $0.39 per diluted share. our provisions for income taxes for 2017 and 2016 included tax benefits of $82 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, and $162 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, respectively, related to employee equity award settlements. our provision for income taxes for 2016 also included tax benefits of $51 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, primarily related to the resolution of federal income tax issues for our 2011 and 2012 tax years. all per diluted share disclosures are based upon amounts net of the applicable income taxes. shares used for diluted earnings per share were 372.221 million shares and 395.851 million shares for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. during 2017 and 2016, we repurchased 25.092 million and 36.325 million shares, respectively, of our common stock.
revenues increased to $43.614 billion for 2017 from $41.490 billion for 2016. revenues increased 5.1% and 3.8%, respectively, on a consolidated basis and on a same facility basis for 2017, compared to 2016. the consolidated revenues increase can be attributed to the combined impact of a 2.1% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 3.0% increase in equivalent admissions. the same facility revenues increase resulted from a 2.2% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.5% increase in same facility equivalent admissions.
during 2017, consolidated admissions increased 2.4% and same facility admissions increased 1.1%, compared to 2016. inpatient surgical volumes increased 1.7% on a consolidated basis and increased 0.3% on a same facility basis during 2017, compared to 2016. outpatient surgical volumes increased 0.3% on a consolidated basis and declined 1.3% on a same facility basis during 2017, compared to 2016. emergency room visits increased 2.9% on a consolidated basis and increased 1.4% on a same facility basis during 2017, compared to 2016.
for 2017, the provision for doubtful accounts increased $782 million, compared to 2016. the self-pay revenue deductions for charity care and uninsured discounts increased $710 million and $1.473 billion, respectively, for 2017, compared to 2016. the sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts

2017 operations summary  (continued)
and charity care, as a percentage of the sum of revenues, the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, was 34.9% for 2017, compared to 33.0% for 2016. same facility uninsured admissions increased 5.9% and same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 2.4% for 2017, compared to 2016. same facility uninsured admissions increased 3.8% and same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 4.5% for 2016, compared to 2015.
interest expense totaled $1.690 billion for 2017, compared to $1.707 billion for 2016. the $17 million decline in interest expense for 2017 was due to the decline in the average interest rate.
cash flows from operating activities declined $227 million, from $5.653 billion for 2016 to $5.426 billion for 2017. the decline in cash flows from operating activities was primarily related to the net impact of the decline of net income of $689 million, offset by positive changes related to depreciation and amortization of $165 million and income taxes of $310 million.
business strategy we are committed to providing the communities we serve with high quality, cost-effective health care while growing our business, increasing our profitability and creating long-term value for our stockholders. to achieve these objectives, we align our efforts around the following growth agenda:
grow our presence in existing markets. we believe we are well positioned in a number of large and growing markets that will allow us the opportunity to generate long-term, attractive growth through the expansion of our presence in these markets. we plan to continue recruiting and strategically collaborating with the physician community and adding attractive service lines such as cardiology, emergency services, oncology and womens services. additional components of our growth strategy include expanding our footprint through developing various outpatient access points, including surgery centers, urgent care clinics, freestanding emergency care facilities and walk-in clinics.
achieve industry-leading performance in clinical and satisfaction measures. achieving high levels of patient safety, patient satisfaction and clinical quality are central goals of our business model. to achieve these goals, we have implemented a number of initiatives including infection reduction initiatives, hospitalist programs, advanced health information technology and evidence-based medicine programs. we routinely analyze operational practices from our best-performing hospitals to identify ways to implement organization-wide performance improvements and reduce clinical variation. we believe these initiatives will continue to improve patient care, help us achieve cost efficiencies, grow our revenues and favorably position us in an environment where our constituents are increasingly focused on quality, efficacy and efficiency.
recruit and employ physicians to meet the needs for high quality health services. we depend on the quality and dedication of the health care providers and other team members who serve at our facilities. we believe a critical component of our growth strategy is our ability to successfully recruit and strategically collaborate with physicians and other professionals to provide high quality care. we attract and retain physicians by providing high quality, convenient facilities with advanced technology, by expanding our specialty services and by building our outpatient operations. we believe our continued investment in the employment, recruitment and retention of physicians will improve the quality of care at our facilities.
54
hca healthcare, inc.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
business strategy (continued)
continue to leverage our scale and market positions to enhance profitability. we believe there is significant opportunity to continue to grow the profitability of our company by fully leveraging the scale and scope of our franchise. we are currently investing in initiatives such as additional care navigators, clinical data exchange and centralized patient transfer operations, which will enable us to improve coordination of care and patient retention across our markets. we believe our centrally managed business processes and ability to leverage cost-saving practices across our extensive network will enable us to continue to manage costs effectively. we continue to invest in our parallon subsidiary group to leverage key components of our support infrastructure, including revenue cycle management, health care group purchasing, supply chain management and staffing functions.
pursue a disciplined development strategy. we continue to believe there are significant growth opportunities in our markets. we will continue to provide financial and operational resources to analyze and develop our in-market opportunities. to complement our in-market growth agenda, we intend to focus on selectively developing and acquiring new hospitals, outpatient facilities and other health care service providers. we believe the challenges faced by the hospital industry may continue to spur consolidation and we believe our size, scale, national presence and access to capital will position us well to participate in any such consolidation. we have a strong record of successfully acquiring and integrating hospitals and entering into joint ventures and intend to continue leveraging this experience.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes known. actual results may differ from these estimates.
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenues revenues are recorded during the period the health care services are provided, based upon the estimated amounts due from payers. estimates of contractual allowances under managed care health plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation. the estimated reimbursement amounts are made on a payer-specific basis and are recorded based on the best information available regarding managements interpretation of the applicable laws, regulations and contract terms. management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals. we have invested significant resources to refine and improve our billing systems and the information system data used to make contractual allowance estimates. we have developed standardized calculation processes and related employee training programs to improve the utility of our patient accounting systems.
the emergency medical treatment and labor act (emtala) requires any hospital participating in the medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the
55
hca healthcare, inc.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
critical accounting policies and estimates (continued)
revenues (continued)
hospitals emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition. the obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individuals ability to pay for treatment. federal and state laws and regulations, including but not limited to emtala, require, and our commitment to providing quality patient care encourages, the provision of services to patients who are financially unable to pay for the health care services they receive.
we do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who meet our guidelines to qualify for charity care; therefore, these amounts are not reported in revenues. we provide discounts from our gross charges to uninsured amounts related to patients who do not qualify for medicaid or charity care. after the discounts are applied, we are still unable to collect a significant portion of uninsured patients accounts, and we record significant provisions for doubtful accounts (based upon our historical collection experience) related to uninsured patients in the period the services are provided.
due to the complexities involved in the classification and documentation of health care services authorized and provided, the estimation of revenues earned and the related reimbursement are often subject to interpretations that could result in payments that are different from our estimates. adjustments to estimated medicare and medicaid reimbursement amounts and disproportionate-share funds, which resulted in net increases to revenues, related primarily to cost reports filed during the respective year were $41 million, $31 million and $48 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the adjustments to estimated reimbursement amounts, which resulted in net increases to revenues, related primarily to cost reports filed during previous years were $56 million, $90 million and $85 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we expect adjustments during the next 12 months related to medicare and medicaid cost report filings and settlements will result in increases to revenues generally similar to the amounts recorded during these years.
provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts the collection of outstanding receivables from medicare, medicaid, managed care payers, other third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. the primary collection risks relate to uninsured patient accounts, including patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. the provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the aging of those accounts. accounts are written off when all reasonable internal and external collection efforts have been performed. our collection policies include a review of all accounts against certain standard collection criteria, upon completion of our primary internal collection efforts. accounts determined to possess positive collectibility attributes are forwarded to a secondary internal or external collection agency and the other accounts are written off. the accounts that are not collected by the secondary collection agency are written off when secondary collection efforts are completed (usually within 12 months). writeoffs are based upon specific identification and the writeoff process requires a writeoff adjustment entry to the patient accounting system. we do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients that meet our guidelines to qualify as charity care.
the amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon managements assessment of historical writeoffs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state, and private

employer health care coverage and other collection indicators. management relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical writeoffs and recoveries at facilities that represent a majority of our revenues and accounts receivable (the hindsight analysis) as a primary source of information in estimating the collectibility of our accounts receivable. we perform the hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months accounts receivable collection and writeoff data. we believe our quarterly updates to the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts at each of our hospital facilities provide reasonable valuations of our accounts receivable. these routine, quarterly changes in estimates have not resulted in material adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts, provision for doubtful accounts or period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations. at december 31, 2017 and 2016, the allowance for doubtful accounts represented 100% of the $5.488 billion and 98% of the $5.116 billion, respectively, patient due accounts receivable balance. the patient due accounts receivable balance represents the estimated uninsured portion of our accounts receivable. the estimated uninsured portion of medicaid pending and uninsured discount pending accounts is included in our patient due accounts receivable balance.
to quantify the total impact of and trends related to uninsured accounts, we believe it is beneficial to view the revenue deductions related to uninsured accounts (charity care and uninsured discounts) and provision for doubtful accounts in combination, rather than each separately. a summary of these amounts for the years ended december 31, follows (dollars in millions):

professional liability claims we, along with virtually all health care providers, operate in an environment with professional liability risks. our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence, subject to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention. the insurance subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally above a retention level of $25 million per occurrence. we purchase excess insurance on a claims-made basis for losses in excess of $50 million per occurrence. provisions for losses related to professional liability risks were $466 million, $430 million and $344 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
reserves for professional liability risks represent the estimated ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through the respective consolidated balance sheet dates. the estimated ultimate cost includes estimates of direct expenses and fees paid to outside counsel and experts, but does not include the general overhead costs of our insurance subsidiary or corporate office. individual case reserves are established based upon the particular circumstances of each reported claim and represent our estimates of the future costs that will be paid on reported claims. case reserves are reduced as claim payments are made and are adjusted upward or downward as our estimates regarding the amounts of future losses are revised. once the case reserves for known claims are determined, information is stratified by loss layers and retentions, accident years, reported years, and geographic location of our hospitals. several actuarial methods are employed to utilize this data to produce estimates of ultimate losses and reserves for incurred but not reported claims, including: paid and incurred extrapolation methods utilizing paid and incurred loss development to estimate ultimate losses; frequency and severity methods utilizing paid and incurred claims development to estimate ultimate average frequency (number

of claims) and ultimate average severity (cost per claim); and bornhuetter-ferguson methods which add expected development to actual paid or incurred experience to estimate ultimate losses. these methods use our company-specific historical claims data and other information. company-specific claim reporting and payment data collected over an approximate 20-year period is used in our reserve estimation process. this company-specific data includes information regarding our business, including historical paid losses and loss adjustment expenses, historical and current case loss reserves, actual and projected hospital statistical data, professional liability retentions for each policy year, geographic information and other data.
reserves and provisions for professional liability risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates. the estimated reserve ranges, net of amounts receivable under reinsurance contracts, were $1.456 billion to $1.743 billion at december 31, 2017 and $1.358 billion to $1.625 billion at december 31, 2016. our estimated reserves for professional liability claims may change significantly if future claims differ from expected trends. we perform sensitivity analyses which model the volatility of key actuarial assumptions and monitor our reserves for adequacy relative to all our assumptions in the aggregate. based on our analysis, we believe the estimated professional liability reserve ranges represent the reasonably likely outcomes for ultimate losses. we consider the number and severity of claims to be the most significant assumptions in estimating reserves for professional liabilities. a 2.5% change in the expected frequency trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the reserve estimate by $30 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $29 million. a 2.5% change in the expected claim severity trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the reserve estimate by $106 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $98 million. we believe adequate reserves have been recorded for our professional liability claims; however, due to the complexity of the claims, the extended period of time to resolve the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes, our ultimate liability for professional liability claims could change by more than the estimated sensitivity amounts and could change materially from our current estimates.
the reserves for professional liability risks cover approximately 2,500 and 2,700 individual claims at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and estimates for unreported potential claims. the time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated. the average time period between the occurrence and final resolution for our professional liability claims is approximately four years, although the facts and circumstances of each individual claim can result in an occurrence-to-resolution timeframe that varies from this average. the estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year can vary significantly.
reserves for professional liability risks were $1.627 billion and $1.539 billion at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the current portion of these reserves, $429 million and $391 million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, is included in other accrued expenses. obligations covered by reinsurance and excess insurance contracts are included in the reserves for professional liability risks, as we remain liable to the extent reinsurers and excess insurance carriers do not meet their obligations. reserves for professional liability risks (net of $24 million and $45 million receivable under reinsurance and excess insurance contracts at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively) were $1.603 billion and $1.494 billion at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the estimated total net reserves for professional liability risks at december 31, 2017 and 2016 are comprised of $751 million and $830 million, respectively, of case reserves for known claims and $852 million and $664 million, respectively, of reserves for incurred but not reported claims.

income taxes we calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences that arise from the recognition of items in different periods for tax and accounting purposes. deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effects of amounts expensed in our income statement for which tax deductions will be claimed in future periods.
although we believe we have properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws, federal, state or foreign taxing authorities may challenge our tax positions upon audit. significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of uncertain tax positions. we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our income tax returns. during each reporting period, we assess the facts and circumstances related to uncertain tax positions. if the realization of unrecognized tax benefits is deemed probable based upon new facts and circumstances, the estimated liability and the provision for income taxes are reduced in the current period. final audit results may vary from our estimates.
results of operations revenue/volume trends our revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charge and negotiated payment rates for such services. gross charges typically do not reflect what our facilities are actually paid. our facilities have entered into agreements with third-party payers, including government programs and managed care health plans, under which the facilities are paid based upon the cost of providing services, predetermined rates per diagnosis, fixed per diem rates or discounts from gross charges. we do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who meet our guidelines to qualify for charity care; therefore, they are not reported in revenues. we provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for medicaid or charity care.

at december 31, 2017, we owned and operated 45 hospitals and 32 surgery centers in the state of florida. our florida facilities revenues totaled $10.168 billion, $9.522 billion and $9.059 billion for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. at december 31, 2017, we owned and operated 46 hospitals and 27 surgery centers in the state of texas. our texas facilities revenues totaled $10.634 billion, $9.898 billion and $9.517 billion for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. during 2017, 2016 and 2015, 56% of our admissions and 48%, 47% and 47%, respectively, of our revenues were generated by our florida and texas facilities. uninsured admissions in florida and texas represented 70%, 69% and 68% of our uninsured admissions during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
we receive a significant portion of our revenues from government health programs, principally medicare and medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. in december 2017, the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) announced that it will phase out federal matching funds for designated state health programs under waivers granted under section 1115 of the social security act due to concerns that the funds were not used as an integral part of medicaid demonstrations focused on delivery system reform or coverage reform.
texas currently operates its healthcare transformation and quality improvement program pursuant to a medicaid waiver (the texas waiver program). in december 2017, cms approved an extension of this waiver through september 30, 2022, but indicated that it will phase out some of the federal funding. as currently structured, the texas waiver program includes two primary components: an uncompensated care component and a delivery system reform incentive payment (dsrip) component. initiatives under the dsrip program are designed to provide incentive payments to hospitals and other providers for their investments in delivery system reforms that increase access to health care, improve the quality of care and enhance the health of patients and families they serve. cms will provide level dsrip funding for two years, decreased funding for the following two years, and no dsrip funding beginning october 1, 2021. in addition, the disbursement methodology for uncompensated care pool funding will be revised to align with federal policies. beginning october 1, 2019, texas will not receive any federal financial participation for uncompensated care pool payments until cms approves revised uncompensated care protocol policies for the state that will govern how hospitals uncompensated care entitlement is calculated and the size of the statewide uncompensated care pool. based on the waiver renewal terms, we expect the statewide uncompensated care pool size will ultimately be reduced, but

it is presently unclear whether our share of the pool and its corresponding uncompensated care payments will increase or decrease. we provide charity care services directly to patients in several communities in the state of texas, in affiliation with other hospitals. as a result of additional charitable care being provided directly to patients by private hospitals, public hospital districts or counties in texas have available funds that were previously devoted to indigent care. the public hospital districts or counties are under no contractual or legal obligation to provide such indigent care. the public hospital districts or counties have elected to transfer some portion of these available funds to the states medicaid program. such action is at the sole discretion of the public hospital districts or counties. it is anticipated that these contributions to the state will be matched with federal medicaid funds, as they have been for the past twelve years in texas. the state then may make supplemental payments to hospitals in the state for medicaid services rendered. hospitals receiving medicaid supplemental payments may include those that are providing additional indigent care services.
our texas medicaid revenues included $351 million ($108 million dsrip related and $243 million uncompensated care related), $370 million ($101 million dsrip related and $269 million uncompensated care related) and $347 million ($95 million dsrip related and $252 million uncompensated care related) during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of medicaid supplemental waiver payments. we cannot predict whether the texas medicaid waiver program will be further extended or revised beyond september 30, 2022.
in addition, we receive supplemental payments in several other states. we are aware these supplemental payment programs are currently being reviewed by certain state agencies and some states have made waiver requests to cms to replace their existing supplemental payment programs. it is possible these reviews and waiver requests will result in the restructuring of such supplemental payment programs and could result in the payment programs being reduced or eliminated. because deliberations about these programs are ongoing, we are unable to estimate the financial impact the program structure modifications, if any, may have on our results of operations.

our provision for income taxes for 2016 included tax benefits of $51 million primarily related to the resolution of federal income tax issues for our 2011 and 2012 tax years and $162 million related to excess tax benefits from employee equity award settlements. excluding the effect of these adjustments, the effective tax rate for 2016 would have been 37.3%.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests declined from $567 million for 2015 to $542 million for 2016. the decline in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests related primarily to joint ventures in our united kingdom market, a texas market and an oklahoma market.
liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements are paying our operating expenses, servicing our debt, capital expenditures on our existing properties, acquisitions of hospitals and other health care entities, repurchases of our common stock, distributions to stockholders and distributions to noncontrolling interests. our primary cash sources are cash flows from operating activities, issuances of debt and equity securities and dispositions of hospitals and other health care entities.
cash provided by operating activities totaled $5.426 billion in 2017 compared to $5.653 billion in 2016 and $4.734 billion in 2015. working capital totaled $3.819 billion at december 31, 2017 and $3.252 billion at december 31, 2016. the $227 million decline in cash provided by operating activities for 2017, compared to 2016, was primarily related to the $689 million decline in net income, offset by increases related to depreciation and amortization of $165 million and income taxes of $310 million. the $919 million increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily related to the $736 million increase in net income. cash payments for interest and income taxes declined $16 million for 2017 compared to 2016 and increased $85 million for 2016 compared to 2015.
cash used in investing activities was $4.279 billion, $3.240 billion and $2.583 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures were $3.015 billion in 2017, $2.760 billion in 2016 and $2.375 billion in 2015. we expended $1.212 billion, $576 million and $351 million for acquisitions of hospitals and health care entities during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. planned capital expenditures are expected to approximate $3.5 billion in 2018. at december 31, 2017, there were projects under construction which had an estimated additional cost to complete and equip over the next five years of approximately $3.1 billion. we expect to finance capital expenditures with internally generated and borrowed funds.
cash used in financing activities totaled $1.061 billion in 2017, $2.508 billion in 2016 and $1.976 billion in 2015. during 2017, we had a net increase of $1.509 billion in our indebtedness and used cash of $2.051 billion for repurchases of common stock. during 2016, we had a net increase of $815 million in our indebtedness and used cash of $2.751 billion for repurchases of common stock. during 2015, we had a net increase of $778 million in our indebtedness and used cash of $2.397 billion for repurchases of common stock. during 2017, 2016 and 2015, we made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $448 million, $434 million and $495 million, respectively. we paid debt issuance costs of $26 million, $40 million and $50 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we, or our affiliates, may in the future repurchase portions of our debt or equity securities, subject to certain limitations, from time to time in either the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable sec and other legal requirements. the timing, prices, and sizes of purchases depend upon prevailing trading prices, general economic and market conditions, and other factors, including applicable securities laws. at december 31, 2017, $1.802 billion of share repurchase authorization remained available under the $2 billion share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors during october 2017. funds for the

repurchase of debt or equity securities have, and are expected to, come primarily from cash generated from operations and borrowed funds. on january 30, 2018, our board of directors initiated and declared a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share on our common stock payable on march 30, 2018 to stockholders of record on march 1, 2018. the timing and amount of future cash dividends will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, share repurchases and investing in our existing markets, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of stockholders and are in compliance with all applicable laws and agreements of the company.
in addition to cash flows from operations, available sources of capital include amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities ($2.047 billion as of december 31, 2017 and $1.827 billion as of january 31, 2018) and anticipated access to public and private debt and equity markets.
investments of our insurance subsidiaries, to maintain statutory equity and pay claims, totaled $472 million and $385 million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the insurance subsidiary maintained net reserves for professional liability risks of $194 million and $215 million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence; however, this coverage is subject to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention. net reserves for the self-insured professional liability risks retained were $1.409 billion and $1.279 billion at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. claims payments, net of reinsurance recoveries, during the next 12 months are expected to approximate $424 million. we estimate that approximately $378 million of the expected net claim payments during the next 12 months will relate to claims subject to the self-insured retention.
financing activities we are a highly leveraged company with significant debt service requirements. our debt totaled $33.058 billion and $31.376 billion at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. our interest expense was $1.690 billion for 2017 and $1.707 billion for 2016.
during march 2016, we issued $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.250% senior secured notes due 2026. we used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and to retire a portion of one of our senior secured term loans. we also entered into a joinder agreement to retire the remaining portion of this senior secured term loan using proceeds from a new $1.500 billion senior secured term loan facility maturing in march 2023.
during august 2016, we issued $1.200 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.500% senior secured notes due 2027. we used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and to retire a portion of one of our senior secured term loans. we also entered into a joinder agreement to retire the remaining portion of this senior secured term loan using proceeds from a new $1.200 billion senior secured term loan facility maturing in february 2024. the pretax loss on retirement of debt was $4 million.
during june 2017, we issued $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.500% senior secured notes due 2047. we used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding the purchase of certain hospital acquisitions, and the redemption, during july 2017, of all $500 million aggregate principal amount of our existing 8.000% senior notes maturing in october 2018. the pretax loss on retirement of debt was $39 million.

during june 2017, we amended our senior secured revolving credit facilities by (i) increasing the commitments under the senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility to $3.750 billion, (ii) extending the maturity date of the revolving credit commitments to june 28, 2022, (iii) amending the incremental facility provisions to permit the incurrence of additional incremental credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion and (iv) providing that the commitment fee for unutilized commitments under the senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility shall be 0.250% per annum.
management believes that cash flows from operations, amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities and our anticipated access to public and private debt markets will be sufficient to meet expected liquidity needs during the next twelve months.

(a)                we have not included obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits of $439 million at december 31, 2017, as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing or amounts of cash payments, if any, at this time.

(b)   estimates of interest payments assume that interest rates and borrowing spreads at december 31, 2017, remain constant during the period presented.

(c)                              the estimation of the timing of payments for professional liability claims beyond a year can vary significantly. the time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated.

(d)                   amounts relate to future operating lease obligations, purchase obligations and other obligations and are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. amounts also include physician commitments that are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet.

(e)                amounts relate primarily to instances in which we have agreed to indemnify various commercial insurers and lenders who have provided surety bonds and letters of credit to cover utility and construction deposits and medicaid provider bonds.

(f)                                                                     in consideration for physicians relocating to the communities in which our hospitals are located and agreeing to engage in private practice for the benefit of the respective communities, we make advances to physicians, normally over a period of one year, to assist in establishing the physicians practices. the actual amount of these commitments to be advanced often depends upon the financial results of the physicians private practice during the recruitment agreement payment period. the physician commitments reflected were based on our maximum exposure on effective agreements at december 31, 2017.

market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. the investments in our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries were $472 million at december 31, 2017. these investments are carried at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. at december 31, 2017, we had a net unrealized gain of $10 million on the insurance subsidiaries investment securities.
we are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. investments in debt and equity securities of our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. should the 100% owned insurance subsidiaries require significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a normal market environment. we may be required to recognize other-than-temporary impairments on our investment securities in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue-specific factors.
we are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, and we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. our interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. the notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities. our credit risk related to these agreements is considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions. the interest payments under these agreements are settled on a net basis. these derivatives have been recognized in the financial statements at their respective fair values. changes in the fair value of these derivatives, which are designated as cash flow hedges, are included in other comprehensive income.
with respect to our interest-bearing liabilities, approximately $5.072 billion of long-term debt at december 31, 2017 was subject to variable rates of interest, while the remaining balance in long-term debt of $27.986 billion at december 31, 2017 was subject to fixed rates of interest. both the general level of interest rates and, for the senior secured credit facilities, our leverage affect our variable interest rates. our variable debt is comprised primarily of amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities. borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (2) the prime rate of bank of america or (b) a libor rate for the currency of such borrowing for the relevant interest period. the applicable margin for borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities may fluctuate according to a leverage ratio. the average effective interest rate for our long-term debt declined from 5.5% for 2016 to 5.3% for 2017.
the estimated fair value of our total long-term debt was $34.689 billion at december 31, 2017. the estimates of fair value are based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues of long-term debt with the same maturities. based on a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates, the potential annualized reduction to future pretax earnings would be approximately $51 million. to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates, we generally target a majority of our debt portfolio to be maintained at fixed rates.
we are exposed to currency translation risk related to our foreign operations. we currently do not consider the market risk related to foreign currency translation to be material to our consolidated financial statements or our liquidity.

financial instruments derivative financial instruments are employed to manage risks, including interest rate exposures, and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. we recognize derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements, in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized periodically either in earnings or in stockholders equity, as a component of other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income, and subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the impact of the hedged items when they occur.
the net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps is recognized as interest expense. gains and losses resulting from the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are deferred and amortized as adjustments to expense over the remaining period of the debt originally covered by the terminated swap.
effects of inflation and changing prices various federal, state and local laws have been enacted that, in certain cases, limit our ability to increase prices. revenues for general, acute care hospital services rendered to medicare patients are established under the federal governments prospective payment system. total fee-for-service medicare revenues were 21.7%, 21.4% and 21.8% of our revenues for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
management believes hospital industry operating margins have been, and may continue to be, under significant pressure because of changes in payer and service mix and growth in operating expenses in excess of the increase in prospective payments under the medicare program. in addition, as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures, our ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to non-medicare patients is limited.
tax examinations during 2016, the irs completed its examination, resolving all outstanding federal income tax issues for our 2011 and 2012 tax years. we are subject to examination by the irs for tax years 2014 and later as well as by state and foreign taxing authorities.
management believes hca healthcare, inc., its predecessors and affiliates properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with the irs, state and foreign taxing authorities and final resolution of any disputes will not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. however, if payments due upon final resolution of any issues exceed our recorded estimates, such resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.

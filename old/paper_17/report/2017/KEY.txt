item 1a.  risk factors as a financial services organization, we are subject to a number of risks inherent in our transactions and present in the business decisions we make. described below are the primary risks and uncertainties that if realized could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, and our access to liquidity. the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face.
our erm program incorporates risk management throughout our organization to identify, understand, and manage the risks presented by our business activities. our erm program identifies key's major risk categories as: credit risk, compliance risk, operational risk, liquidity risk, market risk, reputation risk, strategic risk, and model risk. these risk factors, and other risks we may face, are discussed in more detail in other sections of this report.
i.  credit risk we have concentrated credit exposure in commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, and commercial leases.
as of december 31, 2017, approximately 73% of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, including commercial mortgage and construction loans, and commercial leases. these types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans, and have a different risk profile. the deterioration of a larger loan or a group of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans, which could result in net loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses, and an increase in loan charge-offs.
should the fundamentals of the commercial real estate market deteriorate, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
the strong recovery in commercial real estate over the past several years, in particular the multifamily property sector, has contributed to a surge in investment and development activity. as a result, property values are elevated and oversupply is a concern in certain markets. substantial deterioration in property market fundamentals could have an impact on our portfolio, with a large portion of our clients active in real estate and specifically multifamily real estate. a correction in the real estate markets could impact the ability of borrowers to make debt service payments on loans. a portion of our commercial real estate loans are construction loans. typically these properties are not fully leased at loan origination; the borrower may require additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide cash flow to support debt service payments. if property market fundamentals deteriorate sharply, the execution of new leases could slow, compromising the borrower's ability to cover the debt service payments.
we are subject to the risk of defaults by our loan counterparties and clients.
many of our routine transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of counterparties and clients, including financial statements, credit reports and other information. we may also rely on representations of those counterparties, clients, or other third parties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. the inaccuracy of that information or those representations affects our ability to accurately evaluate the default risk of a counterparty or client. given the dodd-frank legislative mandate to centrally clear eligible derivative contracts, we rely on central clearing counterparties to remain open and operationally viable at all times. the possibility of a large member failure or a cybersecurity breach could result in a disruption in this market.
20
various factors may cause our allowance for loan and lease losses to increase.
we maintain an alll (a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense) that represents our estimate of losses based on our evaluation of risks within our existing portfolio of loans. the level of the allowance reflects our ongoing evaluation of industry concentrations; specific credit risks; loan and lease loss experience; current loan portfolio quality; present economic, political and regulatory conditions; and incurred losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. the determination of the appropriate level of the alll inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and current trends, all of which may undergo material changes. changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, the softening of certain economic indicators that we are more susceptible to, such as unemployment and real estate values, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may indicate the need for an increase in the alll. bank regulatory agencies periodically review our alll and, based on judgments that can differ somewhat from those of our own management, may necessitate an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs. in addition, if charge-offs outpace the estimate in our current methodology used to establish our alll (i.e., if the loan and lease allowance is inadequate), we will need additional loan and lease loss provisions to increase the alll, which would decrease our net income and capital.
declining asset prices could adversely affect us.
during the great recession, the volatility and disruption that the capital and credit markets experienced reached extreme levels. this severe market disruption led to the failure of several substantial financial institutions, which caused the credit markets to constrain and also caused a widespread liquidation of assets. these asset sales, along with asset sales by other leveraged investors, including some hedge funds, rapidly drove down prices and valuations across a wide variety of traded asset classes. asset price deterioration has a negative effect on the valuation of certain of the asset categories represented on our balance sheet, and reduces our ability to sell assets at prices we deem acceptable. although the recovery has been in place for some time, a new recession would likely reverse recent positive trends in asset prices.
ii.  compliance risk we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision.
as a financial services institution, we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision, which previously increased in recent years due to the implementation of the dodd-frank act and other financial reform initiatives. banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors' funds, the dif, consumers, taxpayers, and the banking system as a whole, not our debtholders or shareholders. these regulations increase our costs and affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, ability to repurchase our common shares, and growth, among other things.
keybank has faced scrutiny from our bank supervisors in the examination process and aggressive enforcement of regulations at the federal and state levels, particularly due to keybank's and keycorp's status as covered institutions under the dodd-frank act's heightened prudential standards and regulations, including its provisions designed to protect consumers from financial abuse. although many parts of the dodd-frank act are now in effect, other parts continue to be implemented, as well as other significant regulations which have been enacted with upcoming effective dates. as a result, some uncertainty remains as to the aggregate impact upon key of the dodd-frank act and other significant regulations.
changes to existing statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or their interpretation or implementation could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. these changes may subject us to additional costs and increase our litigation risk should we fail to appropriately comply. such changes may also limit the types of financial services and products we may offer, affect the investments we make, and change the manner in which we operate.
additionally, federal banking law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking regulators. this enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and affiliated parties. these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations, for practices determined to be unsafe or unsound, or for practices or acts that are determined to be unfair, deceptive, or abusive.
21
for more information, see "supervision and regulation" in item 1 of this report.
changes in accounting policies, standards, and interpretations could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations.
the fasb periodically changes the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of key's financial statements. additionally, those bodies that establish and/or interpret the financial accounting and reporting standards (such as the fasb, sec, and banking regulators) may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how key records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. in some cases, key could be required to retroactively apply a new or revised standard, resulting in changes to previously reported financial results.
iii.  operational risk we are subject to a variety of operational risks.
in addition to the other risks discussed in this section, we are subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error, inadequate or failed internal processes, internal controls, systems, and external events. operational risk includes the risk of fraud by employees, clerical and record-keeping errors, nonperformance by vendors, threats to cybersecurity, and computer/telecommunications malfunctions. operational risk also encompasses compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of our noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. we are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business, such as certain loan processing functions. for example, breakdowns or failures of our vendors' systems or employees could be a source of operational risk to us. resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation, inability to secure insurance, litigation, regulatory intervention or sanctions or foregone business opportunities.
our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.
we rely heavily on communications, information systems (both internal and provided by third parties) and the internet to conduct our business. our business is dependent on our ability to process and monitor large numbers of daily transactions in compliance with legal, regulatory, and internal standards and specifications. in addition, a significant portion of our operations relies heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of personal and confidential information, such as the personal information of our customers and clients. these risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase mobile payments and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications.
in the event of a failure, interruption, or breach of our information systems, we may be unable to avoid impact to our customers. such a failure, interruption, or breach could result in legal liability, remediation costs, regulatory action, or reputational harm. other u.s. financial service institutions and companies have reported breaches, some severe, in the security of their websites or other systems and several financial institutions, including key, experienced significant distributed denial-of-service attacks, some of which involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems. other potential attacks have attempted to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, hold for ransom, or alter or destroy data, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, phishing, cyberattacks, and other means. to date, none of these efforts has had a material adverse effect on our business or operations. such security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including persons who are involved with organized crime or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients. our security systems may not be able to protect our information systems from similar attacks due to the rapid evolution and creation of sophisticated cyberattacks. we are also subject to the risk that our employees may intercept and transmit unauthorized confidential or proprietary information. an interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential, or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability, remediation costs, regulatory action, and reputational harm.
22
we rely on third parties to perform significant operational services for us.
third parties perform significant operational services on our behalf. these third parties are subject to similar risks as key relating to cybersecurity, breakdowns or failures of their own systems or employees. one or more of these third parties may experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and, if any such event does occur, it may not be adequately addressed, either operationally or financially, by such third party. certain of these third parties may have limited indemnification obligations or may not have the financial capacity to satisfy their indemnification obligations. financial or operational difficulties of a third party could also impair our operations if those difficulties interfere with such third party's ability to serve us. additionally, some of our outsourcing arrangements are located overseas and, therefore, are subject to risks unique to the regions in which they operate. if a critical third party is unable to meet our needs in a timely manner or if the services or products provided by such third party are terminated or otherwise delayed and if we are not able to develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and cost-effectively, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. additionally, regulatory guidance adopted by federal banking regulators related to how banks select, engage and manage their third parties affects the circumstances and conditions under which we work with third parties and the cost of managing such relationships.
we are subject to claims and litigation, which could result in significant financial liability and/or reputational risk.
from time to time, customers, vendors, or other parties may make claims and take legal action against us. we maintain reserves for certain claims when deemed appropriate based upon our assessment that a loss is probable, estimable, and consistent with applicable accounting guidance. at any given time we have a variety of legal actions asserted against us in various stages of litigation. resolution of a legal action can often take years. whether any particular claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor, they may result in significant financial liability and adversely affect how the market perceives us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services.
we are also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations, and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our business, including, among other things, accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other relief. the number and risk of these investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many firms in the financial services industry due to legal changes to the consumer protection laws provided for by the dodd-frank act and the creation of the cfpb.
there have also been a number of highly publicized legal claims against financial institutions involving fraud or misconduct by employees, and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur. it is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases.
our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, and our methods of reducing risk exposure may not be effective.
we regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. we also maintain an erm program designed to identify, measure, monitor, report, and analyze our risks. any system of controls and any system to reduce risk exposure, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. additionally, instruments, systems, and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of market compliance, credit, liquidity, operational, and business risks and enterprise-wide risk could be less effective than anticipated. as a result, we may not be able to effectively mitigate our risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk.
climate change, severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, and other external events could significantly impact our business.
natural disasters, including severe weather events of increasing strength and frequency due to climate change, acts of war or terrorism, and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business or upon third parties who perform operational services for us or our customers. such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of
23
collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in lost revenue, or cause us to incur additional expenses.
iv.  liquidity risk capital and liquidity requirements imposed by the dodd-frank act require banks and bhcs to maintain more and higher quality capital and more and higher quality liquid assets than has historically been the case.
evolving capital standards resulting from the dodd-frank act and the regulatory capital rules adopted by our regulators have had and will continue to have a significant impact on banks and bhcs, including key. for a detailed explanation of the capital and liquidity rules that became effective for us on a phased-in basis on january 1, 2015, see the section titled "regulatory capital requirements" under the heading "supervision and regulation" in item 1 of this report.
the federal reserve's capital standards require key to maintain more and higher quality capital and could limit our business activities (including lending) and our ability to expand organically or through acquisitions. they could also result in our taking steps to increase our capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders.
in addition, the new liquidity standards required us to increase our holdings of higher-quality liquid assets, may require us to change our future mix of investment alternatives, and may impact future business relationships with certain customers. additionally, support of liquidity standards may be satisfied through the use of term wholesale borrowings, which tend to have a higher cost than that of traditional core deposits.
further, the federal reserve requires bhcs to obtain approval before making a "capital distribution," such as paying or increasing dividends, implementing common stock repurchase programs, or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. the federal reserve has detailed the processes that bhcs should maintain to ensure they hold adequate capital under severely adverse conditions and have ready access to funding before engaging in any capital activities. these rules could limit key's ability to make distributions, including paying out dividends or buying back shares. for more information, see the section titled "regulatory capital requirements" under the heading "supervision and regulation" in item 1 of this report.
federal agencies may take actions that disrupt the stability of the u.s. financial system.
since 2008, the federal government has taken unprecedented steps to provide stability to and confidence in the financial markets. for example, the federal reserve maintains a variety of stimulus policy measures designed to maintain a low interest rate environment. in light of recent moderate improvements in the u.s. economy, federal agencies may no longer support such initiatives. the discontinuation of such initiatives may have unanticipated or unintended impacts, perhaps severe, on the financial markets. these effects could include higher debt yields, a flatter or steeper slope to the yield curve, or unanticipated changes to quality spread premiums that may not follow historical relationships or patterns as the federal reserve gradually reverses quantitative easing and reduces the size of its balance sheet. in addition, new initiatives or legislation may not be implemented, or, if implemented, may not be adequate to counter any negative effects of discontinuing programs or, in the event of an economic downturn, to support and stabilize the economy.
we rely on dividends by our subsidiaries for most of our funds.
we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries. with the exception of cash that we may raise from debt and equity issuances, we receive substantially all of our funding from dividends by our subsidiaries. dividends by our subsidiaries are the principal source of funds for the dividends we pay on our common and preferred stock and interest and principal payments on our debt. federal banking law and regulations limit the amount of dividends that keybank (keycorp's largest subsidiary) can pay. for further information on the regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by keybank, see "supervision and regulation" in item 1 of this report.
in the event keybank is unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to service debt, pay obligations, or pay dividends on our common or preferred stock. such a situation could result in key losing access to alternative wholesale funding sources. in addition, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors.
24
we are subject to liquidity risk, which could negatively affect our funding levels.
market conditions or other events could negatively affect our access to or the cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, or fund asset growth and new business initiatives at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences.
although we maintain a liquid asset portfolio and have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet commitments under various economic conditions (including a reduced level of wholesale funding sources), a substantial, unexpected, or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on us. if the cost effectiveness or the availability of supply in these credit markets is reduced for a prolonged period of time, our funding needs may require us to access funding and manage liquidity by other means. these alternatives may include generating client deposits, securitizing or selling loans, extending the maturity of wholesale borrowings, borrowing under certain secured borrowing arrangements, using relationships developed with a variety of fixed income investors, and further managing loan growth and investment opportunities. these alternative means of funding may result in an increase to the overall cost of funds and may not be available under stressed conditions, which would cause us to liquidate a portion of our liquid asset portfolio to meet any funding needs.
our credit ratings affect our liquidity position.
the rating agencies regularly evaluate the securities issued by keycorp and keybank, and their ratings of our long-term debt and other securities are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength, ability to generate earnings, and other factors. some of these factors are not entirely within our control, such as conditions affecting the financial services industry and the economy and changes in rating methodologies. changes in any of these factors could impact our ability to maintain our current credit ratings. a rating downgrade of the securities of keycorp or keybank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us, reducing our ability to generate income.
v.  market risk a reversal of the u.s. economic recovery and a return to volatile or recessionary conditions in the u.s. or abroad could negatively affect our business or our access to capital markets.
a worsening of economic and market conditions, downside shocks, or a return to recessionary economic conditions could result in adverse effects on key and others in the financial services industry. the prolonged low-interest rate environment, despite a generally improving economy, has presented a challenge for the industry, including key, and affects business and financial performance.
in particular, we could face some of the following risks, and other unforeseeable risks, in connection with a downturn in the economic and market environment or in the face of downside shocks or a recession, whether in the united states or internationally:
•   a loss of confidence in the financial services industry and the debt and equity markets by investors, placing pressure on the price of key's common shares or decreasing the credit or liquidity available to key;
•   a decrease in consumer and business confidence levels generally, decreasing credit usage and investment or increasing delinquencies and defaults;
•   a decrease in household or corporate incomes, reducing demand for key's products and services;
•   a decrease in the value of collateral securing loans to key's borrowers or a decrease in the quality of key's loan portfolio, increasing loan charge-offs and reducing key's net income;
•   a decrease in our ability to liquidate positions at acceptable market prices;
•   the extended continuation of the current low-interest rate environment, continuing or increasing downward pressure to our net interest income;
•   an increase in competition or consolidation in the financial services industry;
•   increased concern over and scrutiny of the capital and liquidity levels of financial institutions generally, and those of our transaction counterparties specifically;
•   a decrease in confidence in the creditworthiness of the united states or other governments whose securities we hold; and
•   an increase in limitations on or the regulation of financial services companies like key.
25
we are subject to interest rate risk, which could adversely affect net interest income.
our earnings are largely dependent upon our net interest income. net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets, consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products, and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular, the federal reserve. changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rate controls being applied by the federal reserve, could influence the amount of interest we receive on loans and securities, the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities. as the federal reserve continues to raise interest rates and begins to reverse quantitative easing, the behavior of national money market rate indices, the correlation of consumer deposit rates to financial market interest rates, and the setting of libor rates may not follow historical relationships, which could influence net interest income and net interest margin.
moreover, if the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we receive on loans and other investments, net interest income, and therefore our earnings, would be adversely affected. conversely, earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings.
our profitability depends upon economic conditions in the geographic regions where we have significant operations and on certain market segments in which we conduct significant business.
we have concentrations of loans and other business activities in geographic regions where our bank branches are located - washington; oregon/alaska; rocky mountains; indiana/northwest ohio/michigan; central/southwest ohio; east ohio/western pennsylvania; atlantic; western new york; eastern new york; and new england - and additional exposure to geographic regions outside of our branch footprint. the moderate u.s. economic recovery in the various regions where we operate has been uneven, and continued improvement in the overall u.s. economy may not result in similar improvement, or any improvement at all, in the economy of any particular geographic region. adverse conditions in a geographic region such as inflation, unemployment, recession, natural disasters, or other factors beyond our control could impact the ability of borrowers in these regions to repay their loans, decrease the value of collateral securing loans made in these regions, or affect the ability of our customers in these regions to continue conducting business with us.
additionally, a significant portion of our business activities are concentrated within the real estate and healthcare market segments. the profitability of some of these market segments depends upon the health of the overall economy, seasonality, the impact of regulation, and other factors that are beyond our control and may be beyond the control of our customers in these market segments.
an economic downturn in one or more geographic regions where we conduct our business, or any significant or prolonged impact on the profitability of one or more of the market segments with which we conduct significant business activity, could adversely affect the demand for our products and services, the ability of our customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans, and the stability of our deposit funding sources.
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.
our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties in the financial services industries, and we routinely execute transactions with such counterparties, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. defaults by one or more financial services institutions have led to, and may cause, market-wide liquidity problems and losses. many of our transactions with other financial institutions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client. in addition, our credit risk may be affected when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivatives exposure due us.
26
tax reform is anticipated to have an impact on our tax liabilities, the tax liabilities of our clients, and how we do business.
on december 22, 2017, the tcj act was signed into law. this comprehensive tax legislation provides for significant changes to the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, that impact corporate taxation requirements, such as the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018. the tcj act retains the low-income housing and research and development credits and repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax. other relevant corporate changes include earlier recognition of certain revenue; accelerating expensing of investments in tangible property, including leasing assets; and limiting several deductions such as fdic premiums, certain executive compensation, and meals and entertainment expense.
key is currently assessing the overall impact of the tcj act on the future expected federal income tax obligations of both key and our clients. we expect that key's future federal income tax liabilities will overall benefit from the provisions in the tcj act. however, we also expect that certain aspects of our business may change over time; both as to the investments we may make as a result of tax reform and in response to how the provisions in the tcj act may affect our customers and influence how we offer and deliver our products and services in the future.
refer to note 14, income taxes, for information on the impact of the tcj act to our 2017 financial results.
vi.  reputation risk damage to our reputation could significantly harm our businesses.
our ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors, and highly-skilled management and employees is affected by our reputation. public perception of the financial services industry has declined as a result of the great recession. we face increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the financial crisis and economic downturn. significant harm to our reputation can also arise from other sources, including employee misconduct, actual or perceived unethical behavior, litigation or regulatory outcomes, failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality, compliance failures, disclosure of confidential information, significant or numerous failures, interruptions or breaches of our information systems, failure to meet external commitments and goals, and the activities of our clients, customers and counterparties, including vendors. actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry may have a significant adverse effect on our reputation. we could also suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest. management of potential conflicts of interests is complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among our clients. the actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us, which could adversely affect our businesses.
vii.  strategic risk we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategic initiatives.
our ability to compete depends on a number of factors, including among others our ability to develop and successfully execute our strategic plans and initiatives. our strategic priorities include growing profitably and maintaining financial strength; effectively managing risk and reward; engaging a high-performing, talented, and diverse workforce; embracing the changes required by our clients and the marketplace; and acquiring and expanding targeted client relationships. our inability to execute on or achieve the anticipated outcomes of our strategic priorities may affect how the market perceives us and could impede our growth and profitability.
27
we operate in a highly competitive industry.
we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of competitors, some of which are larger and may have more financial resources than us. our competitors primarily include national and super-regional banks as well as smaller community banks within the various geographic regions in which we operate. we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage banking companies, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, investment management firms, investment banking firms, broker-dealers and other local, regional, national, and global financial services firms. in addition, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. we expect the competitive landscape of the financial services industry to become even more intense as a result of legislative, regulatory, structural, and technological changes.
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including: our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and initiatives; our ability to develop, maintain, and build long-term customer relationships based on quality service and competitive prices; our ability to develop competitive products and technologies demanded by our customers, while maintaining our high ethical standards and keeping our assets safe and sound; our ability to attract, retain, and develop a highly competent employee workforce; and industry and general economic trends. increased competition in the financial services industry, or our failure to perform in any of these areas, could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability.
maintaining or increasing our market share depends upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences, while maintaining competitive prices.
the continuous, widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet services and mobile devices (including smartphones and tablets), requires us to evaluate our product and service offerings to ensure they remain competitive. our success depends, in part, on our ability to adapt our products and services, as well as our distribution of them, to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences. new technologies have altered consumer behavior by allowing consumers to complete transactions such as paying bills or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. new products allow consumers to maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits. the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as "disintermediation," could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and related income generated from those deposits.
the increasing pressure from our competitors, both bank and nonbank, to keep pace and adopt new technologies and products and services requires us to incur substantial expense. we may be unsuccessful in developing or introducing new products and services, modifying our existing products and services, adapting to changing consumer preferences and spending and saving habits, achieving market acceptance or regulatory approval, sufficiently developing or maintaining a loyal customer base, or offering products and services at prices lower than the prices offered by our competitors. these risks may affect our ability to achieve growth in our market share and could reduce both our revenue streams from certain products and services and our revenues from our net interest income.
we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.
our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, retain, motivate, and develop key people. competition for the best people in most of our business activities is ongoing and can be intense, and we may not be able to retain or hire the people we want or need to serve our customers. to attract and retain qualified employees, we must compensate these employees at market levels. typically, those levels have caused employee compensation to be our greatest expense.
various restrictions on compensation of certain executive officers were imposed under the dodd-frank act and other legislation and regulations. in addition, our incentive compensation structure is subject to review by our regulators, who may identify deficiencies in the structure of or issue additional guidance on our compensation practices, causing us to make changes that may affect our ability to offer competitive compensation to these individuals or that place us at a disadvantage to non-financial service competitors. our ability to attract and retain talented employees may be affected by these developments, or any new executive compensation limits and regulations.
28
acquisitions or strategic partnerships may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value.
acquiring other banks, bank branches, or other businesses involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions or partnerships, including exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired company; diversion of our management's time and attention; significant integration risk with respect to employees, accounting systems, and technology platforms; increased regulatory scrutiny; and, the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired company. we regularly evaluate merger and acquisition and strategic partnership opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions. as a result, mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur at any time. acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values. therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction.
we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger with first niagara.
keycorp consummated its merger with first niagara on august 1, 2016. the success of the merger, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend on, among other things, our ability to combine the businesses of keycorp and first niagara in a manner that permits growth opportunities, including, among other things, enhanced revenues and revenue synergies, an expanded market reach and operating efficiencies, and that does not materially disrupt the existing customer relationships of keycorp or first niagara nor result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers. if we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy and could have an adverse effect on the surviving corporation's business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. in addition, it is possible that the integration process could result in the disruption of our ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger.
viii.  model risk we rely on quantitative models to manage certain accounting, risk management, and capital planning functions.
we use quantitative models to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions, including estimating incurred loan losses, measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable, estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, managing risk, and for capital planning purposes (including during the ccar capital planning process). our modeling methodologies rely on many assumptions, historical analyses and correlations. these assumptions may be incorrect, particularly in times of market distress, and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant. additionally, as businesses and markets evolve, our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution. even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate, our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code, bad data, misuse of data, or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model's design.
as a result, our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face, may suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not, or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate. if our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis, we may not make appropriate risk management, capital planning, or other business or financial decisions. furthermore, strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable, and as a result, we may realize losses or other lapses.
banking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses. the failure or inadequacy of a model may result in increased regulatory scrutiny on us or may result in an enforcement action or proceeding against us by one of our regulators.

introduction this section reviews the financial condition and results of operations of keycorp and its subsidiaries for each of the past three years. some tables include additional periods to comply with disclosure requirements or to illustrate trends in greater depth. when you read this discussion, you should also refer to the consolidated financial statements and related notes in this report. the page locations of specific sections that we refer to are presented in the table of contents.
terminology throughout this discussion, references to "key," "we," "our," "us," and similar terms refer to the consolidated entity consisting of keycorp and its subsidiaries. "keycorp" refers solely to the parent holding company, and "keybank" refers solely to keycorp's subsidiary bank, keybank national association. keybank (consolidated) refers to the consolidated entity consisting of keybank and its subsidiaries.
we want to explain some industry-specific terms at the outset so you can better understand the discussion that follows.
•   we use the phrase continuing operations in this document to mean all of our businesses other than the education lending business, victory, and austin. the education lending business and austin have been accounted for as discontinued operations since 2009. victory was classified as a discontinued operation in our first quarter 2013 financial reporting as a result of the sale of this business as announced on february 21, 2013, and closed on july 31, 2013.
•   our exit loan portfolios are separate from our discontinued operations. these portfolios, which are in a run-off mode, stem from product lines we decided to cease because they no longer fit with our corporate strategy. these exit loan portfolios are included in other segments.
•   we engage in capital markets activities primarily through business conducted by our key corporate bank segment. these activities encompass a variety of products and services. among other things, we trade securities as a dealer, enter into derivative contracts (both to accommodate clients' financing needs and to mitigate certain risks), and conduct transactions in foreign currencies (both to accommodate clients' needs and to benefit from fluctuations in exchange rates).
•   for regulatory purposes, capital is divided into two classes. federal regulations currently prescribe that at least one-half of a bank or bhc's total risk-based capital must qualify as tier 1 capital. both total and tier 1 capital serve as bases for several measures of capital adequacy, which is an important indicator of financial stability and condition. as described under the heading "regulatory capital requirements - capital planning and stress testing" in the section entitled "supervision and regulation" in item 1 of this report, the regulators are required to conduct a supervisory capital assessment of all bhcs with assets of at least $50 billion, including keycorp. as part of this capital adequacy review, banking regulators evaluated a component of tier 1 capital, known as common equity tier 1, under the regulatory capital rules. the "capital" section of this report under the heading "capital adequacy" in the md&amp;a provides more information on total capital, tier 1 capital, and the regulatory capital rules, including common equity tier 1, and describes how the these measures are calculated.

(b)   assumes conversion of common share options and other stock awards and/or convertible preferred stock, as applicable.
(c)   see figure 2 entitled "gaap to non-gaap reconciliations," which presents the computations of certain financial measures related to "tangible common equity" and "cash efficiency." the table reconciles the gaap performance measures to the corresponding non-gaap measures, which provides a basis for period-to-period comparisons.
(d)   represents period-end consolidated total loans and loans held for sale (excluding education loans in securitizations trusts for periods prior to 2014) divided by period-end consolidated total deposits (excluding deposits in foreign office).

figure 2 presents certain non-gaap financial measures related to "tangible common equity," "return on tangible common equity," "cash efficiency ratio," "pre-provision net revenue," certain financial measures excluding notable items, and "common equity tier 1 under the regulatory capital rules"
notable items include certain revenue or expense items that may occur in a reporting period which management does not consider indicative of ongoing financial performance. management believes it is useful to consider certain financial metrics with and without merger-related charges and/or other notable items, including the impact of tax reform and related actions, in order to enable a better understanding of our results, increase comparability of period-to-period results, and to evaluate and forecast those results.
as disclosed in note 2 ("business combination") and note 15 ("acquisitions, divestiture, and discontinued operations"), we completed the purchase of first niagara on august 1, 2016. the definitive agreement and plan of merger to acquire first niagara was originally announced on october 30, 2015. as a result of this transaction, we have recognized merger-related charges which are included in the total for "notable items." figure 2 shows the computation of "return on average tangible common equity excluding notable items," "pre-provision net revenue excluding notable items," "cash efficiency ratio excluding notable items," and "return on average assets from continuing operations excluding notable items."
the tangible common equity ratio and the return on tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some investors, and management believes that these ratios may assist investors in analyzing key's capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity, we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases. figure 2 reconciles the gaap performance measures to the corresponding non-gaap measures.
figure 2 also shows the computation for and reconciliation of pre-provision net revenue, which is not formally defined by gaap. we believe that eliminating the effects of the provision for credit losses makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis.
the cash efficiency ratio is a ratio of two non-gaap performance measures. accordingly, there is no directly comparable gaap performance measure. the cash efficiency ratio excludes the impact of our intangible asset amortization from the calculation. we also disclose the cash efficiency ratio excluding notable items. we believe these ratios provide greater consistency and comparability between our results and those of our peer banks.
additionally, these ratios are used by analysts and investors as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis.
non-gaap financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. although these non-gaap financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, nor as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap.

as we have now reached our existing long-term goals in 2017, beginning in 2018, we have revised our long-term financial targets as follows:
•   generate positive operating leverage and a cash efficiency ratio in the range of 54% to 56%;
•   maintain a moderate risk profile by targeting a net loan charge-offs to average loans ratio in the range of .40% to .60%; and
•   a return on tangible common equity ratio in the range of 15% to 18%.
corporate strategy we remain committed to enhancing long-term shareholder value by continuing to execute our relationship-oriented business model, growing our franchise, and being disciplined in our capital management. our strategic focus is to deliver ease, value, and expertise to help our clients make better financial decisions and build enduring relationships. we intend to pursue this strategy by growing profitably; acquiring and expanding targeted client relationships; effectively managing risk and rewards; maintaining financial strength; and engaging, retaining, and inspiring our diverse and high-performing workforce. these strategic priorities for enhancing long-term shareholder value are described in more detail below.
•   grow profitably - we will continue to focus on generating positive operating leverage by growing revenue and creating a more efficient operating environment. we expect our relationship business model to keep
38
generating organic growth as it helps us expand engagement with existing clients and attract new customers. we will leverage our continuous improvement culture to maintain an efficient cost structure that is aligned, sustainable, and consistent with the current operating environment and that supports our relationship business model.
•   acquire and expand targeted client relationships - we seek to be client-centric in our actions and have taken purposeful steps to enhance our ability to acquire and expand targeted relationships. for example, in commercial banking, our ability to deliver a broad product set and industry expertise allows us to match client needs and market conditions to deliver attractive solutions to clients.
•   effectively manage risk and rewards - our risk management activities are focused on ensuring we properly identify, measure, and manage risks across the entire company to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability.
•   maintain financial strength - with the foundation of a strong balance sheet, we will remain focused on sustaining strong reserves, liquidity and capital. we will work closely with our board and regulators to manage capital to support our clients' needs and drive long-term shareholder value. our capital remains a competitive advantage for us.
•   engage a high-performing, talented, and diverse workforce - every day our employees provide our clients with great ideas, extraordinary service, and smart solutions. we will continue to engage our high-performing, talented, and diverse workforce to create an environment where they can make a difference, own their careers, be respected, and feel a sense of pride.
strategic developments we took the following actions during 2017 to support our corporate strategy:
•   we continued to generate positive operating leverage versus the prior year. our cash efficiency ratio, excluding notable items, was 60.2% for 2017, an improvement of 410 basis points compared to the prior year. we generated revenue synergies from our recent acquisitions, which we expect will continue to provide significant upside over the next several years. revenue for 2017 grew 25.4% from 2016, driven by an increase in net interest income reflecting the full year benefit from the first niagara acquisition in addition to higher interest rates, low deposit betas, and growth in our core earning asset balances. we also continued to experience growth in our fee-based businesses. the primary driver of the growth in noninterest income was investment banking and debt placement fees, which reached a new record level for the year of $603 million, driven by organic growth of almost 20%. cards and payments also added to our growth in noninterest income, increasing 23.2% from the prior year. in 2017, we reached over $400 million in annual run rate cost savings from the first niagara merger, with another $50 million expected to be realized by early 2018. expenses for the year were elevated as a result of the full-year impact of the first niagara acquisition, as well as higher expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2017. expenses for 2017 also included a number of notable items including merger-related charges and the impact of tax reform and related actions.
•   we saw continued strength in our credit quality trends during the year. for 2017, net loan charge-offs were .24% of average loans, down from .29% one year ago, and below our targeted range. over the past 12 months, net loan charge-offs increased $3 million. this increase is attributable to the growth in our loan portfolio and higher charge-offs in our consumer loan portfolios partially offset by an increase in recoveries in our commercial and industrial loan portfolio.
•   capital management remained a priority in 2017. on june 28, 2017, the federal reserve announced that it did not object to our 2017 capital plan submitted as part of the annual ccar process. the 2017 capital plan included share repurchases of up to $800 million, which is effective through the second quarter of 2018. during the third and fourth quarters of 2017, we completed $476 million of common share repurchases, including $469 million of common share repurchases in the open market and $7 million of common share repurchases related to employee equity compensation programs under the authorization. over the past five years, we have repurchased over $2.2 billion in common shares.
•   consistent with our 2016 capital plan, the board declared a quarterly dividend of $.085 per common share for the first quarter of 2017, and $.095 per common share for the second quarter of 2017. the board declared a quarterly dividend of $.095 per common share for the third quarter of 2017, and a quarterly dividend of $.105 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2017, consistent with our 2017 capital plan. these quarterly dividend payments brought our annual dividend to $.38 per common share for 2017. our 2017 capital plan proposed an increase in our quarterly common share dividend, up to $.12 per share, which will be considered by the board for the second quarter of 2018.

results of operations net interest income one of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income. net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets (such as loans and securities) and loan-related fee income, and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. there are several factors that affect net interest income, including:
•   the volume, pricing, mix, and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities;
•   the volume and value of net free funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity capital;
•   the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk;
•   interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace;
•   asset quality; and
•   fair value accounting of acquired earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.
to make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable, some not), we present net interest income in this discussion on a "te basis" (i.e., as if it were all taxable and at the same rate). for example, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $154, an amount that - if taxed at the 2017 statutory federal income tax rate of 35% - would yield $100.
figure 4 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense, and their respective yields or rates over the past five years. this figure also presents a reconciliation of te net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with gaap for each of those years. the net interest margin, which is an indicator of the profitability of the earning assets portfolio less cost of funding, is calculated by dividing taxable-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets.
te net interest income for 2017 was $3.8 billion, and the net interest margin was 3.17%, compared to te net interest income of $3.0 billion and a net interest margin of 2.92% for the prior year. 2017 reflects the full year benefit from the first niagara acquisition, including purchase accounting accretion, higher interest rates, low deposit betas, and growth in our core earning asset balances. te net interest income for 2016 increased $577 million from 2015 and the net interest margin increase by 4 basis points, reflecting the benefit from the first niagara acquisition and growth in our core earning asset balances and yields. in 2018, we expect net interest income to be in the range of $3.9 billion to $4.0 billion, with our outlook assuming one additional rate increase in june 2018.

(a)   average deposits for the years ended december 31, 2015, december 31, 2014, and december 31, 2013, exclude deposits in foreign office.
average loans totaled $86.4 billion for 2017, compared to $71.1 billion in 2016. this increase reflected the impact of the first niagara acquisition and growth in commercial and industrial loans. for 2018, we anticipate average loans to be in the range of $88.5 billion to $89.5 billion.
average earning assets totaled $120.8 billion for 2017, compared to $101.3 billion in 2016, reflecting the full year impact of the first niagara acquisition, as well as growth in commercial and industrial loans. at december 31, 2017, the remaining fair value discount on the first niagara acquired loan portfolio was $266 million.
average deposits totaled $102.9 billion for 2017, an increase of $16.6 billion compared to 2017, primarily reflecting the full year impact of the first niagara acquisition. in addition, we realized core deposit growth in 2017 driven by the strength of our retail banking franchise and from commercial clients, partly offset by the managed exit of higher cost corporate and public sector deposits. for 2018, we anticipate average deposits to be in the range of $104.5 billion to $105.5 billion.

provision for credit losses our provision for credit losses was $229 million for 2017, compared to $266 million for 2016. the decrease of $37 million in our provision for credit losses is related to a decrease in our alll taken during 2017 on our commercial loan portfolio when compared to the year prior, partially offset by a slight increase in our net loan charge-offs over the past twelve months. the commercial alll decreased due to a year over year reduction in loan outstandings as well as a decrease in classified and nonperforming loans. for 2016, the increase of $100 million in our provision for credit losses was primarily related to the addition of the acquired credit card and consumer direct portfolios, increased charge-offs, and loan growth. in 2018, we expect the provision to slightly exceed net loan charge-offs to provide for loan growth.
noninterest income noninterest income for 2017 was $2.5 billion, compared to $2.1 billion during 2016, and $1.9 billion during 2015. noninterest income represented 39% of total revenue for 2017, 41% of total revenue for 2016, and 44% of total revenue for 2015. in 2018, we expect noninterest income to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion.

the following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest income and the factors that caused those elements to change.
figure 6. noninterest income
(a)   other noninterest income includes operating lease income and other leasing gains, corporate services income, corporate-owned life insurance income, consumer mortgage income, mortgage servicing fees, net gains (losses) from principal investing, and other income. see the "consolidated statements of income" in part ii, item 8. financial statements and supplementary data of this report.
trust and investment services income trust and investment services income consists of brokerage commissions, trust and asset management commissions, and insurance income. for 2017, trust and investment services income increased $71 million, or 15.3%, from the prior year primarily due to an increase in insurance and brokerage commissions due to the full year impact of the first niagara acquisition and higher fees earned from investment management services as a result of stronger market performance. for 2016, trust and investment services income increased $31 million, or 7.2%, from the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of first niagara and higher insurance and brokerage commissions.
45
a significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management. at december 31, 2017, our bank, trust, and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of $39.6 billion, compared to $36.6 billion at december 31, 2016, and $34.0 billion at december 31, 2015. as shown in figure 7, the increase from 2016 to 2017 was primarily attributable to the market appreciation over the past twelve months. the increase from 2015 to 2016 was primarily attributable to the acquisition of first niagara.

investment banking and debt placement fees investment banking and debt placement fees consist of syndication fees, debt and equity financing fees, financial advisor fees, gains on sales of commercial mortgages, and agency origination fees. for 2017, investment banking and debt placement fees increased $121 million, or 25.1%, from the prior year due to growth in financial advisory, debt financing, and mortgage banking fees from our core franchise, as well as the acquisition of cain brothers in october 2017. for 2016, investment banking and debt placement fees increased $37 million, or 8.3%, from the prior year primarily driven by increased gains on the sale of commercial mortgages and agency origination fees, partially offset by a decrease in syndication fees.
cards and payments income cards and payments income, which consists of debit card, consumer and commercial credit card, and merchant services income, increased $54 million, or 23.2%, in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the acquisition of first niagara and higher volumes in atm debit card, purchase and pre-paid cards, and merchant services. cards and payments income increased $50 million, or 27.3%, in 2016 compared to 2015 due to the acquisition of first niagara and higher merchant services, purchase card, and atm debit card fees driven by increased volume.
service charges on deposit accounts service charges on deposit accounts increased $55 million, or 18%, in 2017 compared to the prior year primarily driven by the full-year impact of the first niagara acquisition and investments in commercial payments. service charges on deposit accounts increased $46 million, or 18%, in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the acquisition of first niagara.
other noninterest income other noninterest income includes operating lease income and other leasing gains, corporate services income, corporate-owned life insurance income, consumer mortgage income, mortgage servicing fees, net gains (losses) from principal investing, and other income. other noninterest income increased $106 million, or 18.0%, in 2017 compared to 2016. drivers include a full year impact of first niagara, a one-time gain related to key's merchant services acquisition in the second quarter of 2017, higher operating lease income originations, and growth from investments in the residential mortgage business. other noninterest income increased $27 million, or 4.8%, in 2016 compared to 2015, driven by the acquisition of first niagara, gains related to certain investments held by the real estate capital line of business, and changes in various miscellaneous income categories.
noninterest expense noninterest expense for 2017 was $4.1 billion, compared to $3.8 billion for 2016, and $2.8 billion for 2015. we recognized $217 million of merger-related charges in 2017 compared to $483 million of merger- and pension-related charges in 2016 and $61 million of merger-, pension-, and efficiency-related charges in 2015. figure 8 gives

personnel as shown in figure 10, personnel expense, the largest category of our noninterest expense, increased by $200 million, or 9.6%, in 2017 compared to 2016. the increase was primarily attributable to the full-year impact of the first niagara acquisition and the cain brothers acquisition in october 2017. in addition, there was higher incentive and stock-based compensation due to higher funding driven by business performance improvements of both cash based incentive plans and performance based stock awards.

income taxes we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of $637 million for 2017, compared to $179 million for 2016, and $303 million for 2015. the increase in tax provision from 2016 to 2017 was driven by the tcj act. the effective tax rate, which is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes, was 33.0% for 2017, compared to 18.5% for 2016, and 24.8% for 2015. in 2018, we expect our gaap tax rate to be in the range of 18% to 19%.
in 2017, our federal tax expense and effective tax rate differ from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate; primarily from investments in tax-advantaged assets, such as corporate-owned life insurance, tax credits associated with investments in low-income housing projects and energy related projects, periodic adjustments to our tax reserves, and the impact of the tcj act as described in note 14, income taxes.
in 2016, our effective tax rate was reduced due to lower pretax income resulting from merger-related charges, increased energy tax credits associated with leasing activities, and a reduction of valuation allowances related to capital loss carryforwards. in 2015, our effective tax rate was reduced due to additional federal tax credit refunds.

key community bank summary of operations as shown in figure 12, key community bank recorded net income attributable to key of $649 million for 2017, compared to $365 million for 2016, and $255 million for 2015. the increase in 2017 was primarily due to the acquisition of first niagara as well as growth in key's core businesses.
te net interest income increased in 2017 compared to 2016. the increase is primarily due to growth in both loan and deposit balances. the balance increases are primarily due to a full year impact of the first niagara acquisition. te net interest income also benefited from growth in core businesses, higher interest rates, and well-managed deposit betas.
noninterest income increased from 2016. the increase in 2017 was primarily due to a full-year impact of the first niagara acquisition as well as growth in key's core businesses. growth in key's core businesses included higher trust and investment services income due to market growth of assets under management, strength in cards and payments, and higher deposit service charges driven by investments in commercial payments. the increase in other income includes a one-time gain related to key's merchant services acquisition in the second quarter of 2017.
the provision for credit losses increased from 2016, primarily related to loan growth in 2017.
noninterest expense increased from 2016 primarily related to a full year impact of first niagara. in addition to the impact of first niagara, personnel expense increases are primarily related to on-going business investments and business acquisitions including hellowallet in the third quarter of 2017. nonpersonnel expense increased primarily due to on-going business investments and business acquisitions including hellowallet and key's merchant services acquisition in 2017.
in 2016, key community bank's net income attributable to key increased from the prior year. te net interest income increased from 2015. the positive contribution to net interest income is from loan and deposit growth related to the acquisition of first niagara and the increased value of deposits. noninterest income increased from 2015 driven by the acquisition of first niagara and includes higher service charges on deposits, higher cards and payments income due to higher merchant services, purchase card and atm debit card income, and higher trust and investment services income driven by higher insurance and brokerage commissions. the provision for loan and lease losses increased from 2015 primarily related to the addition of acquired first niagara loan portfolios and loan growth. noninterest expense increased from 2015. personnel expense increased primarily related to the addition of first niagara employees. nonpersonnel expense increased primarily due to higher intangible amortization expense, fdic assessment expense, and other various expenses related to the acquisition of first niagara.

key corporate bank summary of operations as shown in figure 13, key corporate bank recorded net income attributable to key of $814 million for 2017, compared to $628 million for 2016 and $544 million for 2015. the 2017 increase was driven by an increase in revenue and lower provision for credit losses, but slightly offset by higher noninterest expense.
te net interest income increased in 2017 compared to 2016. this increase is primarily due to growth in both loan and deposit balances. the balance increases are due to a full year impact of the first niagara acquisition as well as growth in core businesses.
noninterest income increased from 2016. the majority of the increase is related to growth in investment banking and debt placement fees, with growth in financial advisory, debt capital markets, and mortgage banking fees from our core key franchise as well as the fourth quarter acquisition of cain brothers. operating lease income and other leasing gains increased due to higher originations. cards and payments income increased due to higher volumes in purchase and pre-paid card and merchant services. slightly offsetting these increases is a decline in other noninterest income mostly driven by impairments and lower gains related to certain investments held by the real estate capital line of business.
the provision for credit losses decreased from 2016, primarily due to lower net loan charge-offs and lower provisioning related to improving credit quality in the overall portfolio.
noninterest expense increased from 2016. personnel expense increased due to higher salaries, incentive compensation, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense partially related to the acquisition of cain brothers as well as higher performance-based compensation. nonpersonnel expense increased due to higher operating lease expense, cards and payments processing, and other various expenses related to the acquisition of cain brothers.
in 2016, key corporate bank's net income attributable to key increased from the prior year. te net interest income increased compared to 2015, due to higher balances related to the first niagara acquisition and growth in core businesses. noninterest income increased due to growth in investment banking and debt placement fees, other noninterest income, and cards and payments income. the provision for credit losses increased primarily due to increased net loan charge-offs. noninterest expense increased due to higher salaries, incentive compensation, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense largely related to the acquisition of first niagara as well as higher performance-based compensation, higher operating lease expense, cards and payments processing, fdic assessment, and other various expenses related to the acquisition of first niagara.

commercial and industrial. commercial and industrial loans are the largest component of our loan portfolio, representing 48% of our total loan portfolio at december 31, 2017, and 46% at december 31, 2016. this portfolio is approximately 83% variable rate and consists of loans originated in both key corporate and community bank to large corporate, middle market, and small business clients.
commercial and industrial loans totaled $41.9 billion at december 31, 2017, an increase of $2.1 billion compared to december 31, 2016, driven by increases in the business products, commercial real estate, consumer services, and transportation industries, which combined, accounted for approximately 28% of the total portfolio mix at december 31, 2017.
commercial real estate loans. our commercial real estate lending business includes both mortgage and construction loans, and is conducted through two primary sources: our 15-state banking franchise, and keybank

real estate capital, a national line of business that cultivates relationships with owners of commercial real estate located both within and beyond the branch system. approximately 70% of loans outstanding at december 31, 2017, were generated by our keybank real estate capital line of business. nonowner-occupied properties, generally properties for which at least 50% of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties, represented 79% of total commercial real estate loans outstanding at december 31, 2017. construction loans, which provide a stream of funding for properties not fully leased at origination to support debt service payments over the term of the contract or project, represented 12% of commercial real estate loans at year end.
at december 31, 2017, commercial real estate loans totaled $16.0 billion, comprised of $14.1 billion of mortgage loans and $1.9 billion of construction loans. compared to december 31, 2016, this portfolio decreased $1.4 billion, largely the result of reductions in commercial mortgages, which declined $1.0 billion, reflecting significantly higher debt placements and paydowns in 2017. we continue to focus primarily on owners of completed and stabilized commercial real estate in accordance with our relationship strategy.
as shown in figure 16, our commercial real estate loan portfolio includes various property types and geographic locations of the underlying collateral. these loans include commercial mortgage and construction loans in both key community bank and key corporate bank. as a result of the first niagara acquisition, we have an increased concentration of commercial real estate loans in the northeast region.

56
modifications are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the same time meeting our clients' financing needs. in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, a loan is classified as a tdr only when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a creditor concession has been granted.
in the case of loan extensions where either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or a concession has been made, we would analyze such credit under the applicable accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a tdr. if commercial loan terms are extended at less than normal market rates for similar lending arrangements, our asset recovery group is consulted to help determine if any concession granted would result in designation as a tdr. transfer to our asset recovery group is considered for any loan determined to be a tdr. during 2017, we had $89 million of new tdr commercial loans compared to $37 million of new tdr commercial loans in 2016. consumer loans modifications are handled centrally by our default management team. in addition to consumer modifications that result in a credit concession, we also classify consumer loans discharged in bankruptcy as a tdr. during 2017, we had $41 million of new tdr consumer loans compared to $34 million of new tdr consumer loans in 2016.

restructured nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status based on a current, well-documented evaluation of the credit, which would include analysis of the borrower's financial condition, prospects for repayment under the modified terms, and alternate sources of repayment such as the value of loan collateral. we consider the borrower's ability to perform under the modified terms for a reasonable period (generally a minimum of six months) before returning the loan to accrual status. sustained historical repayment performance prior to the restructuring also may be taken into account. the primary consideration for returning a tdr loan to accrual status is the reasonable assurance that the full contractual principal balance of the loan and the ongoing contractually required interest payments will be fully repaid. although our policy is a guideline, considerable judgment is required to review each borrower's circumstances. because economic conditions have improved modestly and we have restructured loans to provide the optimal opportunity for successful repayment by the borrower, certain of our tdr loans have returned to accrual status and consistently performed under the restructured loan terms over the past year.
additional information regarding tdrs is provided in note 6 ("asset quality").
extensions. project loans typically are refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at maturity, but they are often modified and extended. extension terms take into account the specific circumstances of the client relationship, the status of the project, and near-term prospects for the client, the repayment source, and the collateral. in all cases, pricing and loan structure are reviewed and, where necessary, modified to ensure the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of return and loan terms that are appropriate for the risk. typical enhancements include one or more of the following: principal pay down, increased amortization, additional collateral, increased guarantees, and a cash flow sweep. some maturing loans have automatic extension options built in; in those cases, pricing and loan terms cannot be altered.
loan pricing is determined based on the strength of the borrowing entity, the strength of the guarantor, if any, and the structure and residual risk of the transaction. therefore, pricing for an extended loan may remain the same because the loan is already priced at or above current market. extensions that qualify as tdrs are measured for impairment under the applicable accounting guidance.
57
guarantors. we conduct a detailed guarantor analysis (1) for all new extensions of credit, (2) at the time of any material modification/extension, and (3) typically annually, as part of our on-going portfolio and loan monitoring procedures. this analysis requires the guarantor entity to submit all appropriate financial statements, including balance sheets, income statements, tax returns, and real estate schedules.
while the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may vary, the high-level objectives include determining the overall financial conditions of the guarantor entities, including size, quality, and nature of asset base; net worth (adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value); leverage; standing liquidity; recurring cash flow; contingent and direct debt obligations; and near-term debt maturities.
borrower and guarantor financial statements are required at least annually within 90-120 days of the calendar/fiscal year end. income statements and rent rolls for project collateral are required quarterly. we may require certain information, such as liquidity, certifications, status of asset sales or debt resolutions, and real estate schedules, to be provided more frequently.
we routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt if the guarantor is solvent. we may not seek to enforce the guaranty if we are precluded by bankruptcy or we determine the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to be returned given the guarantor's verified financial condition. we often are successful in obtaining either monetary payment or the cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss, cost, and the expense of collections.
mortgage and construction loans with a loan-to-value ratio greater than 1.0 may be accounted for as performing loans. these loans may not be considered impaired due to one or more of the following factors: (i) underlying cash flow adequate to service the debt at a market rate of return with adequate amortization; (ii) a satisfactory borrower payment history; and (iii) acceptable guarantor support. as of december 31, 2017, we did not have any mortgage and construction loans that had a loan-to-value ratio greater than 1.0.
consumer loan portfolio consumer loans outstanding at december 31, 2017, totaled $23.7 billion, a decrease of $457 million, or 1.9%, from one year ago. the decrease in consumer loans was driven by continued declines in the home equity loan portfolio, largely the result of paydowns in home equity lines of credit, partly offset by growth in indirect auto lending.
home equity loans are the largest component of our consumer loan portfolio, representing approximately 51% of consumer loans outstanding at year end. approximately 99% of this portfolio at december 31, 2017, was originated by our key community bank within our 15-state footprint.
as shown in figure 12, we held the first lien position for approximately 60% of the key community bank home equity portfolio at december 31, 2017, and 57% at december 31, 2016. for loans with real estate collateral, we track borrower performance monthly. regardless of the lien position, credit metrics are refreshed quarterly, including recent fair isaac corporation scores as well as original and updated loan-to-value ratios. this information is used in establishing the alll. our methodology is described in note 1 ("summary of significant accounting policies") under the heading "allowance for loan and lease losses."
loan sales as shown in figure 18, which summarizes our loan sales for 2017 and 2016, during 2017, we sold $12.0 billion of our loans. commercial real estate loan sales in 2017 increased $3.3 billion from 2016, due to organic growth and increased collaboration within our lines of business. most of these sales came from the held-for-sale portfolio; however, $183 million of these loan sales related to the held-to-maturity portfolio in 2017.
among the factors that we consider in determining which loans to sell are:
•   our business strategy for particular lending areas;
•   whether particular lending businesses meet established performance standards or fit with our relationship banking strategy;
•   our a/lm needs;
•   the cost of alternative funding sources;
•   the level of credit risk;
58
•   capital requirements; and
•   market conditions and pricing.

in the event of default by a borrower, we are subject to recourse with respect to approximately $3.3 billion of the $245.6 billion of loans administered or serviced at december 31, 2017. additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in note 22 ("commitments, contingent liabilities, and guarantees") under the heading "recourse agreement with fnma."
we derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold. we earn noninterest income (recorded as "mortgage servicing fees") from fees for servicing or administering loans. this fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets. in addition, we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing loans. additional information about our mortgage servicing assets is included in note 10 ("mortgage servicing assets").

securities our securities portfolio totaled $30.0 billion at december 31, 2017, compared to $30.4 billion at december 31, 2016. available-for-sale securities were $18.1 billion at december 31, 2017, compared to $20.2 billion at december 31, 2016. held-to-maturity securities were $11.8 billion at december 31, 2017, compared to $10.2 billion at december 31, 2016.
as shown in figure 21, all of our mortgage-backed securities, which include both securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, are issued by government-sponsored enterprises or gnma, and are traded in liquid secondary markets. these securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value for the available-for-sale portfolio and at cost for the held-to-maturity portfolio. for more information about these securities, see note 7 ("fair value measurements") under the heading "qualitative disclosures of valuation techniques," and note 8 ("securities").

(a)   includes securities held in the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios.
securities available for sale the majority of our securities available-for-sale portfolio consists of federal agency cmos and mortgage-backed securities. cmos are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. these mortgage securities generate interest income, serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements, and provide liquidity value under regulatory requirements.
we periodically evaluate our securities available-for-sale portfolio in light of established a/lm objectives, changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio, the regulatory environment, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. these evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning.
in addition, the size and composition of our securities available-for-sale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required (or elect) to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits. although we generally use debt securities for this purpose, other assets, such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit, are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles.
our investing activities continue to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs. our actions to not reinvest the monthly security cash flows at various times served to provide the liquidity necessary to address our funding requirements. these funding requirements included ongoing loan growth and occasional debt maturities. at other times, we may make additional investments that go beyond the replacement of maturities or mortgage security cash flows as our liquidity position and/or interest rate risk management strategies may require. lastly, our focus on investing in high quality liquid assets, including gnma-related securities, is related to liquidity management strategies to satisfy regulatory requirements.

other investments principal investments - investments in equity and debt instruments made by our principal investing unit - represented 19% and 25% of other investments at december 31, 2017, and december 31, 2016, respectively. they include direct investments (investments made in a particular company) as well as indirect investments (investments made through funds that include other investors). principal investments are predominantly made in privately held companies and are carried at fair value. the fair value of the direct investments was $13 million at december 31, 2017, and $27 million at december 31, 2016, while the fair value of the indirect investments was $124 million at december 31, 2017, and $158 million at december 31, 2016. under the requirements of the volcker rule, we will be required to dispose of some or all of our indirect investments. for more information about the volcker rule, see the discussion in item 1 under the heading "other regulatory developments under the dodd-frank act - 'volcker rule'" in the section entitled "supervision and regulation."
most of our other investments are not traded on an active market. we determine the fair value at which these investments should be recorded based on the nature of the specific investment and all available relevant information. this review may encompass such factors as the issuer's past financial performance and future potential, the values of public companies in comparable businesses, the risks associated with the particular business or investment type, current market conditions, the nature and duration of resale restrictions, the issuer's payment history, our knowledge of the industry, third-party data, and other relevant factors. as of december 31, 2017, net gains from our principal investing activities (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) totaled $7 million, which includes $12 million of net unrealized losses. these net gains are recorded as "net gains (losses) from principal investing" on the income statement. additional information regarding these investments is provided in note 7.
deposits and other sources of funds domestic deposits are our primary source of funding. the composition of our average deposits is shown in figure 4 in the section entitled "net interest income." during 2017, average domestic deposits were $102.9 billion and represented 85% of the funds we used to support loans and other earning assets, compared to $86.4 billion and 85% during 2016. noninterest-bearing deposits make up approximately 30% of our deposit mix and provides an alternative to higher cost funding sources. the $16.6 billion increase in domestic deposits compared to the prior year reflects the full year impact of the first niagara acquisition. in addition, we realized core deposit growth in 2017 driven by the strength of our retail banking franchise and from commercial clients, partly offset by the managed exit of higher cost corporate and public sector deposits.
wholesale funds, consisting of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, averaged $13.6 billion during 2017, compared to $11.1 billion during 2016. the increase from the prior year reflects the full year impact of the first niagara acquisition and an increase in long-term debt issuances.
figure 24 shows the maturity distribution of time deposits of $100,000 or more. all of our time deposits at december 31, 2017, were domestic deposits.

capital the objective of management of capital is to maintain capital levels consistent with our risk appetite and sufficient in size to operate within a wide range of operating environments. we have identified four primary uses of capital:
1.   investing in our businesses, supporting our clients, and loan growth;
62
2.   maintaining or increasing our common share dividend;
3.   returning capital in the form of common share repurchases to our shareholders; and
4.   remaining disciplined and opportunistic about how we invest in our franchise to include selective acquisitions over time.
the following sections discuss certain ways we have deployed our capital. for further information, see the consolidated statements of changes in equity and note 24 ("shareholders' equity").
(a)   common share repurchases were suspended during the third quarter of 2015 due to the then pending merger with first niagara. we resumed our common share repurchase program during the third quarter of 2016 upon the completion of the first niagara merger.
dividends consistent with our 2016 capital plan, the board declared a quarterly dividend of $.085 per common share for the first quarter of 2017, and $.095 per common share for the second quarter of 2017. the board declared a quarterly dividend of $.095 per common share for the third quarter of 2017, and a quarterly dividend of $.105 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2017, consistent with our 2017 capital plan. these quarterly dividend payments brought our annual dividend to $.38 per common share for 2017.
during 2017, we made the following dividend payments on our preferred stock:
•   $1.9375 per share, or $6 million, during the first quarter of 2017 on our series a preferred stock;
•   $.539063 per share, or $7 million, during the first quarter of 2017 on our series c preferred stock;
•   $12.50 per depositary share, or $26 million, during the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of 2017 on our series d preferred stock; and
•   $.395573 per depositary share, or $8 million, during the first quarter of 2017 and $.382813 per depositary share, or $23 million, during the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2017, on our series e preferred stock.
common shares outstanding our common shares are traded on the nyse under the symbol key with 36,126 holders of record at december 31, 2017. our book value per common share was $13.09 based on 1.069 billion shares outstanding at december 31, 2017, compared to $12.58 based on 1.079 billion shares outstanding at december 31, 2016. at december 31, 2017, our tangible book value per common share was $10.35, compared to $9.99 at december 31, 2016.
figure 41 in the section entitled "fourth quarter results" shows the market price ranges of our common shares, per common share earnings, and dividends paid by quarter for each of the last two years.
figure 25 compares the price performance of our common shares (based on an initial investment of $100 on december 31, 2012, and assuming reinvestment of dividends) with that of the standard & poor's 500 index and a group of other banks that constitute our peer group. the peer group consists of the banks that make up the standard & poor's 500 regional bank index and the banks that make up the standard & poor's 500 diversified bank index. we are included in the standard & poor's 500 index and the peer group.

during 2017, common shares outstanding decreased by 10.2 million shares due to common share repurchases under our 2016 and 2017 capital plans.
at december 31, 2017, we had 187.6 million treasury shares, compared to 177.4 million treasury shares at december 31, 2016. going forward, we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stock-based compensation awards and for other corporate purposes.
capital adequacy capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance. all of our capital ratios remained in excess of regulatory requirements at december 31, 2017. our capital and liquidity levels are intended to position us to weather an adverse operating environment while continuing to serve our clients' needs, as well as to meet the regulatory capital rules described in the "supervision and regulation" section of item 1 of this report. our shareholders' equity to assets ratio was 10.91% at december 31, 2017, compared to 11.17% at december 31, 2016. our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.23% at december 31, 2017, compared to 8.09% at december 31, 2016. the new minimum capital and leverage ratios under the regulatory capital rules together with the estimated ratios of keycorp at december 31, 2017, calculated on a fully phased-in basis, are set forth under the heading "basel iii" in the "supervision and regulation" section in item 1 of this report.

off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations off-balance sheet arrangements we are party to various types of off-balance sheet arrangements, which could lead to contingent liabilities or risks of loss that are not reflected on the balance sheet.
variable interest entities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations, we consolidate a vie if we have: (i) a variable interest in the entity; (ii) the power to direct activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance; and (iii) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie (i.e., we are considered to be the primary beneficiary). additional information regarding the nature of vies and our involvement with them is included in note 1 ("summary of significant accounting policies") under the heading "basis of presentation," and in note 13 ("variable interest entities").

commitments to extend credit or funding loan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the client continues to meet specified criteria. these commitments generally carry variable rates of interest and have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. we typically charge a fee for our loan commitments. since a commitment may expire without resulting in a loan or being fully utilized, the total amount of an outstanding commitment may significantly exceed any related cash outlay. further information about our loan commitments at december 31, 2017, is presented in note 22 ("commitments, contingent liabilities, and guarantees") under the heading "commitments to extend credit or funding." figure 28 shows the remaining contractual amount of each class of commitment to extend credit or funding. for loan commitments and commercial letters of credit, this amount represents our maximum possible accounting loss on the unused commitment if the borrower were to draw upon the full amount of the commitment and subsequently default on payment for the total amount of the then outstanding loan.
other off-balance sheet arrangements other off-balance sheet arrangements include financial instruments that do not meet the definition of a guarantee in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, and other relationships, such as liquidity support provided to asset-backed commercial paper conduits, indemnification agreements and intercompany guarantees. information about such arrangements is provided in note 22 under the heading "other off-balance sheet risk."
contractual obligations figure 28 summarizes our significant contractual obligations, and lending-related and other off-balance sheet commitments at december 31, 2017, by the specific time periods in which related payments are due or commitments expire.

guarantees we are a guarantor in various agreements with third parties. as guarantor, we may be contingently liable to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in a specified interest rate, foreign exchange rate or other variable (including the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event). these variables, known as underlyings, may be related to an asset or liability, or another entity's failure to perform under a contract. additional information regarding these types of arrangements is presented in note 22 under the heading "guarantees."
risk management overview like all financial services companies, we engage in business activities and assume the related risks. the most significant risks we face are credit, compliance, operational, liquidity, market, reputation, strategic, and model risks. our risk management activities are focused on ensuring we properly identify, measure, and manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability. certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section.
the board serves in an oversight capacity ensuring that key's risks are managed in a manner that is effective and balanced and adds value for the shareholders. the board understands key's risk philosophy, approves the risk appetite, inquires about risk practices, reviews the portfolio of risks, compares the actual risks to the risk appetite, and is apprised of significant risks, both actual and emerging, and determines whether management is responding appropriately. the board challenges management and ensures accountability.
the board's audit committee assists the board in oversight of financial statement integrity, regulatory and legal requirements, independent auditors' qualifications and independence, and the performance of the internal audit function and independent auditors. the audit committee meets with management and approves significant policies relating to the risk areas overseen by the audit committee. the audit committee has responsibility over all risk review functions, including internal audit, as well as financial reporting, legal matters, and fraud risk. the audit committee also receives reports on enterprise risk. in addition to regularly scheduled bi-monthly meetings, the audit committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases.
the board's risk committee assists the board in oversight of strategies, policies, procedures, and practices relating to the assessment and management of enterprise-wide risk, including credit, market, liquidity, model, operational, compliance, reputation, and strategic risks. the risk committee also assists the board in overseeing risks related to capital adequacy, capital planning, and capital actions. the risk committee reviews and provides oversight of management's activities related to the enterprise-wide risk management framework, which includes review of the erm policy, including the risk appetite statement, and management and erm reports. the risk committee also approves any material changes to the charter of the erm committee and significant policies relating to risk management.
the audit and risk committees meet jointly, as appropriate, to discuss matters that relate to each committee's responsibilities. committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting. all members of the board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months.
our erm committee, chaired by the chief executive officer and comprising other senior level executives, is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. the erm program encompasses our risk philosophy, policy, framework, and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company. the erm committee reports to the board's risk committee. annually, the board reviews and approves the erm policy, as well as the risk appetite, including corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories. we use a risk-adjusted capital framework to manage risks. this framework is approved and managed by the erm committee.
tier 2 risk governance committees support the erm committee by identifying early warning events and trends, escalating emerging risks, and discussing forward-looking assessments. risk governance committees include attendees from each of the three lines of defense. the first line of defense is the line of business primarily responsible to accept, own, proactively identify, monitor, and manage risk. the second line of defense comprises
67
risk management representatives who provide independent, centralized oversight over all risk categories by aggregating, analyzing, and reporting risk information. risk review, our internal audit function, provides the third line of defense in their role to provide independent assessment and testing of the effectiveness, appropriateness, and adherence to keycorp's risk management policies, practices, and controls. the chief risk officer ensures that relevant risk information is properly integrated into strategic and business decisions, ensures appropriate ownership of risks, provides input into performance and compensation decisions, assesses aggregate enterprise risk, monitors capabilities to manage critical risks, and executes appropriate board and stakeholder reporting.
federal banking regulators continue to emphasize with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution. we believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks, and conform to regulatory expectations.
market risk management market risk is the risk that movements in market risk factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, credit spreads, and volatilities will reduce key's income and the value of its portfolios. these factors influence prospective yields, values, or prices associated with the instrument.
we are exposed to market risk both in our trading and nontrading activities, which include asset and liability management activities. our trading positions are carried at fair value with changes recorded in the income statement. these positions are subject to various market-based risk factors that impact the fair value of the financial instruments in the trading category. information regarding our fair value policies, procedures, and methodologies is provided in note 1 ("summary of significant accounting policies") under the heading "fair value measurements" and note 7 ("fair value measurements") in this report. our traditional banking loan and deposit products as well as long-term debt and certain short-term borrowings are nontrading positions. these positions are generally carried at the principal amount outstanding for assets and the amount owed for liabilities. the nontrading positions are subject to changes in economic value due to varying market conditions, primarily changes in interest rates.
trading market risk key incurs market risk as a result of trading activities that are used in support of client facilitation and hedging activities, principally within our investment banking and capital markets businesses. key has exposures to a wide range of risk factors including interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and commodity prices, as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads. our primary market risk exposures are a result of trading and hedging activities in the derivative and fixed income markets, including securitization exposures. at year end, we did not have any re-securitization positions. we maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow, make markets in securities, and hedge certain risks including but not limited to credit risk and interest rate risk. the risks associated with these activities are mitigated in accordance with the market risk hedging policy.  the majority of our positions are traded in active markets.
management of trading market risks. market risk management is an integral part of key's risk culture. the risk committee of our board provides oversight of trading market risks. the erm committee and the market risk committee regularly review and discuss market risk reports prepared by our mrm that contain our market risk exposures and results of monitoring activities. market risk policies and procedures have been defined and approved by the market risk committee, a tier 2 risk governance committee, and take into account our tolerance for risk and consideration for the business environment.
the mrm, as the second line of defense, is an independent risk management function that partners with the lines of business to identify, measure, and monitor market risks throughout our company. the mrm is responsible for ensuring transparency of significant market risks, monitoring compliance with established limits, and escalating limit exceptions to appropriate senior management. the various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well-managed and prudent. market risk is monitored through various measures, such as var, and through routine stress testing, sensitivity, and scenario analyses. the mrm conducts stress tests for each position using historical worst case and standard shock scenarios. var, stressed var, and other analyses are prepared daily and distributed to appropriate management.
covered positions.  we monitor the market risk of our covered positions as defined in the market risk rule, which includes all of our trading positions as well as all foreign exchange and commodity positions, regardless of whether
68
the position is in a trading account. key's covered positions may also include mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities that may be identified as securitization positions or re-securitization positions under the market risk rule. mrm as well as the lob that trades securitization positions monitor the positions, the portfolio composition and the risks identified in this section on a daily basis consistent with the market risk policies and procedures. at year end, covered positions did not include any re-securitization positions. instruments that are used to hedge nontrading activities, such as bank-issued debt and loan portfolios, equity positions that are not actively traded, and securities financing activities, do not meet the definition of a covered position. the mrm is responsible for identifying our portfolios as either covered or non-covered. the covered position working group develops the final list of covered positions, and a summary is provided to the market risk committee.
our significant portfolios of covered positions are detailed below. we analyze market risk by portfolios of covered positions, and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type. the descriptions below incorporate the respective risk types associated with each of these portfolios.
•   fixed income includes those instruments associated with our capital markets business and the trading of securities as a dealer. these instruments may include positions in municipal bonds, bonds backed by the u.s. government, agency and corporate bonds, certain mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, securities issued by the u.s. treasury, money markets, and certain cmos. the activities and instruments within the fixed income portfolio create exposures to interest rate and credit spread risks.
•   interest rate derivatives include interest rate swaps, caps, and floors, which are transacted primarily to accommodate the needs of commercial loan clients. in addition, we enter into interest rate derivatives to offset or mitigate the interest rate risk related to the client positions. the activities within this portfolio create exposures to interest rate risk.
var and stressed var.  var is the estimate of the maximum amount of loss on an instrument or portfolio due to adverse market conditions during a given time interval within a stated confidence level. stressed var is used to assess extreme conditions on market risk within our trading portfolios. the mrm calculates var and stressed var on a daily basis, and the results are distributed to appropriate management. var and stressed var results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations.
we use a historical simulation var model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions and other non-covered positions. historical scenarios are customized for specific positions, and numerous risk factors are incorporated in the calculation. additional consideration is given to the risk factors to estimate the exposures that contain optionality features, such as options and cancelable provisions. var is calculated using daily observations over a one-year time horizon, and approximates a 95% confidence level. statistically, this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than var, on average, five out of 100 trading days, or three to four times each quarter. we also calculate var and stressed var at a 99% confidence level.
the var model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of possible gains and losses on our positions. however, there are limitations inherent in the var model since it uses historical results over a given time interval to estimate future performance. historical results may not be indicative of future results, and changes in the market or composition of our portfolios could have a significant impact on the accuracy of the var model. we regularly review and enhance the modeling techniques, inputs and assumptions used. our market risk policy includes the independent validation of our var model by key's internal model validation group on an annual basis. the model risk management committee oversees the model validation program, and results of validations are discussed with the erm committee.
actual losses for the total covered positions did not exceed aggregate daily var on any day during the quarters ended december 31, 2017, and december 31, 2016. the mrm backtests our var model on a daily basis to evaluate its predictive power. the test compares var model results at the 99% confidence level to daily held profit and loss. results of backtesting are provided to the market risk committee. backtesting exceptions occur when trading losses exceed var. we do not engage in correlation trading, or utilize the internal model approach for measuring default and credit migration risk. our net var approach incorporates diversification, but our var calculation does not include the impact of counterparty risk and our own credit spreads on derivatives.
the aggregate var at the 99% confidence level with a one day holding period for all covered positions was $.7 million at december 31, 2017, and $1.9 million at december 31, 2016. the decrease in aggregate var was primarily due to the lower inventories and the composition of our fixed income portfolio. additionally, starting with the
69
third quarter of 2017, the aggregate var does not include the var for the credit derivatives that represented the hedging activities for the commercial real estate warehouse portfolio. these activities are no longer considered as covered portfolio. figure 29 summarizes our var at the 99% confidence level with a one day holding period for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended december 31, 2017, and december 31, 2016. during this period, none of our significant portfolios daily trading var numbers exceeded their var limits or stress var limits.

internal capital adequacy assessment.  market risk is a component of our internal capital adequacy assessment. our risk-weighted assets include a market risk-equivalent asset amount, which consists of a var component, stressed var component, a de minimis exposure amount, and a specific risk add-on including the securitization positions. the aggregate market value of the securitization positions as defined by the market risk rule was $44.5 million at december 31, 2017. this amount included $35.3 million or mortgage-backed securities positions and $9.2 million of asset-backed securities positions. specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments, which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors and is measured through a standardized approach. market risk weighted assets, including the specific risk calculations are run quarterly by the mrm in accordance with the market risk rule, and approved by the chief market risk officer.
nontrading market risk most of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products, as well as investments, hedging relationships, long-term debt, and certain short-term borrowings. interest rate risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the eve. such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. we manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the eve in accordance with our risk appetite and in accordance with the board approved erm policy.
interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of customer preferences for loan and deposit products, economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets, changes in market interest rates that affect client activity, and our hedging, investing, funding, and capital positions. the primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of reprice risk, basis risk, yield curve risk, and option risk.
70
•   "reprice risk" is the exposure to changes in the level of interest rates and occurs when the volume of interest-bearing liabilities and the volume of interest-earning assets they fund (e.g., deposits used to fund loans) do not mature or reprice at the same time.
•   "basis risk" is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indexes and occurs when floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities reprice at the same time, but in response to different market factors or indexes.
•   "yield curve risk" is the exposure to non-parallel changes in the slope of the yield curve (where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity) and occurs when interest-bearing liabilities and the interest-earning assets that they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve.
•   "option risk" is the exposure to a customer or counterparty's ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets, liabilities, or off-balance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity without a penalty. option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation.
the management of nontrading market risk is centralized within corporate treasury. the risk committee of our board provides oversight of nontrading market risk. the erm committee and the alco review reports on the interest rate risk exposures described above. in addition, the alco reviews reports on stress tests and sensitivity analyses related to interest rate risk. these committees have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk, including recommending, approving, and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges. the a/lm policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the alco. the mrm, as the second line of defense, provides additional oversight.
net interest income simulation analysis.  the primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis. for purposes of this analysis, we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on- and off-balance sheet positions, accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity. the analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments, and balance sheet growth projections based on a most likely macroeconomic view. the results of simulation analysis reflect management's desired interest rate risk positioning. the modeling incorporates investment portfolio and swap portfolio balances consistent with management's desired interest rate risk positioning. the simulation model estimates the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if interest rates were to gradually increase or decrease over the next 12 months. our standard rate scenarios encompass a gradual, parallel increase or decrease of 200 basis points, but due to the low interest rate environment, we have modified the standard decrease scenario to a gradual, parallel decrease of 125 basis points over eight months with no change over the following four months. after calculating the amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes, we compare that amount with the net interest income generated in an unchanged interest rate environment.
figure 31 presents the results of the simulation analysis at december 31, 2017, and december 31, 2016. at december 31, 2017, our simulated impact to changes in interest rates was moderately asset-sensitive. in 2017, the federal reserve increased the range for the federal funds target rate, which led to an increase in the magnitude of the declining rate scenario to 125 basis points. tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual, parallel 200 basis point increase or 125 basis point decrease in interest rates over the next 12 months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 5.5%. as a result of the federal reserve's 2017 interest rate increases, our modeled exposure to declining rates increased.

simulation analysis produces a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on assumptions input into the model. we tailor certain assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled, and validate those assumptions on a regular basis. however, actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition, customer behavior, product pricing, market interest rates, changes in management's desired interest rate risk positioning, investment, funding and hedging activities, and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events.
we also perform regular stress tests and sensitivity analyses on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments. assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve, including steepening or flattening of the yield curve, immediate changes in market interest rates, and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates. assessments are also performed on changes to the following assumptions: loan and deposit balances, the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities, changes in lending spreads, prepayments on loans and securities, investment, funding and hedging activities, and liquidity and capital management strategies.
the results of additional assessments indicate that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in figure 31. net interest income is highly dependent on the timing, magnitude, frequency, and path of interest rate increases and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships, lending spreads, and the balance behavior of transaction accounts. if fixed rate assets increase by $1 billion, or fixed rate liabilities decrease by $1 billion, then the benefit to rising rates would decrease by approximately 30 basis points. if the interest bearing liquid deposit beta assumption increases or decreases by 5% (e.g. 40% to 45%), then the benefit to rising rates would decrease or increase by approximately 90 basis points.
our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume, mix, maturity, and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows. treasury discretionary activities related to funding, investing, and hedging may also change as a result of changes in customer business flows, or changes in management's desired interest rate risk positioning. as changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy, management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile.
we also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a three-year horizon. these simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a 12-month horizon. to capture longer-term exposures, we calculate exposures to changes of the eve as discussed in the following section.
economic value of equity modeling. eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond 12-, 24-, and 36-month horizons. eve modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, measuring the resulting change in the values of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet instruments, and comparing those amounts with the base case of the current interest rate environment. because the calculation of eve under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates in the current low rate environment results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points, we have modified the standard declining rate scenario to an immediate 125 basis point decrease. this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities. those assumptions are based on historical behaviors, as well as our expectations. we develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our eve will decrease by more than 15% in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates. we are operating within these guidelines as of december 31, 2017.
management of interest rate exposure. we use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate a/lm strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures. specifically, we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities, issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates, and using derivatives - predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps, which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities.
figure 32 shows all swap positions that we hold for a/lm purposes. these positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. for example, fixed-rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a "receive fixed/pay variable"
72
interest rate swap. the volume, maturity, and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader a/lm objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. for more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile, see note 9 ("derivatives and hedging activities").

liquidity risk management liquidity risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by our ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund new business opportunities at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, and without adverse consequences. liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions.
governance structure we manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis. this approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity, as well as each entity's capacity to manage through adverse conditions. the approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding.
the management of consolidated liquidity risk is centralized within corporate treasury. oversight and governance is provided by the board, the erm committee, the alco, and the chief risk officer. the asset liability management policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of liquidity risk and is administered by the alco. the mrm, as the second line of defense, provides additional oversight. our current liquidity risk management practices are in compliance with the federal reserve board's enhanced prudential standards.
these committees regularly review liquidity and funding summaries, liquidity trends, peer comparisons, variance analyses, liquidity projections, hypothetical funding erosion stress tests, and goal tracking reports. the reviews generate a discussion of positions, trends, and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of our decisions. when liquidity pressure is elevated, positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive. to ensure that emerging issues are identified, we also communicate with individuals inside and outside of the company on a daily basis.
factors affecting liquidity our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events. an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency. examples of indirect events (events unrelated to us) that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war, natural disasters, political events, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund or hedge fund. similarly, market speculation, or rumors about us or the banking industry in general, may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources.
our credit ratings at december 31, 2017, are shown in figure 33. we believe these credit ratings, under normal conditions in the capital markets, will enable keycorp or keybank to issue fixed income securities to investors.

we regularly monitor our liquidity position and funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of hypothetical scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding. in the normal course of business, we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both keycorp and keybank. in a "heightened monitoring mode," we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently, and use assumptions to reflect the changed market environment. our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies. erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods. ultimately, they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations. to compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures, we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed.
we maintain a contingency funding plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis. the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions. it also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for managing liquidity through a problem period. as part of the plan, we maintain on-balance sheet liquid reserves referred to as our liquid asset portfolio, which consists of high quality liquid assets. during a problem period, that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longer-term strategy. the liquid asset portfolio at december 31, 2017, totaled $27.2 billion, consisting of $22.8 billion of unpledged securities, $290 million of securities available for secured funding at the fhlb, and $4.1 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our federal reserve account. the liquid asset portfolio can fluctuate due to excess liquidity, heightened risk, or prefunding of expected outflows, such as debt maturities. additionally, as of december 31, 2017, our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was $23.8 billion at the federal reserve bank of cleveland and $6.3 billion at the fhlb of cincinnati. in 2017, key's outstanding fhlb of cincinnati advances increased by $980 million due to additional borrowings.
final u.s. liquidity coverage ratio under the liquidity coverage rules, we will be required to calculate the modified lcr for key. at december 31, 2017, our estimated modified lcr was above 100%. in the future, we may change the composition of our investment portfolio, increase the size of the overall investment portfolio, and modify product offerings to enhance or optimize our liquidity position.
additional information about the liquidity coverage rules and modified lcr is included in the "supervision and regulation" section under the heading "regulatory capital requirements - liquidity requirements" in item 1 of this report.
74
long-term liquidity strategy our long-term liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by core deposits. however, we may use wholesale funds to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio, meet daily cash demands, and allow management flexibility to execute business initiatives. key's client-based relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base that, in conjunction with intermediate and long-term wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base, supports our liquidity risk management strategy. we use the loan-to-deposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies. our target loan-to-deposit ratio is 90-100% (at december 31, 2017, our loan-to-deposit ratio was 84.4%), which we calculate as total loans, loans held for sale, and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by deposits.
sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity include customer deposits, wholesale funding, and liquid assets. if the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances, we rely on wholesale funding or on-balance sheet liquid reserves. conversely, excess cash generated by operating, investing, and deposit-gathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets.
liquidity programs we have several liquidity programs, which are described in note 20 ("long-term debt"), that are designed to enable keycorp and keybank to raise funds in the public and private debt markets. the proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. these liquidity programs are reviewed from time to time by the board and are renewed and replaced as necessary. there are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs.
on june 9, 2017, keybank issued $600 million of 2.40% senior bank notes due june 9, 2022, under its global bank note program.
on september 14, 2017, keybank issued $750 million of 2.30% senior bank notes due september 14, 2022, under its global bank note program.
liquidity for keycorp the primary source of liquidity for keycorp is from subsidiary dividends, primarily from keybank. keycorp has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt; support customary corporate operations and activities (including acquisitions); support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries' obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, and without adverse consequences; and pay dividends to shareholders.
we use a parent cash coverage months metric as the primary measure to assess parent company liquidity. the parent cash coverage months metric measures the months into the future where projected obligations can be met with the current quantity of liquidity. we generally issue term debt to supplement dividends from keybank to manage our liquidity position at or above our targeted levels. the parent company generally maintains cash and short-term investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over at least the next 24 months. at december 31, 2017, keycorp held $2.3 billion in cash, which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations, including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our risk tolerance.
typically, keycorp meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from keybank, supplemented with term debt. federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval. a national bank's dividend-paying capacity is affected by several factors, including net profits (as defined by statute) for the two previous calendar years and for the current year, up to the date of dividend declaration. during 2017, keybank paid $750 million in dividends to keycorp. at january 1, 2018, keybank had regulatory capacity to pay $925 million in dividends to keycorp without prior regulatory approval.
75
our liquidity position and recent activity over the past 12 months, our liquid asset portfolio, which includes overnight and short-term investments, as well as unencumbered, high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios, has increased as a result of an increase in unpledged securities offset by net customer loan and deposit flows. the liquid asset portfolio continues to exceed the amount that we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longer-term solution.
from time to time, keycorp or keybank may seek to retire, repurchase, or exchange outstanding debt, capital securities, preferred shares, or common shares through cash purchase, privately negotiated transactions or other means. additional information on repurchases of common shares by keycorp is included in part ii, item 5. market for the registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities of this report. such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity and capital requirements, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements, and other factors. the amounts involved may be material, individually or collectively.
we generate cash flows from operations and from investing and financing activities. we have approximately $174 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in international tax jurisdictions as of december 31, 2017. as we consider alternative long-term strategic and liquidity plans, opportunities to repatriate these amounts would result in approximately $2 million in taxes to be paid. we have included the appropriate amount as a deferred tax liability at december 31, 2017.
the consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the years ended december 31, 2017, and december 31, 2016.
credit risk management credit risk is the risk of loss to us arising from an obligor's inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. like other financial services institutions, we make loans, extend credit, purchase securities, add financial and payments products, and enter into financial derivative contracts, all of which have related credit risk.
credit policy, approval, and evaluation we manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program. the credit risk committee approves management credit policies and recommends for approval significant credit policies to the appropriate board or board committee. these policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit.
our credit risk management team and certain individuals within our lines of business, to whom credit risk management has delegated limited credit authority, are responsible for credit approval. individuals with assigned credit authority are authorized to grant exceptions to credit policies. it is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate, however, a corporate level tolerance has been established to keep exceptions at an acceptable level based upon portfolio and economic considerations.
our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans. these models, known as scorecards, forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant. the scorecards are embedded in the application processing system, which allows for real-time scoring and automated decisions for many of our products. we periodically validate the loan grading and scoring processes.
we maintain an active concentration management program to mitigate concentration risk in our credit portfolios. for individual obligors, we employ a sliding scale of exposure, known as hold limits, which is dictated by the type of loan and strength of the borrower. our legal lending limit is approximately $2.2 billion for any individual borrower. however, internal hold limits generally restrict the largest exposures to less than 20% of that amount. as of december 31, 2017, we had 14 client relationships with loan commitments net of credit default swaps of more than $200 million. the average amount outstanding on these 14 individual net obligor commitments was $82 million at december 31, 2017. in general, our philosophy is to maintain a diverse portfolio with regard to credit exposures.
we actively manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives and concentration risk tolerances to mitigate portfolio credit risk. we utilize credit default swaps on a limited basis to transfer a portion
76
of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a third party. at december 31, 2017, we used credit default swaps with a notional amount of $159 million to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations.
credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. related gains or losses, as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection, are included in the "corporate services income" and "other income" components of noninterest income.

allowance for loan and lease losses we estimate the appropriate level of the alll on at least a quarterly basis. the methodology used is described in note 1 ("summary of significant accounting policies") under the heading "allowance for loan and lease losses." briefly, our allowance applies incurred loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics. we exercise judgment to assess any adjustment to the incurred loss rates for the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions, lending policies including underwriting standards, and the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets. the alll at december 31, 2017, represents our best estimate of the probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date. for more information about impaired loans, see note 6 ("asset quality").
as shown in figure 35, our alll from continuing operations remained relatively stable, increasing by $19 million, or 2.2%, from december 31, 2016. our commercial alll increased by $19 million, or 2.7%, from december 31, 2016, primarily because of loan growth and credit quality moving toward normalized levels. our consumer alll was unchanged from december 31, 2016. the consumer alll was impacted by declining loan balances and improving credit quality.

net loan charge-offs figure 36 shows the trend in our net loan charge-offs by loan type, while the composition of loan charge-offs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in figure 37.
over the past 12 months, net loan charge-offs increased $3 million. this increase is attributable to the growth in our loan portfolio and higher charge-offs in our consumer loan portfolios partially offset by an increase in recoveries in our commercial and industrial loan portfolio driven by a large recovery during the third quarter of 2017. in 2018, we expect net loan charge-offs to average loans to remain below our long-term targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points.

nonperforming assets figure 38 shows the composition of our nonperforming assets. as shown in figure 38, nonperforming assets decreased $142 million during 2017. most of the decrease came from our commercial and industrial loan portfolio centered in oil and gas exposures. these improvements were slightly offset by increases in nonperforming designations in our consumer portfolio as a result of regulatory guidance. see note 1 ("summary of significant accounting policies") under the headings "nonperforming loans," "impaired loans," and "allowance for loan and lease losses" for a summary of our nonaccrual and charge-off policies.

operational and compliance risk management like all businesses, we are subject to operational risk, which is the risk of loss resulting from human error or malfeasance, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events. these events include, among other things, threats to our cybersecurity, as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities. operational risk also encompasses compliance risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules and regulations, prescribed practices, and ethical standards. under the dodd-frank act, large financial companies like key are subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation. this heightened level of regulation has increased our operational risk. resulting operational risk losses
81
and/or additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation, or foregone opportunities.
we seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk, alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance, and a system of internal controls and reporting. we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws, rules, and regulations. for example, an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses. this tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action. we also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes. this technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the board.
the operational risk management program provides the framework for the structure, governance, roles, and responsibilities, as well as the content, to manage operational risk for key. the compliance risk committee serves the same function in managing compliance risk for key. primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business. the operational risk committee and compliance risk committee are senior management committees that oversee our level of operational and compliance risk and direct and support our operational and compliance infrastructure and related activities. these committees and the operational risk management and compliance functions are an integral part of our erm program. our risk review function regularly assesses the overall effectiveness of our operational risk management and compliance programs and our system of internal controls. risk review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the risk and audit committees and independently supports the risk committee's oversight of these controls.
cybersecurity we maintain comprehensive cyber incident response plans, and we devote significant time and resources to maintaining and regularly updating our technology systems and processes to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks, and other technology assets against attempts by third parties to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems, or cause other damage. we and many other u.s. financial institutions have experienced distributed denial-of-service attacks from technologically sophisticated third parties. these attacks are intended to disrupt or disable online banking services and prevent banking transactions. we also periodically experience other attempts to breach the security of our systems and data. these cyberattacks have not, to date, resulted in any material disruption of our operations or material harm to our customers, and have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
cyberattack risks may also occur with our third-party technology service providers, and may result in financial loss or liability that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. cyberattacks could also interfere with third-party providers' ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us. recent high-profile cyberattacks have targeted retailers, credit bureaus, and other businesses for the purpose of acquiring the confidential information (including personal, financial, and credit card information) of customers, some of whom are customers of ours. we may incur expenses related to the investigation of such attacks or related to the protection of our customers from identity theft as a result of such attacks. we may also incur expenses to enhance our systems or processes in order to protect our customers whose information may have been exposed through the recent breach of the equifax credit bureau or other external security incidents. risks and exposures related to cyberattacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of internet banking, mobile banking, and other technology-based products and services by us and our clients.

fourth quarter results figure 41 shows our financial performance for each of the past eight quarters. highlights of our results for the fourth quarter of 2017 are summarized below.
earnings our fourth quarter net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders was $181 million, or $.17 per common share, compared to $213 million, or $.20 per common share, for the fourth quarter of 2016.
on an annualized basis, our return on average total assets from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was .57%, compared to .69% for the fourth quarter of 2016. the annualized return on average tangible common equity from continuing operations was 6.35% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 7.88% for the year-ago quarter.
net interest income te net interest income was $952 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, and the net interest margin was 3.09%, compared to te net interest income of $948 million and a net interest margin of 3.12% for the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting the benefit from higher interest rates and low deposit betas. the improvement in our te net interest income was partially offset by a decline of $54 million of purchase account accretion related to the acquisition of first niagara compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 and a shift in funding mix into certificates of deposit.
noninterest income our noninterest income was $656 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $618 million for the year-ago quarter. growth was largely driven by another record quarter of investment banking and debt placement fees, up $43 million from the year-ago period, related to the recent acquisition of cain brothers, as well as ongoing growth in our core franchise, including strength in commercial mortgage banking. momentum continued in many fee-based businesses, as cards and payments income and trust and investment services income each grew $8 million from the year-ago period, as a result of higher credit card and merchant fees and strength in the equity markets, respectively. these increases were partially offset by a decline in other income, including $7 million of impairments of certain tax-advantaged assets, which were offset by a reduction of related income tax expense.
noninterest expense our noninterest expense was $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016, and included a number of notable items, including merger-related charges and the estimated impact of tax reform and related actions. merger-related charges included $26 million of personnel expense and $30 million of non-personnel expense, mostly reflected in net occupancy, marketing and other expense. the fourth quarter of 2017 was the last quarter that merger charges related to the first niagara acquisition will be reported. the estimated impact of tax reform and other related actions totaled $29 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, including the impairment of certain tax-advantaged assets, as well as a one-time additional contribution to employee retirement accounts.
excluding notable items, noninterest expense was unchanged from the year-ago period. expenses related to acquisitions and investments, including cain brothers, as well as higher operating lease expense were offset by the realization of first niagara cost savings.
provision for credit losses our provision for credit losses was $49 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $66 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. our alll was $877 million, or 1.01% of total period-end loans, at december 31, 2017, compared to 1.00% at december 31, 2016.
net loan charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $52 million, or .24% of average total loans. these results compare to $72 million, or .34%, for the fourth quarter of 2016.
83
income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of $251 million, compared to a tax provision of $38 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 56.2%, compared to 14.1% for the same quarter one year ago, due to lower pretax income resulting from merger-related charges, increased energy tax credits associated with leasing activities, a reduction of valuation allowances related to capital loss carryforwards, and the tcj act. our income tax provision increased $147 million, or 33%, compared to the same quarter one year ago due to the reduction to our net deferred tax asset and related actions associated with the tcj act. accordingly, our tax provision from continuing operations, excluding the impacts of the tcj act, was $104 million and our effective tax rate was 23.2% for the quarter. refer to note 14 ("income taxes"), for more information on the impact of the tcj act.

critical accounting policies and estimates our business is dynamic and complex. consequently, we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies. these choices are critical; not only are they necessary to comply with gaap, they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance. all accounting policies are important, and all policies described in note 1 ("summary of significant accounting policies") should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance.
in our opinion, some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility. these policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance, or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances, they may prove to be inaccurate, or we may find it necessary to change them. the following is a description of our current critical accounting policies.
allowance for loan and lease losses the alll is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio. in determining the alll, we apply expected loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions, underwriting standards, concentrations of credit, collateral values, and the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows. for all commercial and consumer tdrs, regardless of size, as well as all other impaired commercial loans with outstanding balances of $2.5 million or greater, we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss and assign a specific allowance to the loan.
86
our loss estimates include an assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality that may not be fully reflective in the historical loss, risk-rating, or other indicative data. the alll is sensitive to a variety of internal factors, such as modifications in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding, portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings. the alll is also sensitive to a variety of external factors, such as the general health of the economy, as evidenced by volatility in commodity prices, changes in real estate demand and values, interest rates, unemployment rates, bankruptcy filings, fluctuations in the gdp, and the effects of weather and natural disasters such as droughts, floods and hurricanes. management considers these variables and all other available information when establishing the final level of the alll. these variables and others may result in actual loan losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts.
since our loss rates are applied to large pools of loans, even minor changes in the level of estimated losses can significantly affect management's determination of the appropriate alll because those changes must be applied across a large portfolio. to illustrate, an increase in estimated losses equal to one-tenth of one percent of our consumer loan portfolio as of december 31, 2017, would indicate the need for a $24 million increase in the alll. the same increase in estimated losses for the commercial loan portfolio would result in a $63 million increase in the alll. such adjustments to the alll can materially affect financial results. following the above examples, a $24 million increase in the consumer loan portfolio allowance would have reduced our earnings on an after-tax basis by approximately $15 million, or $.01 per common share; a $63 million increase in the commercial loan portfolio allowance would have reduced earnings on an after-tax basis by approximately $39 million, or $.04 per common share.
our accounting policy related to the alll is disclosed in note 1 under the heading "allowance for loan and lease losses."
fair value measurements we measure or monitor many of our assets and liabilities on a fair value basis. fair value is generally defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability (an entry price), in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. while management uses judgment when determining the price at which willing market participants would transact when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to "normal" market activity, management's objective is to determine the point within the range of fair value estimates that is most representative of a sale to a third-party investor under current market conditions. the value to us if the asset or liability were held to maturity is not included in the fair value estimates.
a fair value measure should reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including the assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance. fair value is measured based on a variety of inputs that we utilize. fair value may be based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets (level 1 valuations). if market prices are not available, quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market are used (level 2 valuations). where observable market data is not available, the valuation is generated from model based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market, but observable based on our specific data (level 3 valuations). these unobservable assumptions reflect our own estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. valuation techniques typically include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques, but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability.
the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a fair value higher or lower than carrying value. considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value.
for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, our policy is to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements for those items where there is an active market. in certain cases, when market observable inputs for model-based valuation techniques may not be readily available, we are required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument. the models used to determine fair value adjustments are
87
regularly evaluated by management for relevance under current facts and circumstances.
changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. for example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. when market data is not available, we use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value.
fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary measure of accounting. fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to measure certain assets or liabilities (including htm securities, commercial loans held for sale, and oreo) for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with current accounting guidance.
impairment analysis also relates to long-lived assets, goodwill, and core deposit and other intangible assets. an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value. in determining the fair value, management uses models and applies the techniques and assumptions previously discussed.
see note 1 under the heading "fair value measurements," and in note 7 ("fair value measurements") for a detailed discussion of determining fair value, including pricing validation processes.
goodwill the valuation and testing methodologies used in our analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in note 1 under the heading "goodwill and other intangible assets." accounting guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether additional goodwill impairment testing is required. we did not choose to utilize this qualitative assessment in our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2017. therefore, the first step in goodwill impairment testing is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. our reporting units for purposes of the analysis are our two major business segments: key community bank and key corporate bank.
the amount of capital being allocated to our reporting units as a proxy for the carrying value is based on risk-based regulatory capital requirements. fair values are estimated using an equal combination of market and income approaches. the market approach incorporates comparable public company multiples along with data related to recent merger and acquisition activity. the income approach consists of discounted cash flow modeling that utilizes internal forecasts and various other inputs and assumptions. a multi-year internal forecast is prepared for each reporting unit and a terminal growth rate is estimated for each one based on market expectations of inflation and economic conditions in the financial services industry. earnings projections for both reporting units are adjusted for after tax cost savings expected to be realized by a market participant. the discount rate applied to our cash flows is derived from the capital asset pricing model ("capm"). the buildup to the discount rate includes a risk-free rate, 5-year adjusted beta based on peer companies, a market equity risk premium, a size premium and a company specific risk premium. the discount rates differ between our two reporting segments as they have different levels of risk. key corporate bank generally has a higher discount rate due to a higher level of perceived risk related to its service offerings and asset mix. a sensitivity analysis is typically performed on key assumptions, such as the discount rates and cost savings estimates.
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill impairment may be indicated. in such a case, we would perform the second step of goodwill impairment testing, and we would estimate a hypothetical purchase price for the reporting unit (representing the unit's fair value). then we would compare that hypothetical purchase price with the fair value of the unit's net assets (excluding goodwill). any excess of the estimated purchase price over the fair value of the reporting unit's net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, the impairment loss represented by this difference is charged to earnings. we continue to monitor the impairment indicators for goodwill and other intangible assets, and to evaluate the carrying amount of these assets quarterly. additional information is provided in note 12 ("goodwill and other intangible assets").
88
derivatives and hedging we primarily use interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk for asset and liability management purposes. these derivative instruments modify the interest rate characteristics of specified on-balance sheet assets and liabilities. our accounting policies related to derivatives reflect the current accounting guidance, which provides that all derivatives should be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value, after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements. accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a particular derivative depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship, and further, on the type of hedging relationship.
the application of hedge accounting requires significant judgment to interpret the relevant accounting guidance, as well as to assess hedge effectiveness, identify similar hedged item groupings, and measure changes in the fair value of the hedged items. we believe our methods of addressing these judgments and applying the accounting guidance are consistent with both the guidance and industry practices. on january 1, 2018, we will early adopt revised derivative and hedging accounting guidance. for additional information on the adoption of this guidance, refer to the table in note 1 under the heading "accounting guidance pending adoption on december 31, 2017". additional information relating to our use of derivatives is included in note 1 under the heading "derivatives," and note 9 ("derivatives and hedging activities").
contingent liabilities, guarantees and income taxes note 22 ("commitments, contingent liabilities, and guarantees") summarizes contingent liabilities arising from litigation and contingent liabilities arising from guarantees in various agreements with third parties under which we are a guarantor, and the potential effects of these items on the results of our operations. we record a liability for the fair value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of a guarantee, but there is a risk that our actual future payments in the event of a default by the guaranteed party could exceed the recorded amount. see note 22 ("commitments, contingent liabilities, and guarantees") for a comparison of the liability recorded and the maximum potential undiscounted future payments for the various types of guarantees that we had outstanding at december 31, 2017.
it is not always clear how the internal revenue code and various state tax laws apply to transactions that we undertake. in the normal course of business, we may record tax benefits and then have those benefits contested by the irs or state tax authorities. we have provided tax reserves that we believe are adequate to absorb potential adjustments that such challenges may necessitate. however, if our judgment later proves to be inaccurate, the tax reserves may need to be adjusted, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and capital.
additionally, we conduct quarterly assessments that determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are more-likely-than-not to be realized, and therefore recorded. the available evidence used in connection with these assessments includes taxable income in prior periods, projected future taxable income, potential tax-planning strategies, and projected future reversals of deferred tax items. these assessments are subjective and may change. based on these criteria, and in particular our projections for future taxable income, we currently believe it is more-likely-than-not that we will realize our net deferred tax asset in future periods. however, if our assessments prove incorrect, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which they occur. for further information on our accounting for income taxes, see note 1 ("summary of significant accounting policies") and note 14 ("income taxes").
during 2017, we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates.

(a)   represents our outstanding leases.
(b)   represents contracts to hedge our balance sheet asset and liability needs, and to accommodate our clients' trading and/or hedging needs. our derivative mark-to-market exposures are calculated and reported on a daily basis. these exposures are largely covered by cash or highly marketable securities collateral with daily collateral calls.
(c)   other europe consists of austria, belgium, finland, and sweden.
our credit risk exposure is largely concentrated in developed countries with emerging market exposure essentially limited to commercial facilities; these exposures are actively monitored by management. we do not have at-risk exposures in the rest of the world.

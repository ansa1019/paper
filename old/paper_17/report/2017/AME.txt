item 1a. risk factors you should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k and the documents we incorporate by reference in this annual report on form 10-k. any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
a downturn in the economy generally or in the markets we serve could adversely affect our business.
a number of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control. a downturn in the u.s. or global economy, and, in particular, in the aerospace and defense, oil and gas, process instrumentation or power markets could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality.
our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve and visibility into our markets is limited (particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution). our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial statements. certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. in addition, in certain of our businesses, demand depends on customers capital spending budgets, as well as government funding policies, and matters of public policy and government budget dynamics, as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities. demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns, which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in incentive programs, new product introductions and customer inventory levels. any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period.
our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions. we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions.
a portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses. since the beginning of 2013, through december 31, 2017, we have completed 18 acquisitions. we plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. although we have been successful with our acquisition strategy in the past, our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors, including:
   our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates;

               the impact of increased competition for acquisitions, which may increase acquisition costs and affect our ability to consummate acquisitions on favorable terms and may result in us assuming a greater portion of the sellers liabilities;

         successfully integrating acquired businesses, including integrating the financial, technological and management processes, procedures and controls of the acquired businesses with those of our existing operations;

   adequate financing for acquisitions being available on terms acceptable to us;

11
   u.s. and foreign competition laws and regulations affecting our ability to make certain acquisitions;

   unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of acquired businesses;

   mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities; and

   challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations.

the process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. furthermore, even if successfully integrated, the acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned. failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities.
certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. in most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements.
we may not properly execute, or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits from, our operational excellence initiatives.
our success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings or other benefits from our ongoing production and procurement initiatives. these initiatives are primarily designed to make the company more efficient, which is necessary in the companys highly competitive industries. these initiatives are often complex, and a failure to implement them properly may, in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits, adversely affect our business and operations.
foreign and domestic economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our international sales and operations.
international sales for 2017 and 2016 represented 51.5% and 52.4% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. as a result of our growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the united states will increase in the future. approximately half of our international sales are of products manufactured outside the united states. as of december 31, 2017, we have manufacturing operations in 17 countries outside the united states, with significant operations in china, the czech republic, mexico and serbia. a prolonged disruption of our ability to obtain a supply of goods from these countries or a change in the effective cost of these products could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operations. international sales and operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment, including:
   imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions, including in the united states;

   overlap of different tax structures;

   unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, including in the united states;

12
   trade protection measures, such as the imposition of or increase in tariffs and other trade barriers, including in the united states;

   the difficulty and/or costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverse regions and employee bases;

   restrictions on currency repatriation;

   general economic conditions;

   unstable political situations;

   nationalization of assets; and

   compliance with a wide variety of international and u.s. laws and regulatory requirements.

furthermore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries where we operate, subject us to exchange rate exposure and may adversely affect our financial statements. for example, increased strength in the u.s. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold overseas, which may adversely affect sales or require us to lower our prices. in addition, our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, and we must translate our assets, liabilities, sales and expenses into u.s. dollars for external reporting purposes. as a result, changes in the value of the u.s. dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their local currency.
our international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws.
we are required to comply with various import, export, export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. in certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies and in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item. in addition, failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation.
our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.
we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate u.s. and/or non-u.s. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. in particular, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the u.s. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to
13
incur significant legal and investigatory fees. in addition, we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
any inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully.
if we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses, manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business. even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees, the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations.
if we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our business and prospects.
we believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop, on a timely basis, technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards. although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors, maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing. there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses. we are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete, although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products.
our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage.
many of our products rely on proprietary technology; therefore, we endeavor to protect our intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions. despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. in addition, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the u.s. actions to enforce our rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful.
a shortage of, or price increases for, our raw materials could increase our operating costs.
while we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products, we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers. the availability and prices for raw materials, parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers allocation to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. in addition, certain items, including base metals and certain steel components, are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations. shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance clean-up which may adversely affect our financial condition.
our businesses, operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, air
14
emissions, discharges to waters and the use, manufacturing, generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations. certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating, removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property, regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous materials. in addition, the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act generally imposes joint and several liability for clean-up costs, without regard to fault, on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for clean-up under the act. we have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites, which are the subject of government-mandated clean-ups. as the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use, manufacture, store, handle and dispose of various hazardous materials, we may incur substantial costs for investigation, removal, remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws. while it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters, based on our experience to date, we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations. in addition, new laws and regulations, new classification of hazardous materials, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. there can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities.
we are subject to numerous governmental regulations, which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs.
our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws and regulations. in addition, existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations, including with respect to climate change, may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products. we cannot predict the form any such new laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations.
we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements.
we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously owned entities), including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition-related matters, as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement. these lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages and/or injunctive relief. the defense of these lawsuits may divert our managements attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements. moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. in addition, developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period. we cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation. however, based on our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not believe that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of the date of this information statement will have a material effect on our financial statements.
15
we operate in highly competitive industries, which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business.
our markets are highly competitive. we compete, domestically and internationally, with individual producers, as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers, some of which have resources greater than we do. the principal elements of competition for our products are product technology, quality, service, distribution and price. although we believe eig is a market leader, competition is strong and could intensify in the markets served by eig. in the aerospace markets served by eig, a limited number of companies compete on the basis of product quality, performance and innovation. emgs competition in specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and processes. our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologies or changing requirements of our customers. there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors.
restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness.
our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements (each a debt facility and collectively, debt facilities) contain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness. these restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions, limit our ability to pay dividends, limit our ability to make capital expenditures or restrict our financial flexibility. our debt facilities contain covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our debt facilities may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. a breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in a debt facility could result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt facilities. upon the occurrence of an event of default under a debt facility, and the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under one or more of our other debt facilities, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. if this were to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness.
our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by cybersecurity incidents, and other information technology and business disruptions.
our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems, products and information technology systems may be impacted by natural or man-made disruptions, including cybersecurity attacks, other information technology attacks or failures, threats to physical security, armed conflict, as well as damaging weather or other acts of nature, pandemics or other public health crises. for example, our information technology systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, cyberattacks or other security breach, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunications or utility failures, or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our disaster recovery planning and security upgrade efforts may be ineffective or inadequate. a shutdown of, or inability to utilize, one or more of our facilities, our supply chain, our distribution system, our products or our information technology, telecommunications or other systems, could significantly disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, our relationships and reputation with customers, suppliers, employees, stockholders and others, result in lost sales, result in the misappropriation or corruption of data, or result in legal exposure and large remediation or other expenses.
16
our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial proportion of our total assets and the impairment of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets, primarily goodwill. at december 31, 2017, goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $5,129.0 million or 66% of our total assets. the goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired. at a minimum, we assess annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets. if future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below current levels, we could record, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating income for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment. any determination requiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

this report includes forward-looking statements based on the companys current assumptions, expectations and projections about future events. when used in this report, the words believes, anticipates, may, expect, intend, estimate, project and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such words. in this report, the company discloses important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from managements expectations. for more information on these and other factors, see forward-looking information herein.
the following managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item 1a. risk factors, item 6. selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
business overview ameteks operations are affected by global, regional and industry economic factors. however, the companys strategic geographic and industry diversification, and its mix of products and services, have helped to mitigate the potential adverse impact of any unfavorable developments in any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. in 2017, the company established records for orders, sales, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. the strengthening global economic environment compared to 2016, contributions from recent acquisitions, and continued focus on and implementation of operational excellence initiatives, had a positive impact on 2017 results. the company also benefited from its strategic initiatives under ameteks four key strategies: operational excellence, strategic acquisitions, global & market expansion and new products.
highlights of 2017 were:
                       orders for 2017 were $4,539.8 million, an increase of $691.0 million or 18.0%, compared with
$3,848.8 million in 2016. as a result, the companys backlog of unfilled orders at december 31, 2017 was a record $1,396.1 million.

                                                                     net sales for 2017 were $4,300.2 million, an increase of $460.1 million or 12.0%, compared with
$3,840.1 million in 2016. the increase in net sales for 2017 was due to 6% organic sales growth, with 5% organic sales growth in the electronic instruments group (eig) and 8% organic sales growth in the electromechanical group
(emg), and a 6% increase from the 2017 and 2016 acquisitions.

   net income for 2017 was $681.5 million, an increase of $169.3 million or 33.1%, compared with
$512.2 million in 2016.

   diluted earnings per share for 2017 were $2.94, an increase of $0.75 or 34.2%, compared with $2.19 per diluted share in 2016.

   cash flow provided by operating activities for 2017 was $833.3 million, an increase of $76.5 million or 10.1%, compared with $756.8 million in 2016.

   during 2017, the company spent $556.6 million in cash, net of cash acquired, to acquire three businesses:

                    in february 2017, acquired rauland-borg corporation (rauland), a global provider of enterprise clinical and education communications solutions for hospitals, healthcare systems and educational facilities;

24
                         in june 2017, acquired mocon, inc., a provider of laboratory and field gas analysis instrumentation to research laboratories, production facilities and quality control departments in food and beverage, pharmaceutical and industrial applications; and

   in december 2017, acquired arizona instrument llc, a provider of differentiated, high-precision moisture and gas measurement instruments in food, pharmaceutical and environmental markets.

                                                                              on december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted the tax cuts and jobs act (the act). as a result, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the company recorded a net benefit of $91.6 million in the consolidated statement of income as a component of provision for income taxes. the act had the effect of increasing 2017 diluted earnings per share by $0.39.
see below for further discussion.

                                                  during 2017, the company recorded pre-tax realignment costs totaling
$16.8 million. the realignment costs had the effect of reducing net income for 2017 by $13.0 million ($0.05 per diluted share). see below for further discussion.

   in the fourth quarter of 2017, the company paid in full, at maturity, $270 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.20% private placement senior notes.

                                      the company continued its emphasis on investment in research, development and engineering, spending
$221.2 million in 2017 before customer reimbursement of $5.4 million. sales from products introduced in the past three years were $1,042.9 million or 24.3% of net sales.

results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared with the year ended december 31, 2016
in 2017, the company established records for orders, sales, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. the continued strengthening global economic environment, contributions from the acquisitions completed in 2017 and the acquisitions of laserage technology corporation (laserage) in october 2016, hs foils and nu instruments in july 2016, and brookfield engineering laboratories (brookfield) and esp/surgex in january 2016, and continued focus on and implementation of operational excellence initiatives, including the 2017 and 2016 realignment actions (described further throughout the results of operations for the fourth quarter and year ended december 31, 2017), are expected to have a positive impact on the companys 2018 results.

the expected annualized cash savings from the 2017 realignment costs is expected to be approximately $5 million and is expected to be fully realized in 2019.
segment operating income for 2017 was $988.4 million, an increase of $132.8 million or 15.5%, compared with segment operating income of $855.6 million in 2016. the increase in segment operating income for 2017 resulted primarily from the increase in net sales noted above. segment operating income, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 23.0% in 2017, compared with 22.3% in 2016. the increase in segment operating margins for 2017 resulted primarily from the net impact of the 2017 versus the 2016 realignment costs and 2016 impairment charge noted above. segment operating income and segment operating margins for 2017 and 2016 included the impact of the realignment costs and 2016 impairment charge detailed in the tables above.
cost of sales for 2017 was $2,851.4 million or 66.3% of net sales, an increase of $276.2 million or 10.7%, compared with $2,575.2 million or 67.1% of net sales for 2016. the cost of sales increase for 2017 was affected by the net sales increase noted above. cost of sales for 2017 and 2016 included the impact of the realignment costs and 2016 impairment charge detailed in the tables above.
selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses for 2017 were $533.6 million or 12.4% of net sales, an increase of $70.6 million or 15.2%, compared with $463.0 million or 12.1% of net sales in 2016. the increase in sg&a expenses for 2017 was primarily due to the increase in net sales noted above, a fourth quarter of 2017 $5.0 million charitable donation and a second quarter of 2017 $2.5 million equity-based compensation charge related to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock grants in association with the retirement of the companys executive chairman of the board of directors. for 2016, sg&a expenses included $1.6 million of realignment costs noted above.
consolidated operating income was $915.1 million or 21.3% of net sales for 2017, an increase of $113.2 million or 14.1%, compared with $801.9 million or 20.9% of net sales in 2016.
interest expense was $98.0 million for 2017, an increase of $3.7 million or 3.9%, compared with $94.3 million in 2016. the interest expense increase for 2017 was primarily due to the impact of private placement senior notes funded in the fourth quarter of 2016, partially offset by lower average borrowings under the companys revolving credit facility period over period.
other expenses, net were $20.3 million for 2017, an increase of $5.8 million, compared with $14.5 million in 2016. the other expenses, net increase for 2017 was primarily due to higher environmental-related expenses.

the effective tax rate for 2017 was 14.5%, compared with 26.1% in 2016. on december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted the tax cuts and jobs act (the act). the act, which is also commonly referred to as u.s. tax reform, significantly changes u.s. corporate income tax laws by, among other things, reducing the u.s. corporate income tax rate to 21% starting in 2018 and creating a territorial tax system with a one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings of u.s. subsidiaries. as a result, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the company recorded a net benefit of $91.6 million in the consolidated statement of income as a component of provision for income taxes. the $91.6 million net benefit consisted of a $185.8 million benefit resulting from the remeasurement of the companys net deferred tax liabilities in the u.s. based on the new lower corporate income tax rate and a $94.2 million expense relating to the one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred earnings of certain non-u.s. subsidiaries that are owned either wholly or partially by a u.s. subsidiary of the company. also, included in the $94.2 million, the company recorded additional deferred tax liabilities of $13.3 million related to state income and foreign withholding taxes expected to be incurred when the cash amounts related to the mandatory tax are ultimately repatriated to the u.s., offset by $1.0 million for a remeasurement of uncertain tax positions impacted by the mandatory tax inclusion.
although the $91.6 million net benefit represents what the company believes is a reasonable estimate of the impact of the income tax effects of the act on the companys consolidated financial statements as of december 31, 2017, it should be considered provisional. as additional guidance from the u.s. department of treasury is provided, the company may need to adjust the provisional amounts after it finalizes the 2017 u.s. tax return and is able to conclude whether any further adjustments are required to its u.s. portion of net deferred tax liability of $390.4 million as of december 31, 2017, as well as to the liability associated with the one-time mandatory tax. the currently recorded amounts include a variety of estimates of taxable earnings and profits, estimated taxable foreign cash balances, differences between u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) and u.s. tax principles and interpretations of many aspects of the act that may, if changed, impact the final amounts. any adjustments to these provisional amounts will be reported as a component of provision for income taxes in the reporting period in which any such adjustments are determined, which will be no later than the fourth quarter of 2018, and could result in significant impacts to the effective tax rate for the period. the company is still evaluating the potential future impact of the global intangible low-taxed income (gilti) section of the act and has not provided any provisional deferred tax liability for it. under u.s. gaap, the company is permitted to make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on future inclusions in the u.s. taxable income related to gilti as a current period expense when incurred or to factor such amounts into the companys measurement of its deferred taxes. due to the ongoing evaluation, the company has not yet made the accounting policy decision. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further details.
the 2017 effective tax rate reflects $12.3 million of tax benefits related to share-based payment transactions in accordance with the january 1, 2017 adoption of the financial accounting standards board (fasb) accounting standards update (asu) no. 2016-09, improvements to employee share-based payment accounting (asu 2016-09). see notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further details.
the effective tax rates for 2017 and 2016 reflect the impact of foreign earnings, which are taxed at lower rates, tax benefits related to international and state tax planning initiatives and the release of uncertain tax position liabilities relating to certain statute expirations.

results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared with the year ended december 31, 2015
in 2016, the company was impacted by a weak global economy and the effects of a continued strong u.s. dollar. specifically, the company experienced lower sales in its process businesses that have exposure to oil and gas markets and in its engineered materials, interconnects and packaging businesses that have exposure to metals markets. contributions from the acquisitions completed in 2016 and the acquisitions of surface vision in july 2015 and global tubes in may 2015, as well as the companys operational excellence initiatives had a positive impact on 2016 results.
net sales for 2016 were $3,840.1 million, a decrease of $134.2 million or 3.4%, compared with net sales of $3,974.3 million in 2015. eig net sales were $2,360.3 million in 2016, a decrease of 2.4%, compared with $2,417.2 million in 2015. emg net sales were $1,479.8 million in 2016, a decrease of 5.0%, compared with $1,557.1 million in 2015. the decrease in net sales for 2016 was due to a 7% organic sales decline and an unfavorable 1% effect of foreign currency translation, partially offset by a 4% increase from acquisitions.
total international sales for 2016 were $2,010.7 million or 52.4% of net sales, a decrease of $44.0 million or 2.1%, compared with international sales of $2,054.7 million or 51.7% of net sales in 2015. the $44.0 million decrease in international sales was primarily driven by a weak global economy, as well as the foreign currency translation headwind noted above. both reportable segments of the company maintain strong international sales presences in europe and asia. export shipments from the united states, which are included in total international sales, were $1,036.0 million in 2016, a decrease of $54.7 million or 5.0%, compared with $1,090.7 million in 2015. export shipments decreased primarily due to a weak global economy, as well as the competitive impacts of a strong u.s. dollar.
orders for 2016 were $3,848.8 million, a decrease of $75.9 million or 1.9%, compared with $3,924.7 million in 2015. the decrease in orders for 2016 was due to a 5% organic order decline resulting from a weak global economy noted above, partially offset by a 3% increase from acquisitions. as a result, the companys backlog of unfilled orders at december 31, 2016 was $1,156.5 million, an increase of $8.7 million or 0.8%, compared with $1,147.8 million at december 31, 2015.
the company recorded $25.6 million of 2016 realignment costs in the fourth quarter of 2016. the 2016 realignment costs primarily related to $19.3 million in severance costs for a reduction in workforce and $6.2 million of asset write-downs in response to the impact of a weak global economy on certain of the companys businesses, as well as the effects of a continued strong u.s. dollar. the company recorded 2015 realignment costs totaling $36.6 million, with $15.9 million recorded in the first quarter of 2015 and $20.7 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 (the 2015 realignment costs). the 2015 realignment costs primarily related to reductions in workforce in response to the impact of a weak global economy on certain of the companys businesses, as well as the effects of a continued strong u.s. dollar. see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further details.

(5)   the leases expire over a range of years from 2018 to 2082 with renewal or purchase options, subject to various terms and conditions, contained in most of the leases.

(6)   purchase obligations primarily consist of contractual commitments to purchase certain inventories at fixed prices.

other commitments the company has standby letters of credit and surety bonds of $47.3 million related to performance and payment guarantees at december 31, 2017. based on experience with these arrangements, the company believes that any obligations that may arise will not be material to its financial position.
critical accounting policies the company has identified its critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the companys financial condition and results of operations and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based on the companys historical experience and managements judgment. because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ materially from the estimates used. the consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to the companys accounting policies and to managements discussion and analysis. the information that follows represents additional specific disclosures about the companys accounting policies regarding risks, estimates, subjective decisions or assessments whereby materially different financial condition and results of operations could have been reported had different assumptions been used or different conditions existed. primary disclosure of the companys significant accounting policies is in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.

                                                                                          revenue recognition. the company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period when the sales process is complete. this generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, under which title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable. for a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, the company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. the companys policy with respect to sales returns and allowances generally provides that the customer may not return products or be given allowances, except at the companys option. the company has agreements with distributors that do not provide expanded rights of return for unsold products. the distributor purchases the product from the company, at which time title and risk of loss transfers to the distributor. the company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits to its distributors other than volume discounts. the company accounts for these sales incentives as a reduction of revenues when the sale is recognized in the consolidated statement of income. accruals for sales returns, other allowances and estimated warranty costs are provided at the time revenue is recognized based on the companys historical experience. at december 31, 2017 and 2016, the accrual for future warranty obligations was $22.9 million and $22.0 million, respectively. the companys expense for warranty obligations was $16.0 million in both 2017 and 2016, and $14.8 million in 2015, respectively. the warranty periods for products sold vary among the companys operations, but generally do not exceed one year. the company calculates its warranty expense provision based on its historical warranty experience and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses. if actual future sales returns and allowances and warranty amounts are higher than the companys historical experience, additional accruals may be required.

                                                                                        accounts receivable. the company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of specific customers to meet their financial obligations to the company. a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against the amount due from these customers. for all other customers, the company recognizes allowance for doubtful accounts based on the length of time specific receivables are past due based on its historical experience. if the financial condition of the companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. the allowance for doubtful accounts was $10.4 million and $10.3 million at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

                                                                                                          inventories. the company uses the first-in, first-out (fifo) method of accounting, which approximates current replacement cost, for approximately 84% of its inventories at december 31,
2017. the last-in, first-out (lifo) method of accounting is used to determine cost for the remaining 16% of the companys inventory at december 31,
2017. for inventories where cost is determined by the lifo method, the fifo value would have been $22.9 million and $18.4 million higher than the lifo value reported in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the company provides estimated inventory reserves for slow-moving and obsolete inventory based on current assessments about future demand, market conditions, customers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and related management initiatives. if these factors are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory reserves may be required.

                                                                                       business combinations. the company allocates the purchase price of an acquired company, including when applicable, the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values, with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. third party appraisal firms and other consultants are engaged to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. estimating fair values requires significant judgments, estimates and assumptions, including but not limited to: discount rates, future cash flows and the economic lives of trade names, technology, customer relationships, property, plant and equipment, as well as income taxes. these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies, and are inherently uncertain.

                                                                                       goodwill and other intangible assets. goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily trademarks and trade names, are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually. for the purpose of the goodwill impairment test, the company can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units. the company elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen and performed the first step quantitative analysis of the goodwill impairment test in the current year. the company may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods. the first step in the quantitative process is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. if the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is recognized. an impairment charge would be recognized to the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the reporting unit fair value.

the company identifies its reporting units at the component level, which is one level below its operating segments. generally, goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides. the companys reporting units are divisions that are one level below its operating segments and for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management.
the company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit, which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate. the company believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sale transaction. the annual goodwill impairment test requires the company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins, depreciation, amortization and working capital requirements, which are based on the companys long-range plan and are considered level 3 inputs. the companys long-range plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management. the discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt, including a risk premium. while the company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances. while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions, the companys overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged. in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the goodwill impairment test to changes in the fair value calculations, the company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease in fair values of each reporting unit. the 2017 results (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) showed that, despite the hypothetical 10% decrease in fair value, the fair values of the companys reporting units still exceeded their respective carrying values by 20% to 670% for each of the companys reporting units.
the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. the company can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those assets. the company elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen. the company may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods. the company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty method using level 3 inputs. the company believes the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets. the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use.
the companys acquisitions have generally included a significant goodwill component and the company expects to continue to make acquisitions. at december 31, 2017, goodwill and other indefinite-lived
40
intangible assets totaled $3,724.6 million or 47.7% of the companys total assets. the company completed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2017 and determined that the carrying values of the companys goodwill were not impaired.
other intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. the carrying value of other intangible assets with finite lives is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from those assets are separately identifiable and are less than the carrying value. in that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of those assets. fair value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group.
                                                                                            pensions. the company has u.s. and foreign defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. the most significant elements in determining the companys pension income or expense are the assumed pension liability discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. the pension discount rate reflects the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be settled at the valuation date. at the end of each year, the company determines the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities. in estimating this rate for 2017, the company considered rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income investments that have maturities consistent with the anticipated funding requirements of the plan. the discount rate used in determining the 2017 pension cost was 7.50% for u.s. defined benefit pension plans and 6.79% for foreign plans. the discount rate used for determining the funded status of the plans at december 31, 2017 and determining the 2018 defined benefit pension cost was 7.50% for u.s. plans and 6.79% for foreign plans. in estimating the u.s. and foreign discount rates, the companys actuaries developed a customized discount rate appropriate to the plans projected benefit cash flow based on yields derived from a database of long-term bonds at consistent maturity dates. the company used an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2017 of 7.50% for u.s. defined benefit pension plans and 6.79% for foreign plans. in 2018, the company will use 7.50% for the u.s. plans and 6.64% for the foreign plans. the company determines the expected long-term rate of return based primarily on its expectation of future returns for the pension plans investments. additionally, the company considers historical returns on comparable fixed-income and equity investments, and adjusts its estimate as deemed appropriate. the rate of compensation increase used in determining the 2017 pension income for the u.s. plans was 3.75% and was 2.50% for the foreign plans. the u.s. and foreign plans rate of compensation increase will remain unchanged in 2018. in both 2017 and 2016, the company recognized consolidated pre-tax pension income of $4.3 million from its u.s. and foreign defined benefit pension plans. the company estimates its 2018 u.s. and foreign defined benefit pension pre-tax income to be approximately $15 million.

all unrecognized prior service costs, remaining transition obligations or assets and actuarial gains and losses have been recognized, net of tax effects, as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity and will be amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost. the company uses a measurement date of december 31 (its fiscal year end) for its u.s. and foreign defined benefit plans.
to fund the plans, the company made cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2017, which totaled $54.8 million, compared with $6.8 million in 2016. the company anticipates making approximately $2 million to $6 million in cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2018.
                                                                                       income taxes. the process of providing for income taxes and determining the related balance sheet accounts requires management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. the company conducts a broad range of operations around the world and is therefore subject to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. management must make judgments currently about such uncertainties and determine estimates of the companys tax assets and liabilities. to

41
the extent the final outcome differs, future adjustments to the companys tax assets and liabilities may be necessary.

the company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets, taking into consideration the companys forecast of future taxable income, available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. based on this assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and the amount of, valuation allowances against the companys deferred tax assets. to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required.
the company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions, by applying a minimum recognition threshold which a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. once the minimum threshold is met, using a more likely than not standard, a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit. the tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50% likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination. the underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes, published guidance, external expert opinion, or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past. there can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy, legislation and audit practice. the company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.
recent accounting pronouncements in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (asu 2014-09) and modified the standard thereafter. the objective of asu 2014-09 is to establish a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition guidance. the core principle of asu 2014-09 is that an entity recognizes revenue at the transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. asu 2014-09 applies to all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of other topics in the fasb accounting standards codification.
asu 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017 and may be early adopted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016. the company adopted asu 2014-09 as of january 1, 2018. the guidance permits adoption by retrospectively applying the guidance to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method) or prospectively applying the guidance and providing additional disclosures comparing results to previous guidance, with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized in beginning retained earnings at the date of initial application (modified retrospective method). the company will use the modified retrospective method of adoption.
asu 2014-09 will impact the companys revenue recognition procedures by requiring recognition of certain revenues to move from upon shipment or delivery to over-time. the recording of certain revenues over-time is not expected to have a material impact on the companys consolidated results of operations or financial position. also, the company has developed the additional expanded disclosures required. the company has implemented the appropriate changes to its business processes to support recognition and disclosure under asu 2014-09. the company does not expect the adoption of asu 2014-09 to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
in july 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-11, simplifying the measurement of inventory (asu 2015-11), which applies to inventory that is measured using fifo or average cost. as prescribed in this update, an entity should measure inventory that is within scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value, which is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of
42
completion, disposal and transportation. subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory that is measured using lifo. the company prospectively adopted asu 2015-11 effective january 1, 2017 and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
in november 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-17, balance sheet classification of deferred taxes (asu 2015-17). asu 2015-17 simplifies the presentation of deferred taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheet. the company prospectively adopted asu 2015-17 effective january 1, 2017. therefore, prior periods have not been adjusted to reflect this adoption. the adoption of asu 2015-17 did not have a significant impact on the companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
in february 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-02, leases (asu 2016-02). the new standard establishes a right-of-use model that requires a lessee to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than twelve months. leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. asu 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. asu 2016-02 includes transitional guidance, as currently issued, that calls for a modified retrospective approach. the fasb has recently proposed adding a transition option to the current guidance and it includes optional practical expedients for ease of transition. the company has formed a steering committee to lead the companys implementation project. the company has not determined the impact asu 2016-02 may have on the companys consolidated results of operations, financial position, cash flows and financial statement disclosures, which could be significant to the companys financial position.
in march 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-09, improvements to employee share-based payment accounting. asu 2016-09 includes changes to the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. the company prospectively adopted asu 2016-09 effective january 1, 2017. for the year ended december 31, 2017, the company recorded a tax benefit of $12.3 million within provision for income taxes related to the tax effects of share-based payment transactions. prior to adoption, this amount would have been recorded as a component of capital in excess of par value. the adoption of this standard could create volatility in the companys effective tax rate going forward. the company elected not to change its accounting policy with respect to the estimation of forfeitures. the company no longer reclassifies the excess tax benefits from share-based payments from operating activities to financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. for the year ended december 31, 2017, the company excluded the excess tax benefits from the assumed proceeds available to repurchase shares in the computation of its diluted earnings per share and the related increase in the companys diluted weighted average common shares outstanding was not significant.
in january 2017, the fasb issued asu no. 2017-01, clarifying the definition of a business (asu 2017-01). asu 2017-01 provides a more robust framework to use in determining when a set of assets and activities is a business. asu 2017-01 requires an entity to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets; if so, the set of assets is not a business. asu 2017-01 requires that, to be a business, the set must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. asu 2017-01 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. asu 2017-01 will be applied prospectively to any transactions occurring within the period of adoption. early adoption is permitted, including for interim or annual periods in which the financial statements have not been issued or made available for issuance. the company does not expect the adoption of asu 2017-01 to have a significant impact on the companys consolidated results of operations, financial position, cash flows and financial statement disclosures.
in january 2017, the fasb issued asu no. 2017-04, simplifying the test for goodwill impairment (asu 2017-04). asu 2017-04 eliminates the requirement to calculate the reporting unit fair value of goodwill
43
(second step) to measure a goodwill impairment charge. under the guidance, an impairment charge will be measured based on the excess of the reporting units carrying amount over its fair value (first step). asu 2017-04 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. the company early adopted asu 2017-04 effective january 1, 2017 and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the companys consolidated results of operations, financial position, cash flows and financial statement disclosures.
in march 2017, the fasb issued asu no. 2017-07, improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost (asu 2017-07), which changes how employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and/or other postretirement benefit plans present the net periodic benefit cost in the income statement. asu 2017-07 requires employers to present the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in the same income statement line item as other employee compensation costs. all other components of the net periodic benefit cost will be presented outside of operating income. asu 2017-07 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. the changes in presentation will be applied retrospectively when adopted. the company expects restated 2017 cost of sales to increase $11.5 million with an offsetting $11.5 million increase to other operating income. the 2018 service cost included in operating income is expected to approximate 2017 service cost of $7.1 million. the company does not expect the adoption of asu 2017-07 to have a significant impact on the companys consolidated financial position, cash flows and financial statement disclosures.
in may 2017, the fasb issued asu no. 2017-09, scope of modification accounting (asu 2017-09). asu 2017-09 clarifies which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. asu 2017-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. the company does not expect the adoption of asu 2017-09 to have a significant impact on the companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
internal reinvestment capital expenditures capital expenditures were $75.1 million or 1.7% of net sales in 2017, compared with $63.3 million or 1.6% of net sales in 2016. in 2017, approximately 55% of capital expenditures were for improvements to existing equipment or additional equipment to increase productivity and expand capacity. capital expenditures in 2018 are expected to approximate 2% of net sales, with a continued emphasis on spending to improve productivity.
research, development and engineering the company is committed to, and has consistently invested in, research, development and engineering activities to design and develop new and improved products and solutions. research, development and engineering costs before customer reimbursement were $221.2 million in 2017 and $200.8 million in both 2016 and 2015. customer reimbursements in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $5.4 million, $7.2 million and $6.9 million, respectively. these amounts included research and development expenses of $130.4 million, $112.0 million and $116.3 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. all such expenditures were directed toward the development of new products and solutions and the improvement of existing products and solutions.
environmental matters certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as defined by federal and state laws and regulations. the company believes these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time. at december 31, 2017, the company is named a potentially responsible party (prp) at 13 non-ametek-owned former waste disposal or treatment sites (the non-owned sites). the company is identified as a de minimis party in 12 of these sites based on the low
44
volume of waste attributed to the company relative to the amounts attributed to other named prps. in eight of these sites, the company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements. the tentatively agreed-to settlement amounts are fully reserved. in the other four sites, the company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount. at the remaining site where the company is a non-de minimis prp, the company is participating in the investigation and/or related required remediation as part of a prp group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the companys expected obligations. the company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue. in addition to these non-owned sites, the company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations (the owned sites). for claims and proceedings against the company with respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established once the company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable. this estimate is refined as the company moves through the various stages of investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study and corrective action processes. in certain instances, the company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the best estimate. it is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements; however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements. in estimating the companys liability for remediation, the company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other prps to fulfill their obligations.
total environmental reserves at december 31, 2017 and 2016 were $30.1 million and $28.4 million, respectively, for both non-owned and owned sites. in 2017, the company recorded $7.7 million in reserves and the reserve increased $0.4 million due to foreign currency translation. additionally, the company spent $6.4 million on environmental matters in 2017. the companys reserves for environmental liabilities at december 31, 2017 and 2016 included reserves of $11.6 million and $12.4 million, respectively, for an owned site acquired in connection with the 2005 acquisition of hcc industries (hcc). the company is the designated performing party for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a superfund site in the san gabriel valley of california. the company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of hcc related to the costs of the required remedial activities. at december 31, 2017, the company had $12.0 million in receivables related to hcc for probable recoveries from third-party escrow funds and other committed third-party funds to support the required remediation. also, the company is indemnified by hccs former owners for approximately $19 million of additional costs.
the company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of previously owned businesses. under certain of the agreements, the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the company against, certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances. the company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters. to date, these parties have met their obligations in all material respects.
the company believes it has established reserves for the environmental matters described above, which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders. the company has no reason to believe that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future. in the opinion of management, based on presently available information and the companys historical experience related to such matters, an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the company.
the company has been remediating groundwater contamination for several contaminants, including trichloroethylene (tce), at a formerly owned site in el cajon, california. several lawsuits have been filed against the company alleging damages resulting from the groundwater contamination, including property damages and personal injury, and seeking compensatory and punitive damages. given the state of uncertainty inherent in these litigations, the company does not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably
45
possible loss in regard to these matters. the company believes that it has good and valid defenses to each of these claims and intends to defend them vigorously. the company does not expect the outcome of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to materially affect the consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the company.
market risk the companys primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which could impact its financial condition and results of operations. the company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. the companys differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating income as a whole.
the companys short-term debt carries variable interest rates and generally its long-term debt carries fixed rates. these financial instruments are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
the foreign currencies to which the company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the euro, the british pound, the japanese yen, the chinese renminbi, the canadian dollar, the mexican peso and the swiss franc. exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is modest, monitored, and when possible, mitigated through the use of local borrowings and occasional derivative financial instruments in the foreign currency affected. the effect of translating foreign subsidiaries balance sheets into u.s. dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity. foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies.
the primary commodities to which the company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel, aluminum, copper, steel, titanium and gold. exposure to price changes in these commodities are generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements, although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures.
based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates, commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates, the companys best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings, fair value of risk-sensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material, although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis.
forward-looking information certain matters discussed in this form 10-k are forward-looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 (pslra), which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the companys operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions, or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. many such factors will be important in determining the companys actual future results. the company wishes to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the pslra by cautioning readers that numerous important factors, in some cases have caused, and in the future could cause, the companys actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the company. some, but not all, of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under item 1a. risk factors. the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or otherwise, unless required by the securities laws to do so.

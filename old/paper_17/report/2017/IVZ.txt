item 1a.  risk factors volatility and disruption in world capital and credit markets, as well as adverse changes in the global economy, can negatively affect invesco's revenues, operations, financial condition and liquidity.
in recent years, capital and credit markets have experienced substantial volatility. in this regard:
•   in the event of extreme circumstances, including economic, political, or business crises, such as a widespread systemic failure or disruptions in the global financial system or failures of firms that have significant obligations as counterparties on financial instruments, we may suffer significant declines in aum and severe liquidity or valuation problems in managed investment products in which client and company assets are invested, all of which would adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, liquidity, credit ratings, ability to access capital markets, and ability to retain and attract key employees. additionally, these factors could impact our ability to realize the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets.
•   in addition to the impact of the market volatility on client portfolios, illiquidity and/or volatility of the global fixed income and/or equity markets could negatively affect our ability to manage client inflows and outflows or to timely meet client redemption requests.
•   in the u.s., regulations requiring a variable ("floating") net asset value (nav) for institutional prime and tax-free money market funds became effective in october 2016. those same regulations also provide for the potential imposition of the assessment of fees in connection with redemptions and/or gates that postpone the time in which redemptions must be processed in the event those funds' weekly liquid assets fall below certain specified thresholds. our government money market funds and retail prime and tax-free money market funds continue to offer a stable nav of $1.00 per share and are not required to impose fees and gates; however, we do not guarantee such nav level. market conditions could lead to severe liquidity issues in money market products, which could lead to the imposition of fees or gates with respect to institutional prime and tax-free money market funds and an affect on the navs of government and retail prime and tax-free money market funds. if our institutional prime or tax-free money market funds were to impose redemption fees or gates delaying the payment of redemption proceeds, or the nav of one of our government or retail prime or tax-free money market funds were to decline below $1.00 per share, such funds could experience significant redemptions in aum, loss of shareholder confidence and reputational harm.
•   more broadly, uncertainties regarding geopolitical developments can produce volatility in global financial markets. as an example, the u.k. electorate voted in june 2016 to exit the european union (brexit), which resulted in market volatility. although negotiations between the uk and eu regarding brexit began in june 2017, it is still uncertain what terms may be agreed to in the final outcome and for any transitional period and what impact those terms may have on global markets. this may impact the levels and composition of our aum and also negatively impact investor sentiment, which could result in reduced or negative flows. in addition, because the u.k. pound sterling is the functional currency for certain of our subsidiaries, any weakening of the u.k. pound sterling relative to the u.s. dollar could negatively impact our reported financial results.
we may not adjust our expenses quickly enough to match significant deterioration in global financial markets.
if we are unable to effect appropriate expense reductions in a timely manner in response to declines in our revenues, or if we are otherwise unable to adapt to rapid changes in the global marketplace, our profitability, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.
our revenues and profitability would be adversely affected by any reduction in aum as a result of either a decline in market value of such assets or net outflows, which would reduce the investment management fees we earn.
we derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts with clients. under these contracts, the investment management fees paid to us are typically based on the market value of aum. aum may decline for various reasons. for any period in which revenues decline, our income and operating margin likely would decline by a greater proportion because a majority of our expenses remain fixed. factors that could decrease aum (and therefore revenues) include the following:
declines in the market value of aum in client portfolios. these could be caused by price declines in the securities markets generally or by price declines in the market segments in which our aum are concentrated. approximately 46% of our total aum were invested in the equity asset class and approximately 54% were invested in the fixed income asset class and other asset classes at december 31, 2017. our aum as of january 31, 2018 were $972.6 billion. we cannot predict whether volatility in the markets will result in substantial or sustained declines in the securities markets generally or result in price declines in market segments in which our aum are concentrated. any of the foregoing could negatively impact our revenues, income and operating margin.
12
redemptions and other withdrawals from, or shifting among, client portfolios. these could be caused by investors (in response to adverse market conditions or pursuit of other investment opportunities) reducing their investments in client portfolios in general or in the market segments in which invesco focuses; investors taking profits from their investments; poor investment performance (relative or absolute) of the client portfolios managed by invesco; and portfolio risk characteristics, which could cause investors to move assets to other investment managers. poor performance relative to other investment management firms tends to result in decreased sales and increased redemptions with corresponding decreases in our revenues. failure of our client portfolios to perform well could, therefore, have a material adverse effect on us. furthermore, the fees we earn vary with the types of assets being managed, with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts, along with real estate and other alternative asset products, and lower fees earned on fixed income, stable return accounts, and certain etfs. our revenues may decline if clients continue to shift their investments to lower fee accounts. in addition, the loss of key personnel or significant investment management professionals could reduce the attractiveness of our products to current and potential clients and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.
investments in international markets. investment products that we manage may have significant investments in international markets that are subject to significant risks of loss from political, economic, diplomatic developments, currency fluctuations, social instability, changes in governmental policies, expropriation, nationalization and asset confiscation. international trading markets, particularly emerging markets and frontier markets, are often smaller, less liquid, less regulated and significantly more volatile than those in the developed world.
our investment advisory agreements are subject to termination or non-renewal, and our fund and other investors may withdraw their assets at any time.
substantially all of our revenues are derived from investment management agreements. investment management agreements are generally terminable upon 30 or fewer days' notice. agreements with u.s. registered funds may be terminated with notice, or terminated in the event of an "assignment" (as defined in the investment company act of 1940, as amended), and must be renewed annually by the disinterested members of each fund's board of trustees or directors, as required by law. in addition, the boards of trustees or directors of certain other fund accounts generally may terminate these investment management agreements upon written notice for any reason. open-end registered fund and unit trust investors may generally withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice. institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationships with us or reduce the aggregate amount of aum, generally on short notice. any termination of or failure to renew a significant number of these agreements, or any other loss of a significant number of our clients or aum, would adversely affect our revenues and profitability.
our revenues and profitability from money market and other fixed income assets may be harmed by interest rate, liquidity and credit volatility.
certain institutional investors using money market products and other short-term duration fixed income products for cash management purposes may shift these investments to direct investments in comparable instruments in order to realize higher yields than those available in money market and other fund products holding lower yielding instruments. these redemptions would reduce managed assets, thereby reducing our revenues. in addition, rising interest rates will tend to reduce the market value of fixed income investments and fixed income derivatives held in various investment portfolios and other products. thus, increases in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our revenues from money market portfolios and from other fixed income products. if securities within a money market portfolio default or investor redemptions force the portfolio to realize losses, there could be negative pressure on its nav. although money market investments are not guaranteed instruments, the company might decide, under such a scenario, that it is in its best interest to provide support in the form of a support agreement, capital infusion, or other methods to help stabilize a declining nav. some of these methods could have an adverse impact on our profitability. additionally, we have investments in fixed income assets, including collateralized loan obligations and seed money in fixed income funds, the valuation of which could change with changes in interest and default rates.
performance fees may increase revenue and earnings volatility.
a portion of the company's revenues is derived from performance fees on investment advisory assignments. performance fees represented $113.3 million, or 2.2%, of total operating revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017. in most cases, performance fees are based on relative or absolute investment returns, although in some cases they are based on achieving specific service standards. generally, the company is entitled to performance fees only if the returns on the related portfolios exceed agreed-upon periodic or cumulative return targets. if these targets are not exceeded, performance fees for that period will not be earned and, if targets are based on cumulative returns, the company may not earn performance fees in future periods. performance fees will vary from period to period in relation to volatility in investment returns and the timing of revenue recognition, causing our earnings to be more volatile.
13
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. we, and the client portfolios that we manage, have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, clearing organizations, hedge funds and other institutions. many of these transactions expose us or such client portfolios to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty. while we regularly conduct assessments of such risk posed by counterparties, the risk of non-performance by such parties is subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets.
our financial condition and liquidity would be adversely affected by losses on our seed capital and co-investments.
the company has investments in managed investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including, but not limited to equities, fixed income products, commodities, derivatives, and similar financial instruments, private equity and real estate. investments in these products are generally made to establish a track record, meet purchase size requirements for trading blocks, or demonstrate economic alignment with other investors in our funds. adverse market conditions may result in the need to write down the value of these seed capital and co-investments. a reduction in the value of these investments may adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity. as of december 31, 2017, the company had $891.7 million in seed capital and co-investments, including direct investments in consolidated investment products (cip).
we operate in an industry that is highly regulated in many countries, and any enforcement action or adverse changes in the laws or regulations governing our business could decrease our revenues and profitability.
as with all investment management companies, our activities are highly regulated in almost all countries in which we conduct business. laws and regulations applied at the national, state or provincial and local level generally grant governmental agencies and industry self-regulatory authorities broad administrative discretion over our activities, including the power to limit or restrict our business activities, conduct examinations, risk assessments, investigations and capital adequacy reviews, and impose remedial programs to address perceived deficiencies. as a result of regulatory oversight, we could face requirements which negatively impact the way in which we conduct business, increase compliance costs and/or impose additional capital requirements. our regulators likewise have the authority to commence enforcement actions which could lead to sanctions up to and including the revocation of licenses to operate certain businesses, the suspension or expulsion from a particular jurisdiction or market of any of our business organizations or their key personnel or the imposition of fines and censures on us or our employees. judgments or findings of wrongdoing by regulatory or governmental authorities, or in private litigation against us, could affect our reputation, increase our costs of doing business and/or negatively impact our revenues. any of the effects discussed above could have a material negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
a substantial portion of the products and services we offer are regulated by the securities and exchange commission (sec), financial industry regulatory authority (finra), the commodities future trading commission (cftc), the national futures association (nfa) and the texas department of banking in the united states and by the financial conduct authority (fca) and the prudential regulatory authority (pra) in the united kingdom. subsidiaries operating in the european union (eu) are subject to various eu directives, which generally are implemented by member state national legislation and by eu regulations. our operations elsewhere in the world are regulated by similar regulatory organizations.
the regulatory environment in which we operate frequently changes and has seen a significant increase in regulation in recent years. various changes in laws and regulations have been enacted or otherwise implemented in multiple jurisdictions globally in response to the crisis in the financial markets that began in 2007. various other proposals remain under consideration by legislators, regulators, other government officials and other public policy commentators. certain enacted provisions and certain other proposals are potentially far reaching and, depending upon their implementation, could have a material impact on our business. while certain of these provisions appear to address perceived problems in the banking sector, some will or may be applied more broadly and affect other financial services companies, including investment managers. while invesco does not believe that the these post-crisis developments have or will fundamentally change the investment management industry or cause invesco to reconsider its basic strategy, certain provisions have required, and other provisions will or may require, us to change or impose new limitations on the manner in which we conduct business; they also have increased regulatory burdens and related compliance costs, and will or may continue to do so. more broadly, we may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations. to the extent that existing regulations are interpreted or amended or future regulations are adopted in a manner that reduces the sale, or increases the redemptions, of our products and services, or that negatively affects the investment performance of our products or impacts our product mix, our aggregate aum and our revenues could be adversely affected. in addition, regulatory changes have imposed and may continue to impose additional costs or capital requirements, which could negatively impact our profitability or return on equity.

in december 2014, then sec chair mary jo white announced a comprehensive agenda for regulatory change governing the u.s. asset management industry and directed sec staff to develop a five-part series of new regulations addressing the topics of enhanced portfolio reporting, liquidity risk management, leverage and use of derivatives, adviser wind up and stress testing for funds and advisers.  rules proposed in 2015 for the first two of these initiatives became final in october 2016. the sec has also proposed a rule that would impose restrictions on the use of derivatives by registered funds. these new industry rules would or could be expected to add additional reporting and compliance costs and may affect the development of new products and the ability to continue to offer certain strategies through a registered investment company format. in late 2017 the sec announced an updated regulatory agenda which deferred, de-prioritized or removed certain of these items. the practical impact of such changes remains uncertain as of the date of this report.
the eu has promulgated or is considering various new or revised directives pertaining to financial services, including investment managers. such directives are progressing at various stages, and generally have been, are being or will or would be implemented by national legislation in member states. ongoing changes in the eu's regulatory framework applicable to our business, including changes related to brexit and any other changes in the composition of the eu's member states, may add further complexity to our global risks and operations.
developments under regulatory changes will or may include, without limitation:
•   expanded regulation over investment management firms.
•   new or increased capital requirements and related regulation.
•   change to the regulation of money market funds in the eu requiring capital buffers.
•   limitations on holdings of certain commodities under proposed regulations of the cftc which could result in capacity constraints for our products that employ commodities as part of their investment strategy.
•   the u.s. department of labor adopted regulations in april 2016 that treat as fiduciaries any person who provides investment advice or recommendations to employee benefit plans, plan fiduciaries, plan participants, plan beneficiaries, individual retirement accounts (iras) or ira owners. the regulations have wide-ranging consequences for invesco and our u.s. distribution partners and product line. under the new rules, firms and individuals who recommend financial products to retirement investors are be required to act in the best interest of the investor and, to receive variable compensation, would be required to enter into a contract with clients and produce complex disclosure documents intended to highlight financial conflicts of interest that may arise from the compensation the financial adviser receives from firms like invesco. these rules went into partial effect in june 2017, but the implementation of the enforcement mechanism has been delayed until july 2019. the sec is reviewing whether it might promulgate its own version of a fiduciary rule, possibly in conjunction with a re-proposed version of these dol rules. rules promulgated by the sec in this area could have wider impact than such dol rules.
•   other changes to the distribution of investment funds and other investment products. in the u.s., the sec previously has proposed and may repropose significant changes to rule 12b-1, and may propose other regulatory changes impacting distribution of investment funds. invesco believes these proposals could increase operational and compliance costs. the eu has implemented the alternative investment fund manager directive (aifmd); implementing legislation in member states has, among other elements, imposed restrictions on the marketing and sale within the eu of private equity and other alternative investment funds sponsored by non-eu managers. various regulators promulgated or are considering other new disclosure or suitability requirements pertaining to the distribution of investment funds and other investment products, including enhanced standards and requirements pertaining to disclosures made to retail investors at the point of sale.
•   in 2015, the fca undertook a study of the asset management industry and released their final report in june 2017. the report highlighted a number of specific industry issues and proposed a number of remedies that will take place in a number of stages, including: changes to governance, changes to fee structures to provide clients with increased transparency, improved disclosure in client documentation, improved ability for retail clients to change share classes and changes to pension pooling and investment consultant regulations in the institutional segment.
•   the markets in financial instruments directive ii (mifid ii) in the eu, effective in january 2018, seeks to promote a single market for wholesale and retail transactions in financial instruments. mifid ii addresses the conduct of business rules for intermediaries providing investment services and the effective, efficient and safe operation of financial markets. key elements of mifid ii are the extent to which retrocessions may be paid and the use of trading commissions to fund research. the company has announced that, beginning in january 2018, external research costs incurred for mifid ii impacting funds and client accounts in europe have been absorbed by the company. we do not expect these costs to be material to the company's financial statements. while the foregoing provisions only impact the eu, client-driven competitive pressures may cause an expansion of these principles to other business regions in which we operate.
•   an increased focus on liquidity in funds (including fixed income funds), an example of which is the sec's rules with respect to liquidity and liquidity risk management applicable to certain types of registered u.s. funds that are scheduled to take effect in 2018.
15
•   increased requirements to provide regulators and investors more granular detail regarding our products and services, including the sec's reporting modernization rule applicable to certain types of registered u.s. funds that are scheduled to take effect in 2018.
•   regulations pertaining to the privacy of data with respect to clients, employees and business partners. in particular, effective may 25, 2018, the eu's general data protection regulation (gdpr) will strengthen data protection rules for individuals within the eu and the export of data outside of the eu. compliance with gdpr will require an extensive review of our global data processing systems. a failure to comply with gdpr could result in fines up to 20 million euros or 4% of our annual revenues, whichever is higher.
•   increased regulatory scrutiny on operations of private equity funds.
•   requirements pertaining to the trading of securities and other financial instruments, such as swaps and other derivatives, including certain provisions of the dodd-frank act and european market infrastructure regulation; these include significant reporting requirements, designated trading venues, mandated central clearing arrangements, restrictions on proprietary trading by certain financial institutions, other conduct requirements and potentially new taxes or similar fees.
•   heightened regulatory examinations and inspections, including enforcement reviews, and a more aggressive posture regarding commencing enforcement proceedings resulting in fines, penalties and additional remedial activities to firms and to individuals. without limiting the generality of the foregoing, regulators in the united states and the united kingdom have taken and can be expected to continue to take a more aggressive posture on bringing enforcement proceedings.
•   enhanced licensing and qualification requirements for key personnel.
•   guidelines regarding the structure and components of fund manager compensation and other additional rules and regulations and disclosure requirements. certain provisions impose additional disclosure burdens on public companies. certain proposals could impose requirements for more widespread disclosures of compensation to highly-paid individuals. depending upon the scope of any such requirements, invesco could be disadvantaged in retaining key employees vis-à-vis private companies, including hedge fund sponsors.
•   strengthening standards regarding various ethical matters, including compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act and anti-money-laundering laws and regulations.
•   regulations promulgated to address perceptions that the asset management industry, or certain of its entities or activities, pose systematic risks to the financial system.
•   regulations promulgated to protect personal data and address risks of fraud, malfeasance or other adverse consequences stemming from cyber attacks.
•   other changes impacting the identity or the organizational structure of regulators with supervisory authority over invesco.
we cannot at this time predict the full impact of potential legal and regulatory changes or possible enforcement proceedings on our business. such changes have imposed, and may continue to impose, new compliance costs and/or capital requirements or impact invesco in other ways that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. moreover, certain legal or regulatory changes could require us to modify our strategies, businesses or operations, and we may incur other new constraints or costs, including the investment of significant management time and resources in order to satisfy new regulatory requirements or to compete in a changed business environment. in recent years, certain regulatory developments have also added downward pressures regarding fee levels.
to the extent that existing or future regulations affecting the sale of our products and services or our investment strategies cause or contribute to reduced sales or increased redemptions of our products, impair the investment performance of our products or impact our product mix, our aum and results of operations might be adversely affected.
distribution of earnings of our subsidiaries may be subject to limitations, including net capital requirements.
substantially all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. as a result, our cash flow and our ability to fund operations are dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of earnings, intercompany loans or other payments by our subsidiaries to us. any payments to us by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions and are contingent upon our subsidiaries' earnings and business considerations. for example, certain of our subsidiaries are required under applicable laws and regulations to maintain appropriate levels of capital. such requirements may change from time-to-time as additional guidance is released based on a variety of factors, including balance sheet composition, assessment of risk exposures and governance and review from regulators. these and other similar provisions of applicable laws and regulations may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital, repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities. all of our regulated eu subsidiaries are subject to consolidated capital requirements under eu directives, including those arising from the eu's capital requirements directive and the u.k.'s internal capital adequacy assessment process (icaap), and capital is maintained within this sub-group to satisfy these regulations. we meet these requirements in part by holding cash and cash
16
equivalents. this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european sub-group in the countries where it is located. due to the capital restrictions, the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited. in addition, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences. as of december 31, 2017, the company's minimum regulatory capital requirement was $761.4 million. complying with our regulatory commitments may result in an increase in the capital requirements applicable to the european sub-group. as a result of corporate restructuring and regulatory requirements, certain of these eu subsidiaries may be required to limit their dividends to the ultimate parent company, invesco ltd. our financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected if certain of our subsidiaries are unable to distribute funds to us.
civil litigation and governmental investigations and enforcement actions could adversely affect our aum and future financial results, and increase our costs of doing business.
invesco and certain related entities have in recent years been subject to various legal proceedings, including civil litigation and governmental investigations and enforcement actions. these actions can arise from normal business operations and/or matters that have been the subject of previous regulatory reviews. further, as a global company with investment products registered in numerous countries and subject to the jurisdiction of one or more regulators in each country, at any given time, our business operations may be subject to review, investigation or disciplinary action. for example, in the united states, united kingdom and other jurisdictions in which the company operates, governmental authorities regularly make inquiries, hold investigations and administer market conduct examinations with respect to the company's compliance with applicable laws and regulations. lawsuits or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of these inquiries may in the future be filed against the company and related entities and individuals in the united states, united kingdom and other jurisdictions in which the company and its affiliates operate. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, note 18 -- "commitments and contingencies," for additional information. judgments in civil litigation or findings of wrongdoing by regulatory or governmental authorities against us could affect our reputation, increase our costs of doing business and/or negatively impact our revenues, any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
we are exposed to a number of risks arising from our international operations.
we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states. we have offices in numerous countries and sponsor many cross border and local proprietary funds that are domiciled outside the united states and may face difficulties in managing, operating and marketing our international operations. our international operations expose us to the political and economic consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions and subject us to expropriation risks, expatriation controls and potential adverse tax consequences.
terrorist activity and the continued threat of terrorism, as well as increased geopolitical unrest could adversely affect the global economy or specific international, regional and domestic markets, which may cause our aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
terrorist activity and the continued threat of terrorism and acts of civil or international hostility, both within the united states and abroad, as well as ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats, may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets, loss of life, property damage, disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. continued geopolitical unrest and terrorist activity that adversely affect the global economy, capital markets or specific international, regional or domestic markets may cause our aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
our investment management professionals and other key employees are a vital part of our ability to attract and retain clients, and the loss of key individuals or a significant portion of those professionals could result in a reduction of our revenues and profitability.
retaining highly skilled technical and management personnel is important to our ability to attract and retain our clients. the market for investment management professionals is competitive and has become more so in periods of growth of the investment management industry. the market for investment professionals and other key personnel is at times characterized by the movement of these professionals among different firms. our policy has been to provide our investment management professionals and other key personnel with a supportive professional working environment and compensation and benefits (including equity and other forms of deferred compensation) that we believe are competitive with other leading investment management firms. however, we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel, and the loss of significant investment professionals or other key personnel could reduce the attractiveness of our products to potential and current clients and could, therefore, adversely affect our revenues and profitability.
17
if our reputation is harmed, we could suffer losses in our business, revenues and net income.
our business depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of clients, regulators and other market participants, and our good reputation is critical to our business. our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or impossible to remediate. regulatory inquiries, investigations or findings of wrongdoing, intentional or unintentional misrepresentation of our products and services in advertising materials, public relations information, social media or other external communications, operational failures (including cyber breaches), employee dishonesty or other misconduct and rumors, among other things, can substantially damage our reputation, even if they are baseless or eventually satisfactorily addressed.
our business also requires us continuously to manage actual and potential conflicts of interest, including situations where our services to a particular client conflict, or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of other clients or those of invesco. the willingness of clients to enter into transactions in which such a conflict might arise may be affected if we fail - or appear to fail - to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest. in addition, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions.
we have procedures and controls that are designed to address and manage these risks, but this task can be complex and difficult, and if our procedures and controls fail, our reputation could be damaged. any damage to our reputation could impede our ability to attract and retain clients and key personnel, and lead to a reduction in the amount of our aum, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
failure to establish adequate controls and risk management policies, the circumvention of controls and policies or fraud could have an adverse effect on our reputation and financial position.
we have established a comprehensive risk management process and continue to enhance various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risks to our business; however, we cannot be assured that such controls, procedures, policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks to our business. we are subject to the risk that our employees, contractors or other third parties may deliberately seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud (including through cyber breaches) or act in ways that are inconsistent with our controls, policies and procedures. persistent or repeated attempts involving conflicts of interests, circumvention of policies and controls or fraud could have a materially adverse impact on our reputation and could lead to costly regulatory inquiries.
failure to comply with client contractual requirements and/or investment guidelines could result in damage awards against us and loss of revenues due to client terminations.
many of the investment management agreements under which we manage assets or provide products or services specify investment guidelines or requirements that we are required to observe in the provision of our services. laws and regulations impose similar requirements for certain client portfolios (such as registered funds). a failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could result in damage to our reputation or in our clients seeking to recover losses, withdrawing their assets or terminating their contracts. regulators likewise may commence enforcement actions for violations of such requirements. any such effects could cause our revenues and profitability to decline. we maintain various compliance procedures and other controls to prevent, detect and correct such errors. when an error is detected, a payment will typically be made into the applicable client account to correct it. significant errors for which we are responsible could impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
the failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may have a negative impact on similar invesco products irrespective of our performance.
many competitors offer similar products to those offered by us and the failure or negative performance of competitors' products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar invesco products, irrespective of the performance of such products. any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
18
competitive pressures may force us to reduce the fees we charge to clients, increase commissions paid to our financial intermediaries or provide more support to those intermediaries or could limit or reduce sales of our products, all of which could reduce our profitability.
the investment management business is highly competitive, and we compete based on a variety of factors, including investment performance, the range of products offered, brand recognition, business reputation, financial strength, stability and continuity of client and financial intermediary relationships, quality of service, level of fees charged for services and the level of compensation paid and distribution support offered to financial intermediaries. we continue to face market pressures regarding fee levels in certain products. investors remain attracted to lower fee passive products, which have gained and may continue to gain share at the expense of active products.
we face strong competition in every market in which we operate. our competitors include a large number of investment management firms, commercial banks, investment banks, broker-dealers, hedge funds, insurance companies and other financial institutions. some of these institutions have greater capital and other resources, and offer more comprehensive lines of products and services, than we do. our competitors seek to expand their market share in many of the products and services we offer. if these competitors are successful, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected. in addition, there are relatively few barriers to entry by new investment management firms, and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various distribution channels around the world have also resulted in increased competition.
in recent years there have been several instances of industry consolidation, both in the area of distributors and manufacturers of investment products. further consolidation may occur in these areas in the future. the increasing size and market influence of certain distributors of our products and of certain direct competitors may have a negative impact on our ability to compete at the same levels of profitability in the future, should we find ourselves unable to maintain relevance in the markets in which we compete.
we may engage in strategic transactions that could create risks.
we regularly review, and from time-to-time have discussions with and engage in, potential strategic transactions, including potential acquisitions, dispositions, consolidations, joint ventures or similar transactions, some of which may be material. there can be no assurance that we will find suitable candidates for strategic transactions at acceptable prices, have sufficient capital resources to pursue such transactions, be successful in negotiating the required agreements, or successfully close transactions after signing such agreements.
acquisitions also pose the risk that any business we acquire may lose customers or employees or could underperform relative to expectations. we could also experience financial or other setbacks if pending transactions encounter unanticipated problems, including problems related to closing or integration. following the completion of an acquisition, we may have to rely on the seller to provide administrative and other support, including financial reporting and internal controls, to the acquired business for a period of time. there can be no assurance that such sellers will do so in a manner that is acceptable to us.
we may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose us to additional costs or operational risk.
our financial performance depends, in part, on the company's ability to develop, market and manage new investment products and services. the development and introduction of new products and services requires continued innovative efforts on our part and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment. substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures, shifting client and market preferences, the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements. new products often must be in the market place for three or more years in order to generate track records required to attract significant aum inflows. a failure to continue to innovate to introduce successful new products and services or to manage effectively the risks associated with such products and services may impact our market share relevance and may cause our aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
19
our ability to maintain our credit ratings and to access the capital markets in a timely manner should we seek to do so depends on a number of factors.
our access to the capital markets depends significantly on our credit ratings. we have received credit ratings of a2/stable, a/negative and a-/stable from moody's investor services ("moody's"), standard & poor's ratings service ("s&p"), and fitch ratings ("fitch"), respectively, as of the date hereof. we believe that rating agency concerns include but are not limited to the fact that our revenues are exposed to equity market volatility and the potential impact from regulatory changes to the industry. additionally, the rating agencies could decide to downgrade the entire investment management industry, based on their perspective of future growth and solvency. material deterioration of these factors, and others defined by each rating agency, could result in downgrades to our credit ratings, thereby limiting our ability to generate additional financing. management believes that solid investment grade ratings are an important factor in winning and maintaining institutional business and strives to manage the company to maintain such ratings.
our credit facility borrowing rates are tied to our credit ratings. a reduction in our long-term credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs, could limit our access to the capital markets and may result in outflows thereby reducing aum and revenues. volatility in global finance markets may also affect our ability to access the capital markets should we seek to do so. if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner, our business could be adversely affected.
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations.
as of december 31, 2017, we had outstanding total debt of $2,075.8 million, excluding debt of cip, and total equity attributable to invesco ltd. of $8,696.1 million. the amount of indebtedness we carry could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or other purposes, increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or industry and place us at a disadvantage in relation to our competitors. any or all of the above factors could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations. the company expects approximately 80% of the $1.2 billion purchase price for the upcoming guggenheim investments' etf acquisition will be funded through the use of the company's existing credit facility, increasing our outstanding debt in 2018. the company plans to repay the amount borrowed over the course of 2018.
our credit facility imposes restrictions on our ability to conduct business and, if amounts borrowed under it were subject to accelerated repayment, we might not have sufficient assets or liquidity to repay such amounts in full.
our credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios, including maximum debt-to-earnings and minimum interest coverage ratios. the credit facility also contains customary affirmative operating covenants and negative covenants that, among other things, restrict certain of our subsidiaries' ability to incur debt and restrict our ability to transfer assets, merge, make loans and other investments and create liens. the breach of any covenant (either due to our actions or due to a significant and prolonged market-driven decline in our operating results) would result in a default under the credit facility. in the event of any such default, lenders that are party to the credit facility could refuse to make further extensions of credit to us and require all amounts borrowed under the credit facility, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. if any indebtedness under the credit facility were subject to accelerated repayment repayment and if we had at that time a significant amount of outstanding debt under the credit facility, we might not have sufficient liquid assets to repay such indebtedness in full.
20
changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our net revenues and hinder our growth.
we sell substantially all of our retail investment products through a variety of third party financial intermediaries, including major wire houses, fund supermarkets, regional broker-dealers, insurance companies, banks and financial planners in north america, and independent brokers and financial advisors, banks and supermarket platforms in europe and asia. no single one of these intermediaries is material to our business. increasing competition for these distribution channels could nevertheless cause our distribution costs to rise, which would lower our net revenues. following the financial crisis, there has been consolidation of banks and broker-dealers, particularly in the u.s., and a limited amount of migration of brokers and financial advisors away from major banks to independent firms focused largely on providing advice. if these changes continue, our distribution costs could increase as a percentage of our revenues generated. additionally, particularly outside of the u.s., certain of the third party intermediaries upon whom we rely to distribute our investment products also sell their own competing proprietary funds and investment products, which could limit the distribution of our products. investors, particularly in the institutional market, rely on external consultants and other third parties for advice on the choice of investment manager. these consultants and third parties tend to exert a significant degree of influence over their clients' choices, and they may favor a competitor of invesco as better meeting their particular clients' needs. there is no assurance that our investment products will be among their recommended choices in the future. similarly, particularly in the united states, certain distributors have substantially reduced the number of investment funds they make available to their customers. if a material portion of our distributors were to cease operations or substantially narrow their product offerings, it could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. any failure to maintain strong business relationships with these distribution sources and the consultant community would impair our ability to sell our products, which in turn could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability.
our business is vulnerable to deficiencies and failures in support systems and customer service functions that could lead to breaches and errors or reputational harm, resulting in loss of customers or claims against us or our subsidiaries.
in addition to investment management, our services include fund administration, sales, distribution, marketing, shareholder servicing and trust, custody and other fiduciary services. in order to be competitive and comply with our agreements, we must properly perform our fund and portfolio administration and related responsibilities, including portfolio recordkeeping and accounting, security pricing, corporate actions, investment restrictions compliance, daily net asset value computations, account reconciliations and required distributions to fund shareholders. the ability to consistently and reliably obtain accurate securities pricing information, process client portfolio and fund shareholder transactions and provide reports and other customer service to fund shareholders and clients in accounts managed by us is essential to our continuing success. certain types of securities may experience liquidity constraints that would require increased use of fair value pricing, which is dependent on certain subjective judgments that have the potential to be challenged. any delays or inaccuracies in obtaining pricing information, processing such transactions or such reports or other breaches and errors and any inadequacies in other customer service, could result in reimbursement obligations or other liabilities, or alienate customers and potentially give rise to claims against us. our customer service capability, as well as our ability to obtain prompt and accurate securities pricing information and to process transactions and reports, is highly dependent on communications and information systems and on third-party service providers. certain of these processes involve a degree of manual input, and thus problems could occur from time-to-time due to human error. our failure to properly perform and monitor our operations or our otherwise suffering deficiencies and failures in these systems or service functions could result in material financial loss or costs, regulatory actions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal claims and liability, which in turn could have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability.
the failure of one of our third party service providers or other key vendors to fulfill its obligations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or business, which may cause our aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
we depend on third party service providers and other key vendors for various fund administration, accounting, custody, risk analytics, market data, market indices and transfer agent roles, and other distribution and operational needs. if our third party service providers or other key vendors fail to fulfill their obligations to us, it could lead to operational and regulatory problems, including with respect to certain of our products, which could result in losses, enforcement actions, or reputational harm and may cause our aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
we depend on information technology, and any failures of or damage to, attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology systems or facilities, or those of third parties with which we do business, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could result in significant limits on our ability to conduct our operations and activities, costs and reputational damage.
we are highly dependent upon the use of various proprietary and third-party information and security technology, software applications and other technology systems to operate our business. we are also dependent on the effectiveness of our information and cyber security infrastructure, policies, procedures and capabilities to protect our computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them. we use our technology to, among other things, manage and trade
21
portfolio investments, support our other operations, obtain securities pricing information, process client transactions, protect the privacy of clients', employees' and business partners' data and provide reports and other customer services to the clients of the funds we manage. any inaccuracies, delays, systems failures or security breaches in these and other processes could disrupt our business operations, subject us to client, employee or business partner dissatisfaction and losses and/or subject us to reputational harm.
our computer, communications, data processing, networks, backup, business continuity or other operating, information or technology systems and facilities, including those that we outsource to other providers, may fail to operate properly or become disabled, overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control.
in recent years, several financial services firms suffered successful cyber-attacks launched both domestically and from abroad, resulting in the disruption of services to clients, loss or misappropriation of confidential data and reputational harm. our status as a global financial institution and the nature of our client base may enhance the risk that we are targeted by such cyber-threats. although we take protective measures, including measures to effectively secure information through system security technology, and continually monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption, our technology systems may still be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses or other events that have a security impact, such as an external hacker attack by one or more cyber criminals or an authorized employee or vendor causing us to release confidential information inadvertently or through malfeasance, or lose temporarily or permanently data or applications or systems, which could materially harm our operations and reputation. the third parties with which we do business or which facilitate our business activities, including financial intermediaries and technology infrastructure and service providers, are also susceptible to the foregoing risks (including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely), and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be adversely affected, perhaps materially, by failures, terminations, errors or malfeasance by, or attacks or constraints on, one or more financial, technology or infrastructure institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business.
breach of our technology systems could damage our reputation and could result in the unauthorized disclosure or modification or loss of sensitive or confidential information (including client data); unauthorized disclosure modification or loss of proprietary information relating to our business; inability to process client or company transactions and processes; breach and termination of client contracts; liability for stolen assets, information or identity; remediation costs to repair damage caused by the breach, including damage to systems and recovery of lost data; additional security costs to mitigate against future incidents; regulatory actions (including fines and penalties, which could be material) and litigation costs resulting from the incident. such consequences could result in material financial loss and have a negative effect on our revenues and profitability.
if we are unable to successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity problem, we could suffer material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.
if we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as a pandemic or other natural or man-made disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. in such an event, we believe our operational size, the multiple locations from which we operate, and our existing back-up systems should mitigate adverse impacts. nevertheless, we could still experience near-term operational problems with regard to particular areas of our operations. further, as we strive to achieve cost savings by shifting certain business processes to lower-cost geographic locations such as india, the potential for particular types of natural or man-made disasters, political, economic or infrastructure instabilities, or other country- or region-specific business continuity risks increases. although we seek to assess regularly and improve our existing business continuity plans, a major disaster, or one that affected certain important operating areas, or our inability to recover successfully should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.
since many of our subsidiary operations are located outside of the united states and have functional currencies other than the u.s. dollar, changes in the exchange rates to the u.s. dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the next.
the largest component of our net assets, revenues and expenses, as well as our aum, is presently denominated in u.s. dollars. however, we have a large number of subsidiaries outside of the united states whose functional currencies are not the u.s. dollar. as a result, fluctuations in the exchange rates to the u.s. dollar affect our reported financial results from one period to the next. consequently, significant strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to the u.k. pound sterling, euro, or canadian dollar, among other currencies, could have a material negative impact on our reported financial results.
22
the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet could become impaired, which would adversely affect our results of operations.
we have goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet that are subject to annual impairment reviews. we also have definite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet that are subject to impairment testing if indicators of impairment are identified. goodwill and intangible assets totaled $6,590.7 million and $1,558.7 million, respectively, at december 31, 2017. we may not realize the value of such assets. we perform impairment reviews of the book values of these assets on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. a variety of factors could cause such book values to become impaired. should valuations be deemed to be impaired, a write-down of the related assets would occur, adversely affecting our results of operations for the period. see item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - critical accounting policies - goodwill" and "- intangibles," for additional details of our impairment analysis process.
legislative and other measures that may be taken by u.s. and/or other governmental authorities could materially increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
under current laws, as the company is domiciled and tax resident in bermuda, taxation in other jurisdictions is dependent upon the types and the extent of the activities of the company undertaken in those jurisdictions. there is a risk that changes in either the types of activities undertaken by the company or changes in tax rules relating to tax residency could subject the company and its shareholders to additional taxation.
on october 21, 2016, the united states treasury and the irs published final and temporary regulations under section 385 of the internal revenue code ("385 regulations") that target the inbound financing of a foreign-parented multinational group's u.s. subsidiaries. there are no immediate impacts to the company's financial position as a result of the application of the 385 regulations, in particular, as there are broad exceptions for intercompany loans that are short-term in form and substance (cash pooling, short term advances, short-term ordinary course of business payables, etc.). on a go forward basis, the 385 regulations could limit our ability to efficiently finance or otherwise choose between debt and equity transactions with our u.s. subsidiaries.
the international tax environment continues to change as a result of both coordinated actions by governments and unilateral measures designed by individual countries, both intended to tackle concerns over base erosion and profit shifting (beps) and perceived international tax avoidance techniques. the recommendations of the beps project led by the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) are involved in much of the coordinated activity. as with any global implementation process there are concerns about potential lack of consistency in the local application of these items. some of the recommendations are complex while others contain optional routes, thereby increasing the likelihood of only partial or limited implementation. although the timing and methods of implementation vary, several jurisdictions have enacted legislation that is aligned with, and in some cases exceeds the scope of, the oecd's recommendations. this could lead to increased uncertainty with tax positions as well as increase the potential for double taxation.
we continually assess the impact of various u.s. federal, state and foreign legislative proposals, and modifications to existing tax treaties between the united states and foreign countries, which could result in a material increase in our u.s. federal, state or foreign taxes. we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. however, if such proposals were to be enacted, or if modifications were to be made to certain existing tax treaties, the consequences could have a materially adverse impact on the company, including increasing our tax burden, increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our future results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
the tax cuts and jobs act (the 2017 tax act) enacted on december 22, 2017, significantly reformed the taxation of business entities. the new legislation, among other things, includes changes to u.s. federal tax rates, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures, and puts into effect the migration from a "worldwide" system of taxation to a territorial system. we continue to examine the impact of this new legislation and the ultimate outcome of the new legislation on our business and financial condition. see also item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - in note 15, "taxation," for further details and additional discussion on estimated amounts recorded as of december 31, 2017 for the 2017 tax act.
23
examinations and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.
the company and its subsidiaries are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes (and, in certain cases, interest, fines or penalties). we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional income taxes will be due. we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances. due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, however, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities.
the european commission ("ec") continues to investigate certain transfer pricing rulings given by member states to particular taxpayers that it believes may have violated the eu restriction on state aid. the investigation was triggered by the oecd / beps action plan as well as the eu's own agenda to tackle aggressive tax planning and tax avoidance. there is considerable uncertainty with the approach being taken, including retroactive application (10 year period), conflicts with oecd transfer pricing guidelines and implications to bilateral tax treaties. while the company does not believe it has received state aid and is not a party to any investigation, due to the uncertainty of the process and retroactive nature of the assessments any potential future findings could have a materially adverse impact on the company, including increasing our tax burden, increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our future results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to shareholders.
our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than shareholders of a company incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states. as a bermuda company, we are governed by the companies act 1981 of bermuda (companies act). the companies act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to united states corporations and shareholders, including provisions relating to interested directors, mergers, amalgamations and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors.
under bermuda law, the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only. shareholders of bermuda companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company, and may only do so in limited circumstances described in the following paragraph. however, directors and officers may owe duties to a company's creditors in cases of impending insolvency. directors and officers of a bermuda company must, in exercising their powers and performing their duties, act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company and must exercise the care and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances. directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests may conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any material contract or proposed material contract with the company or any of its subsidiaries. if a director or officer of a bermuda company is found to have breached such director's duties to that company, the director may be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty.
class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda. however, the bermuda courts ordinarily would be expected to follow english case law precedent, which would permit a shareholder to commence an action in a company's name against the directors and officers to remedy a wrong done to the company where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the company's corporate power or is illegal or would result in the violation of the company's memorandum of association or bye-laws. furthermore, consideration would be given by the court to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of shareholders than actually approved it. under our second amended and restated bye-laws (bye-laws), each of our shareholders agrees to waive any claim or right of action, both individually and on our behalf, other than those involving fraud or dishonesty, against the company or any of our officers, directors or employees. the waiver applies to any action taken by a director, officer or employee, or the failure of such person to take any action, in the performance of his or her duties, except with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the director, officer or employee. this waiver limits the right of shareholders to assert claims against our directors, officers and employees unless the act or failure to act involves fraud or dishonesty.
our bye-laws also provide for indemnification of our directors and officers in respect of any loss arising or liability attaching to them in respect of any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust of which a director or officer may be guilty in relation to the company other than in respect of his or her own fraud or dishonesty, which is the maximum extent of indemnification permitted under the companies act.
24
because we are incorporated in bermuda, it may be difficult for shareholders to serve process or enforce judgments against us or our directors and officers.
the company is organized under the laws of bermuda. in addition, certain of our officers and directors reside in countries outside the united states. a substantial portion of the company's assets and the assets of these officers and directors are or may be located outside the united states. investors may have difficulty effecting service of process within the united states on our directors and officers who reside outside the united states or recovering against the company or these directors and officers on judgments of u.s. courts based on civil liabilities provisions of the u.s. federal securities laws, even though the company has appointed an agent in the united states to receive service of process.
further, it may not be possible in bermuda or in countries other than the united states where the company has assets to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against the company based on the civil liability provisions of u.s. federal or state securities laws. in addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of bermuda and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of u.s. courts obtained against the company or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the u.s. federal or state securities laws or would hear actions against the company or those persons based on those laws. we have been advised by our legal advisors in bermuda that the united states and bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. some remedies available under the laws of the united states or the states therein, including some remedies available under the u.s. federal securities laws, may not be allowed in bermuda courts because they may be found to be contrary to bermuda public policy. therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on u.s. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in bermuda. similarly, those judgments may not be enforceable in other countries other than the united states.
we have anti-takeover provisions in our bye-laws that may discourage a change of control.
our bye-laws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us or to obtain majority representation on our board of directors without the consent of our board. as a result, shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares under such circumstances.
specifically, our bye-laws contain the following provisions that may impede or delay an unsolicited takeover of the company:
•   we are prohibited from engaging, under certain circumstances, in a business combination (as defined in our bye-laws) with any interested shareholder (as defined in our bye-laws) for three years following the date that the shareholder became an interested shareholder;
•   our board of directors, without further shareholder action, is permitted by our bye-laws to issue preference shares, in one or more series, and determine by resolution any designations, preferences, qualifications, privileges, limitations, restrictions, or special or relative rights of an additional series. the rights of preferred shareholders may supersede the rights of common shareholders;
•   shareholders may only remove directors for "cause" (defined in our bye-laws to mean willful misconduct or gross negligence which is materially injurious to the company, fraud or embezzlement, or a conviction of, or a plea of "guilty" or "no contest" to, a felony);
•   our board of directors is authorized to expand its size and fill vacancies; and
•   shareholders cannot act by written consent unless the consent is unanimous.
our independent registered public accounting firm has advised us that it identified an issue related to an independence requirement contained in the securities exchange act of 1934 regulations regarding auditor independence.
in may 2016, pricewaterhousecoopers llp (pwc) advised the company that it had identified an issue related to its independence under rule 2-01(c)(1)(ii)(a) of regulation s-x (loan rule) with respect to certain of pwc's lenders who own certain invesco registered funds managed by certain of our wholly-owned investment adviser subsidiaries. the company and such funds are required to have their financial statements audited by a public accounting firm that qualifies as independent under various sec rules. as discussed below, the staff of the securities and exchange commission (sec staff) has issued a "no-action" letter to another mutual fund complex under substantially similar circumstances and subsequently issued a letter extending the relief provided by the such letter indefinitely.
the loan rule prohibits accounting firms, such as pwc, from having certain financial relationships with their audit clients and affiliated entities. specifically, the loan rule provides, in relevant part, that an accounting firm is not independent if it receives a loan from a lender that is a "record or beneficial owner of more than ten percent of the audit client's equity securities." for purposes of the loan rule, audit clients include all of the registered investment companies advised by affiliates of the company, as well as the company and its other subsidiaries (collectively, the invesco funds complex) for which pwc also serves as
25
independent auditor. pwc informed the company it has relationships with lenders who hold, as record owner, more than ten percent of the shares of certain funds within the invesco fund complex. these relationships call into question pwc's independence under the loan rule with respect to those funds, as well as all other funds in the invesco fund complex and the company and its subsidiaries.
in june 2016, the sec staff issued a "no-action" letter to another mutual fund complex (see fidelity management & research company et al., no-action letter) related to the audit independence issue described above. in that letter, the sec staff confirmed that it would not recommend enforcement action against an audit client that relied on audit services performed by an audit firm that was not in compliance with the loan rule in certain specified circumstances. the circumstances described in the no-action letter are substantially similar to the circumstances that called into question pwc's independence under the loan rule with respect to the invesco funds complex, including the company. the company therefore believes that the invesco funds complex can rely on the letter to continue to issue financial statements that are audited by pwc and we intend to do so. in september 2017, the sec staff issued a letter extending the relief in the june 2016 no-action letter referenced above. the extension makes no changes to the circumstances in the original no-action letter and does not include a new expiration date, providing indefinite relief.
if in the future the independence of pwc is called into question under the loan rule by circumstances that are not addressed in the sec staff's no-action letter, the company will need to take other action and incur additional costs in order for the company's filings with the sec containing financial statements to be deemed compliant with applicable securities laws. such action may include obtaining the review and audit of the financial statements filed by the company by another independent registered public accounting firm. in addition, under such circumstances, the company's eligibility to issue securities under its existing registration statements on form s-3 and forms s-8 may be impacted and certain financial reporting covenants with our lenders may be impacted. there could be other burdensome requirements or impacts on other entities (including registered funds) included in the invesco funds complex. such consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
insurance may not be available at a reasonable cost to protect us from liability.
we face the inherent risk of liability related to claims from clients, third-party vendors or others, actions taken by regulatory agencies and costs and losses associated with cyber incidents. to help protect against these risks, we purchase insurance in amounts, and against potential liabilities, that we consider appropriate, where such insurance is available at prices we deem reasonable. there can be no assurance, however, that a claim or claims will be covered by insurance or, if covered, will not exceed coverage limits, or that an insurer will meet its obligations regarding coverage, or that coverage will continue to be available on a cost effective basis. insurance costs are impacted by market conditions and the risk profile of the insured, and may increase significantly over relatively short periods. in addition, certain insurance coverage may not be available or may only be available at prohibitive costs. renewals of insurance policies may expose us to additional costs through higher premiums or the assumption of higher deductibles or co-insurance liability.
item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview the following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented. this overview and the remainder of this management's discussion and analysis supplements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of invesco ltd. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "company" or "invesco") and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
global financial markets in 2017 saw strong returns resulting from healthy economic indicators, improving macroeconomic data, and the expectation for benefits from tax reform in the u.s. equity markets continued a rally that began the previous year as strong corporate earnings, low unemployment, and improving inflation measures helped to spur the strengthening outlook. in
30
the u.s., higher interest rates and better jobs data helped the markets early in the year. the passing of tax reform, including a significant corporate tax rate reduction late in the year, led equity markets higher with the s&p finishing the year at all-time highs up 19.4%.
european markets similarly benefited from improving confidence and outlook for future growth, as the plan for the uk's exit from the eu continued to take shape. the european central bank indicated the potential for a slowing of economic stimulus. the bank of england increased interest rates, which helped to push the ftse 100 higher, finishing the year up 7.6%.
strong corporate results in asia, continued optimism for global growth, and stability for japan's government after the results of a snap election late in the year led the nikkei higher finishing the year up 19.1%.
bond markets were broadly positive during 2017. accommodative monetary policy drove corporate and high-yield bond outperformance, while government bonds underperformed on rising interest rate expectations and future changes in central bank policies. overall, the barclay's u.s. aggregate bond index finished the year up 3.5%.

throughout 2017, we continued to execute on our long-term strategic objectives, which further improved our ability to serve clients, strengthened our investment performance and helped us deliver competitive levels of operating income and margins. we also took advantage of opportunities in the market and further invested in our products and capabilities, our global platform and our people in ways that strengthened our business and further differentiated us in the marketplace to help ensure our long-term success.
in addition, we benefited from our long-term efforts to ensure a diversified base of assets under management. one of invesco's core strengths, and a key differentiator for the company within the industry, is our broad diversification across client domiciles, asset classes and distribution channels. our geographical diversification allows us to recognize growth opportunities in various markets in different parts of the world. this broad diversification mitigates the impact on invesco of different market cycles.
as of the filing of this report, invesco held credit ratings of a2/stable, a/negative and a-/stable from moody's investor services moody's, s&p, and fitch, respectively.
one of the company's strategic objectives is to harness the power of our global platform, improving effectiveness and efficiency by allocating our resources to the opportunities that will best benefit clients and our business. consistent with this objective, business optimization charges of $58.0 million were recorded in 2017, including $30.0 million of staff severance costs recorded in employee compensation expense associated with a business transformation initiative. this is a continuation of efforts to transform several key business support functions to become more effective and efficient by leveraging shared service centers, outsourcing, automation of key processes and optimization of the company's office footprint. given the size of the opportunity on certain initiatives, including outsourcing of back office functions, the optimization work will continue past the original targeted completion date, and spending has increased. this optimization work will make invesco a stronger company, further increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of our global platform and will allow us to fund crucial strategic initiatives. as of the end of 2017, this initiative
31
had produced annualized run-rate expense savings of $43.8 million. these savings have helped offset acquisition and regulatory-related increases in operating expenses. incremental implementation costs in 2018 are estimated to be up to $35 million, and the initiative is expected to generate annualized run-rate expense savings of up to $65 million by completion.
the investment management industry is subject to extensive levels of ongoing regulatory oversight and examination. in the u.s., u.k., and other jurisdictions in which the company operates, governmental authorities regularly make inquiries, conduct investigations and administer examinations with respect to compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
the markets in financial instrument directive (mifid ii) became effective in europe in january 2018. invesco is committed to ensuring our investment professionals have access to the external research market in order to achieve our long-term investment performance goals. therefore, the company has announced that, beginning in january 2018, external research costs incurred for mifid ii impacting funds and client accounts in europe have been absorbed by the company. we do not expect these costs to be material to the company's financial statements.
on august 18, 2017, invesco acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of the european etf business. our european etf business is a leading independent specialist provider of etfs based in europe, which added $26.0 billion in aum (including approximately $7 billion of externally managed aum) at acquisition date. the combination strengthens invesco's existing factor-based capabilities, provides additional scale and relevance in the european etf market and enhances the firm's ability to meet client needs globally.
as previously announced, the company has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire guggenheim investments' etf business, which includes 76 etfs with $38.4 billion of assets under management as of december 31, 2017. the acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018 for an anticipated purchase price of $1.2 billion to be paid in cash. the acquisition will expand the depth, breadth and diversity of invesco's traditional and smart beta etfs, while providing additional scale and relevance in the global growing etf market. it will also build on our existing self-indexing capability and bring in highly complementary capabilities that further strengthen our ability to deliver the outcomes clients seek and position us for accelerated growth in the future.
on december 22, 2017, the 2017 tax act was signed into law. the 2017 tax act, among other items, reduces the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018. our intention is to use the additional cash flow generated from the lower tax rate first to reduce the anticipated future outstanding balance on the credit facility resulting from the guggenheim acquisition. after the acquisition is complete and the credit facility balance is reduced, any residual excess will follow our capital management priorities.
invesco continues to demonstrate its commitment to supporting financial advisors with industry leading tools and resources, as we believe these areas are key to delivering superior investment experiences. the range of investment capabilities available through jemstep are broad across the firm's active, alternative and etf offerings. additionally, jemstep offers open architecture to help advisors provide customized solutions for clients. as a market-leading provider of digital solutions, jemstep continues to expand its capabilities and market presence, and is an integral part of invesco's growth strategy.
presentation of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations -- impact of consolidated investment products the company provides investment management services to, and has transactions with, various retail mutual funds and similar entities, private equity, real estate, fund-of-funds, collateralized loan obligation products (clos), and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. the company serves as the investment manager, making day-to-day investment decisions concerning the assets of the products. investment products that are consolidated are referred to in this form 10-k (report) as consolidated investments products (cip). cip includes all variable and voting interest entities, as applicable, with effect from the adoption of asu 2015-02. the company's economic risk with respect to each investment in cip is limited to its equity ownership and any uncollected management and performance fees. the company is required to consolidate certain managed funds from time-to-time, as discussed more fully in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, note 1 -- "accounting policies -- basis of accounting and consolidation."
the majority of the company's cip balances are clo-related. the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos. the company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the clos, beyond the company's direct investments in, and management and performance fees generated from, the clos. if the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. likewise, the investors in the clos have no recourse to
32
the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the clos. the company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability.
the impact of cip is so significant to the presentation of the company's consolidated financial statements that the company has elected to deconsolidate these products in its non-gaap disclosures. this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains four distinct sections, which follow after the assets under management discussion:
•   results of operations (years ended december 31, 2017 compared to december 31, 2016 compared to december 31, 2015);
•   schedule of non-gaap information;
•   balance sheet discussion; and
•   liquidity and capital resources.
to assess the impact of cip on the company's results of operations and balance sheet discussion, refer to part ii, item 8, financial statements, note 19, "consolidated investment products." the impact on the company's results of operations is illustrated by a column which shows the dollar-value change in the consolidated figures, as caused by the consolidation of cip. for example, the impact of cip on operating revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017 was a reduction of $32.4 million. this indicates that their consolidation reduced consolidated revenues by this amount, reflecting the elimination upon their consolidation of the operating revenues earned by invesco for managing these investment products.
wherever a non-gaap measure is referenced, a disclosure will follow in the narrative or in the note referring the reader to the schedule of non-gaap information, where additional details regarding the use of the non-gaap measure by the company are disclosed, along with reconciliations of the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measures to the non-gaap measures. to further enhance the readability of the results of operations section, separate tables for each of the revenue, expense, and other income and expenses (non-operating income/expense) sections of the income statement introduce the narrative that follows, providing a section-by-section review of the company's income statements for the periods presented.

(1)   net revenues is a non-gaap financial measure. net revenues are operating revenues plus our proportional share of the net revenues of our joint venture investments, less third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, plus management and performance fees earned from cip. see "schedule of non-gaap information" for the reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues.
33
(2)   adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin are non-gaap financial measures. adjusted operating margin is adjusted operating income divided by net revenues. adjusted operating income includes operating income plus our proportional share of the net operating income of our joint venture investments, the operating income impact of the consolidation of investment products, acquisition/disposition related adjustments, compensation expense related to market valuation changes in deferred compensation plans, and other reconciling items. see "schedule of non-gaap information," for the reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income.
(3)   adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd. and adjusted diluted eps are non-gaap financial measures. adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd. is net income attributable to invesco ltd. adjusted to exclude the net income of cip, add back acquisition/disposition related adjustments, the net income impact of deferred compensation plans and other reconciling items. adjustments made to net income attributable to invesco ltd. are tax-effected in arriving at adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd. by calculation, adjusted diluted eps is adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd. divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (for diluted eps). see "schedule of non-gaap information," for the reconciliation of net income attributable to invesco ltd. to adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd..

assets under management the following presentation and discussion of aum includes passive and active aum. passive aum includes etfs, unit investment trusts (uits), certain non-fee earning leverage and other passive mandates. active aum is total aum less passive aum.
the aum tables and the discussion below refer to aum as long-term. as of december 31, 2017, the company changed the presentation of long-term inflows, outflows and aum to exclude uits and product leverage. non-management fee earning aum now includes invesco powershares qqq, uits and product leverage. in the aum tables below, all periods have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation. the net flows in non-management fee earning aum can be relatively short-term in nature and, due to the relatively low revenue yield, these can have a significant impact on overall net revenue yield. all periods have been reclassified to conform to the new presentation.
long-term inflows and the underlying reasons for the movements in this line item include investments from new clients, existing clients adding new accounts/funds or contributions/subscriptions into existing accounts/funds, and new funding commitments into private equity funds. beginning with the six months ended december 31, 2017, reinvested dividends and capital gains are included in long-term inflows to be consistent with general industry practice. for previous periods, reinvested dividends and capital gains were included in market gains and losses. long-term outflows reflect client redemptions from accounts/funds and include the return of invested capital on the maturity or liquidation of private equity funds. we present net flows into institutional money market funds separately because shareholders of those funds typically use them as short-term funding vehicles and because their flows are particularly sensitive to short-term interest rate movements.
changes in aum were as follows:

(1)   for the six months ended december 31, 2017, reinvested dividends and capital gains of $7.0 billion are included in long-term inflows. for previous periods, reinvested dividends and capital gains are included in market gains and losses.
(2)   gross revenue yield on aum is equal to annualized total operating revenues divided by average aum, excluding joint venture (jv) aum. our share of the average aum in 2017 for our jvs in china was $8.5 billion (2016: $9.2 billion, 2015: $6.1 billion). it is appropriate to exclude the average aum of our jvs for purposes of computing gross revenue yield on aum, because the revenues resulting from these
37
aum are not presented in our operating revenues. under u.s. gaap, our share of the net income of the jvs is recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on our consolidated statements of income. additionally, the numerator of the gross revenue yield measure, operating revenues, excludes the management fees earned from cip; however, the denominator of the measure includes the aum of these investment products. therefore, the gross revenue yield measure is not considered representative of the company's true effective fee rate from aum.
(3)   net revenue yield on aum is equal to annualized net revenues divided by average aum. see "schedule of non-gaap information" for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues.
flows there are numerous drivers of aum inflows and outflows, including individual investor decisions to change investment preferences, fiduciaries and other gatekeepers making broad asset allocation decisions on behalf of their clients and reallocation of investments within portfolios. we are not a party to these asset allocation decisions, as the company does not generally have access to the underlying investor's decision-making process, including their risk appetite or liquidity needs. therefore, the company is not in a position to provide meaningful information regarding the drivers of inflows and outflows.
aum at december 31, 2017 were $937.6 billion (december 31, 2016: $812.9 billion; december 31, 2015: $775.6 billion). during the year ended december 31, 2017, long-term net inflows and net inflows in non-management fee earning aum increased aum by $11.5 billion and $3.0 billion respectively, offset by net outflows of institutional money market funds of $3.2 billion. for the six months ended december 31, 2017, long-term net inflows included an inflow of $7.0 billion related to reinvested dividends and capital gains. for previous periods, reinvested dividends and capital gains are included in market gains and losses. during the year ended december 31, 2016, long-term net inflows and net inflows of institutional money market funds increased aum by $16.5 billion and $12.8 billion, respectively, offset by net outflows in non-management fee earning aum of $6.4 billion. during the year ended december 31, 2015, long-term net inflows increased aum by $16.6 billion, offset by net outflows in institutional money market funds of $11.9 billion and net outflows in non-management fee earning aum of $2.2 billion.
net inflows during the year ended december 31, 2017 included long-term net active inflows of $6.8 billion and net inflows of passive aum of $4.7 billion. long-term net inflows included net inflows from our retail distribution channel of $12.4 billion and net outflows from our institutional distribution channel of $0.9 billion. by asset class, long-term net flows were positive for the fixed income, balanced and alternatives classes, and were negative for the equity asset class. long-term net inflows included $12.8 billion and $1.3 billion from clients domiciled in continental europe and asia, respectively, offset by long-term net outflows of $1.3 billion, $1.0 billion and $0.3 billion from clients domiciled in the u.k., u.s., and canada, respectively.
net inflows during the year ended december 31, 2016 included long-term net active inflows of $6.9 billion and net inflows of passive aum of $9.6 billion. long-term net inflows were split between our institutional distribution channel of $12.1 billion and our retail distribution channel of $4.4 billion. by asset class, long-term net flows were positive for the fixed income and alternatives classes, and were negative for the equity and balanced asset classes. long-term net inflows included $15.5 billion and $5.9 billion from clients domiciled in asia and the u.s., respectively, offset by long-term net outflows of $3.3 billion, $1.1 billion and $0.5 billion from clients domiciled in continental europe, canada and the u.k., respectively.
net inflows during the year ended december 31, 2015 included long-term net inflows of active aum of $14.1 billion and passive aum of $2.5 billion. net flows in 2015 were split between net inflows of $14.1 billion into our institutional distribution channel and $2.5 billion into our retail distribution channel.
average aum during the year ended december 31, 2017 were $875.0 billion, compared to $788.8 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016 and $794.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015.
market returns market gains and losses include the net change in aum resulting from changes in market values of the underlying securities from period to period. as discussed in the "executive overview" section of this management's discussion and analysis, during 2017, global markets saw strong returns for the year. see below for a discussion of the impact of foreign exchange rates on aum.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, positive market movement increased aum by $66.0 billion, with gains in all asset classes, with the most significant gains arising from the equity asset class. during the year ended december 31, 2016, positive market movement increased aum by $37.7 billion, with gains in each asset asset class, most significantly from the equity asset class. during the year ended december 31, 2015, negative market movement decreased aum by $2.6 billion, with declines in the alternatives, fixed income and balanced asset classes, partially offset by gains in the equity asset class.

foreign exchange rates during the year ended december 31, 2017, we experienced increases in aum of $21.4 billion due to changes in foreign exchange rates (december 31, 2016: aum decreased by $22.1 billion; december 31, 2015: aum decreased by $16.0 billion). see the company's disclosures regarding the changes in foreign exchange rates in the "foreign exchange impact on balance sheet, assets under management and results of operations" section above for additional information regarding the movement of foreign exchange rates.
acquisitions and dispositions during the year ended december 31, 2017, we completed the acquisition of the european etf business, which added $26.0 billion in passive etf aum (including approximately $7 billion of externally managed aum) at date of purchase. for the year ended december 31, 2016, dispositions of $2.7 billion related to the deconsolidation of certain securitization trusts by invesco mortgage capital inc. (ivr) and other aum dispositions were partially offset by the acquisition of the controlling interest of invesco asset management (india) private limited, which added $2.4 billion to aum. for the year ended december 31, 2015, dispositions resulted in a $0.7 billion decrease in aum, representing exchange traded notes that did not transfer over as part of the agreement with deutsche bank to transition the investment management of the powershares db suite of commodity exchange traded funds to invesco.
revenue yield gross revenue yield on aum decreased 1.1 basis points to 59.6 basis points in the year ended december 31, 2017 from the year ended december 31, 2016 level of 60.7 basis points (december 31, 2015: 65.0 basis points). management does not consider gross revenue yield, the most comparable u.s. gaap-based measure to net revenue yield, to be a meaningful effective fee rate measure for the reasons outlined in footnote 3 to the changes in aum table above. see "schedule of non-gaap information" for a reconciliation of operating revenues (gross revenues) to net revenues.
net revenue yield on aum decreased 0.1 basis point to 42.9 basis points in the year ended december 31, 2017 from the year ended december 31, 2016 level of 43.0 basis points (december 31, 2015: 45.8 basis points). excluding performance fees, the net revenue yield decreased 0.9 basis points to 41.5 basis points in the year ended december 31, 2017 from the year ended december 31, 2016 level of 42.4 basis points (december 31, 2015: 44.6 basis points).
changes in our aum mix can significantly impact our net revenue yield. passive aum generally earn a lower effective fee rate than active asset classes. at december 31, 2017, passive aum were $199.0 billion, representing 21.2% of total aum at that date; whereas at december 31, 2016, passive aum were $144.4 billion, representing 17.8% of our total aum at that date. this proportional increase in passive aum correlates with the decline in net revenue yield in 2017 when compared to 2016. the acquisition of the european etf business in the third quarter of 2017 increased the level of passive aum and has a dilutive impact on the company's overall net revenue yield. the anticipated acquisition of the guggenheim etf business in the second quarter of 2018 will increase passive balances and will have a further dilutive impact on the company's overall net revenue yield. passive aum also increased due to non-management fee earning aum, which increased to $87.8 billion at december 31, 2017 compared to $71.3 billion at december 31, 2016 ($78.1 billion at december 31, 2015). in the year ended december 31, 2017, the net revenue yield on passive aum was 16.3 basis points compared to 15.3 basis points in the year ended december 31, 2016, an increase of 1.0 basis points, due to changes in mix of passive aum.
additionally, as a significant proportion of our aum is based outside of the u.s., changes in foreign exchange rates result in a change to the mix of u.s. dollar denominated aum with aum denominated in other currencies. as fee rates differ across geographic locations, changes to exchange rates have an impact on the net revenue yields. see the company's disclosures regarding the changes in foreign exchange rates in the "foreign exchange impact on balance sheet, assets under management and results of operations" section above for additional information regarding the movement of foreign exchange rates.

*   net revenues are operating revenues less third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, plus our proportional share of net revenues from joint venture arrangements, plus management and performance fees earned from cip. see "schedule of non-gaap information" for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues.
operating revenues increased by 9.0% in the year ended december 31, 2017 to $5,160.3 million (year ended december 31, 2016: $4,734.4 million). net revenues increased by 10.7% in the year ended december 31, 2017 to $3,754.9 million (year ended december 31, 2016: $3,393.2 million). operating revenues decreased by 7.6% in the year ended december 31, 2016 to $4,734.4 million (year ended december 31, 2015: $5,122.9 million). net revenues decreased by 6.9% in the year ended december 31, 2016 to $3,393.2 million (year ended december 31, 2015: $3,643.2 million).
the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased operating revenues by $35.3 million, equivalent to 0.7% of total operating revenues, during the year ended december 31, 2017 when compared to the year ended december 31, 2016 ($136.8 million decrease in 2016 as compared to 2015, or 2.9% of 2016 total operating revenues).
additionally, our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our aum. therefore, movements in global capital market levels, net new business inflows (or outflows) and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period. market movements are discussed in the "executive overview" section of this management's discussion and analysis. during 2017 foreign exchange rate changes and net market gains resulted in a 10.9% increase in average aum when compared to 2016.

see item 8., financial statements and supplementary data, note 1, "accounting policies -- revenue recognition" for more information regarding the components of each operating revenue category as well as third party distribution, service and advisory expenses.
investment management fees investment management fees increased by $353.5 million (9.4%) in the year ended december 31, 2017, to $4,126.6 million (year ended december 31, 2016: $3,773.1 million). this compares to a 10.9% increase in average aum. the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased investment management fees by $36.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. after allowing for foreign exchange movements, investment management fees increased by $389.9 million. in addition to foreign exchange rate movements, the change in product mix of aum results in changes in the average revenue yield derived from aum due to differing fee rates and structures, which impacts our management fees. investment management fees in 2017 also include incremental management fees from the acquisition of the european etf business.
investment management fees decreased by $288.0 million (7.1%) in the year ended december 31, 2016, to $3,773.1 million (year ended december 31, 2015: $4,061.1 million). the decrease compares to a 0.7% decrease in average aum. the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased investment management fees by $133.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the pound sterling and euro has reduced the weighting of higher fee earning aum attributable to the u.k. and continental european products in 2016 when compared to 2015. after allowing for foreign exchange movements, investment management fees decreased by $154.1 million.
see the company's disclosures regarding the changes in aum and revenue yields during the years ended december 31, 2017, december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015 in the "assets under management" section above for additional information regarding the movements in aum.
service and distribution fees in the year ended december 31, 2017, service and distribution fees increased by $29.2 million (3.5%) to $852.8 million (year ended december 31, 2016: $823.6 million). the impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased service and distribution fees by $0.6 million during the year ended december 31, 2017. after allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in service and distribution fees was $28.5 million. the increase during 2017 is due to increases in distribution and redemption fees of $20.9 million and administration fees of $16.8 million, partially offset by decreases in transfer agency fees of $8.2 million and service and custodial fees of $0.9 million. the increase relates to increases in aum that earn these fees and the full year impact of fee revenue from the collegebound 529 plan which was funded in july 2016.
in the year ended december 31, 2016, service and distribution fees decreased by $31.8 million (3.7%) to $823.6 million (year ended december 31, 2015: $855.4 million). the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased service and distribution fees by $1.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2016. after allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the decrease in service and distribution fees was $30.8 million. the decrease in service and distribution fees during 2016 is due to decreases in administration fees of $16.3 million, distribution and redemption fees of $5.9 million, transfer agency fees of $8.0 million and service and custodial fees of $0.7 million. the decrease relates to decreases in aum that earn these fees.
performance fees in the year ended december 31, 2017, performance fees increased by $69.0 million (155.8%) to $113.3 million (year ended december 31, 2016: $44.3 million). foreign exchange movements increased performance fees by $0.6 million in 2017 as compared to 2016. after allowing for foreign exchange movements, performance fees increased by $68.4 million. the increase in 2017 included $36.8 million of performance fee generated by invesco's mortgage recovery fund. in addition, we recognized $28.9 million from real estate, $13.1 million from bank loans, $12.9 million from u.k. investment trusts, $7.1 million from private equity, $5.3 million from institutional, $5.2 million from asia-pacific and $4.1 million from fixed income. of our $937.6 billion in aum at december 31, 2017, approximately $48.1 billion or 5.1%, could potentially earn performance fees, including carried interests and performance fees related to partnership investments and separate accounts.
in the year ended december 31, 2016, performance fees decreased by $41.6 million (48.4%) to $44.3 million (year ended december 31, 2015: $85.9 million). the performance fees generated in 2016 arose primarily due to products managed by the following investment teams: u.k. investment teams ($17.6 million), u.s. bank loans ($8.4 million), global asset allocation ($6.7 million), direct real estate europe ($5.4 million) and quantitative strategies ($3.7 million).
47
the performance fees generated in 2015 arose primarily due to products managed by the following investment teams: direct real estate ($51.0 million), u.k. equities ($25.4 million), asia pacific teams ($1.5 million), and global quantitative equity team ($5.6 million)
other revenues in the year ended december 31, 2017, other revenues decreased by $25.8 million (27.6%) to $67.6 million (year ended december 31, 2016: $93.4 million). the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased other revenues $0.1 million during the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. after allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the decrease in other revenues was $25.7 million. the decrease in other revenues includes decreases in mutual fund front end fees of $16.4 million, which continue to decrease as investors move into clean share classes. other decreases include real estate transaction fees of $6.3 million, other revenues and transaction fees of $2.4 million and uit revenues of $0.8 million during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016.
in the year ended december 31, 2016, other revenues decreased by $27.1 million (22.5%) to $93.4 million (year ended december 31, 2015: $120.5 million). the impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased other revenues by $0.1 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. after allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the decrease in other revenues was $27.2 million. the decrease in other revenues includes decreases in mutual fund front end fees of $13.2 million related to the transition of investors into clean share classes, uit revenues of $12.7 million, other revenues and transaction fees of $1.3 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. uit revenues declined due to decrease in net flows of short-term equity uits due to uncertainty surrounding the impact of the new fiduciary rules from the u. s. department of labor.
third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses increased by $79.3 million (5.6%) in the year ended december 31, 2017 to $1,486.5 million (year ended december 31, 2016: $1,407.2 million). the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses by $6.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. after allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses increased by $85.7 million. the increase includes increases in renewal commissions of $45.9 million, asset and sales based fees of $22.1 million, service related expenses of $15.7 million, and other expenses of $5.5 million. these increases include the full year impact of distribution fee expense from the collegebound 529 plan which was funded in july 2016, and also include the continued impact of investors moving into clean share classes.
third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses decreased by $172.7 million (10.9%) in the year ended december 31, 2016 to $1,407.2 million (year ended december 31, 2015: $1,579.9 million). the impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses by $29.6 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. after allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses decreased by $143.1 million. the decrease includes decreases in rebates of $100.0 million, renewal commissions of $32.6 million, service fees of $15.4 million, front end commissions of $7.2 million, and other expenses of $2.6 million. these decreases include the continued impact of the transition to clean share classes, as investors move into share classes that do not pay distribution fees. the decreases are partially offset by an increase in asset and sales based fees of $13.1 million.
proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture arrangements should be added to operating revenues to arrive at net revenues, as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that our joint venture arrangements are making. see "schedule of non-gaap information" for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. the company's most significant joint venture arrangement is our 49% investment in invesco great wall fund management company limited (the "invesco great wall" joint venture).
our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments increased by $5.0 million (11.4%) to $48.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 (year ended december 31, 2016: $43.7 million) primarily due to changes in asset classes which resulted in higher yield. our share of the invesco great wall joint venture's average aum for the year ended december 31, 2017 was $8.5 billion compared to $9.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016.
our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments decreased by $17.3 million (28.4%) to $43.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 (year ended december 31, 2015: $61.0 million). our share
48
of the invesco great wall joint venture's average aum for the year ended december 31, 2016, which was $9.2 billion, compared to $6.1 billion at the year ended december 31, 2015. although average aum has increased in the period, changes in the mix of these aum from higher fee-based equity aum into lower fee-based fixed income and other aum have resulted in a decrease in our proportional share of revenues.
management, performance and other fees earned from cip management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader's analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. accordingly, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues for the impact of cip in calculating net revenues. as management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products are eliminated upon consolidation of the investment products, management believes that it is appropriate to add these operating revenues back in the calculation of net revenues. see "schedule of non-gaap information" for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues.
the elimination of management and performance fees earned from cip increased by $10.1 million to $32.4 million in the year ended december 31, 2017 (year ended december 31, 2016: $22.3 million). the increase is primarily due to the increase in management fees earned from clos.
the elimination of management and performance fees earned from cip decreased by $16.9 million to $22.3 million in the year ended december 31, 2016 (year ended december 31, 2015: $39.2 million). the decrease is primarily due to the adoption of asu 2015-02, which resulted in the deconsolidation of certain vies (see note 1, "accounting policies," for the impact upon adoption), partially offset by the impact of newly consolidated funds, and decreased performance fees earned from cip in the period.

other gains and losses, net were a net gain of $22.9 million in the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to a net loss of $1.5 million in the year ended december 31, 2015. included within other gains and losses, net in the year ended december 31, 2016 are a gain of $22.0 million related to the mark-to-market of foreign exchange put option contracts intended to provide protection against the impact of a significant decline in the pound sterling/u.s dollar foreign exchange rate, a net gain of $11.2 million resulting from the appreciation of investments held for our deferred compensation plans and net gains of $3.0 million from other trading investments. these gains are partially offset by a net loss of $7.4 million related to an acquisition related change in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability and $6.0 million in net foreign exchange losses on the revaluation of intercompany foreign currency denominated loans into the various functional currencies of our subsidiaries. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, - note 14, "other gains and losses, net" for additional information.
other income/(expense) of cip upon adoption of asu 2015-02, the funds previously consolidated as csip became vies and are now consolidated as cip. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - notes 1, "accounting policies" " for additional details.
in the year ended december 31, 2017, interest and dividend income of cip increased by $16.3 million (8.3%) to $211.6 million (year ended december 31, 2016: $195.3 million). interest expense of cip increased by $31.8 million (25.7%) to $155.3 million (year ended december 31, 2016: $123.5 million). the increase in interest income and interest expense of cip in the year ended december 31, 2017 is primarily due to the impact of newly consolidated clos and other funds during the year.
in the year ended december 31, 2016, interest and dividend income of cip decreased by $57.7 million (22.8%) to $195.3 million (year ended december 31, 2015: $253.0 million). interest expense of cip decreased by $65.4 million (34.6%) to $123.5 million (year ended december 31, 2015: $188.9 million). the decrease in interest income and interest expense of cip in the year ended december 31, 2016 is primarily due to the impact of deconsolidation of clos upon adoption of asu 2015-02, partially offset by the impact of newly consolidated clos and other funds during 2016.
included in other gains/(losses) of cip, net, are realized and unrealized gains and losses on the underlying investments and debt of cip. in the year ended december 31, 2017, other gains and losses of cip were a net gain of $81.0 million, as compared to a net gain of $7.4 million in the year ended december 31, 2016. the net gains during 2017 were attributable to market-driven gains of investments held by consolidated funds. in the year ended december 31, 2016, other gains and losses of cip were a net gain of $7.4 million, as compared to a net loss of $37.0 million in the year ended december 31, 2015.

net impact of cip and related noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities the net impact to net income attributable to invesco ltd. in each period primarily represents the changes in the value of the company's holding in its consolidated clos, which is reclassified into other gains/(losses) from accumulated other comprehensive income upon consolidation. the consolidation of investment products during the year ended december 31, 2017 resulted in an increase to net income attributable to invesco ltd. of $2.3 million (year ended december 31, 2016: $3.0 million net increase). the consolidation of investment products during the year ended december 31, 2015 resulted in a decrease to net income attributable to invesco ltd. of $40.4 million.
noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities represent the profit or loss amounts attributed to third party investors in cip. the impact of any gains or losses resulting from valuation changes in the investments of non-clo cip attributable to the interests of third parties are offset by resulting changes in gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities and therefore do not have a material effect on the financial condition, operating results (including earnings per share), liquidity or capital resources of the company's common shareholders. similarly, any gains or losses resulting from valuation changes in the investments of clos attributable to the interests of third parties are offset by the calculated value of the notes issued by the clos (offsetting in other gains/(losses) of cip) and therefore also do not have a material effect on the financial condition, operating results (including earnings per share), liquidity or capital resources of the company's common shareholders.
additionally, cip represent less than 1% of the company's aum. therefore, the net gains or losses of cip are not indicative of the performance of the company's aggregate assets under management.
income before taxes total income before taxes includes income/losses of cip; however, the company's operating revenues earned from cip are not included in operating revenues under u.s. gaap, as such operating revenues are eliminated upon consolidation. therefore, total u.s. and foreign income before taxes in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, note 15, "taxation,", which includes income/losses from cip, and u.s. and foreign operating revenues in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data, note 17, "geographic information.," in which cip has been eliminated, may not correlate. the table included in the taxation footnote is formatted such that the income of cip is separately stated so that the impact of cip is evident.
total u.s. income before taxes increased $98.6 million during the year ended december 31, 2017 to $638.5 million from $539.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 and includes u.s. income of cip of $0.1 million (december 31, 2016: $2.4 million). u.s. income from cip decreased $2.3 million (95.8%) from 2016 due primarily to the impact of gains on consolidated private equity partnerships. excluding cip, u.s. income before taxes in 2017 increased $100.9 million (18.8%) from december 31, 2016 due to a larger increase in u.s. operating revenues than operating expenses.
total foreign income before taxes increased $124.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2017 to $790.7 million from $666.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 and includes foreign income of cip of $35.9 million (december 31, 2016: foreign income of cip of $14.7 million). foreign income from cip increased $21.2 million due primarily to gains on consolidated funds and the impact of newly consolidated funds in 2017. excluding cip, foreign income increased by $102.8 million (15.8%) from 2016 due to a larger increase in foreign operating revenues and other income than operating expenses.
total u.s. income before taxes decreased $148.0 million to $539.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 from $687.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2015 and includes income of cip of $2.4 million (december 31, 2015: $26.0 million). u.s. income of cip decreased $23.6 million (90.8%) from 2015 due primarily to the impact of private equity partnerships that were deconsolidated upon the adoption of asu 2015-02. excluding cip, u.s. income before taxes in 2016 decreased $124.4 million (18.8%) from december 31, 2015 due to a larger decrease in u.s. operating revenues than operating expenses.
total foreign income before taxes decreased $7.5 million to $666.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 from $674.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2015 and includes u.s. income of cip of $14.7 million (december 31, 2015: losses of cip of $72.1 million). excluding cip, foreign income decreased by $94.3 million (12.6%) from 2015 due to a larger decrease in foreign operating revenues and other income than operating expenses.

income tax expense our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2017 decreased to 18.8% (year ended december 31, 2016: 28.0%). the decrease included a $130.7 million tax benefit (9.3%) related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities following the 2017 tax act enacted in the united states. the inclusion of income from non-controlling interests decreased our rate period-over-period by 0.2% (0.5% decrease to the effective tax rate in 2017 and 0.3% decrease to the effective tax rate in 2016). the remainder of the rate movement was primarily due to changes in the mix of pre-tax income. see also item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - in note 15, "taxation," for further details and additional discussion on estimated amounts recorded as of december 31, 2017 for the 2017 tax act.
our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2016 decreased to 28.0% (year ended december 31, 2015: 29.2%). the inclusion of non-controlling interests decreased our effective tax rate period-over-period by 0.4%. (0.3% decrease to the effective tax rate in 2016 and 0.1% increase to the effective tax rate in 2015). 2016 included a 0.4% rate increase as a result of the non-cash impairment charge related to the 49% investment in invesco asset management (india) private limited. 2015 included a 0.2% rate increase as a result of tax legislation changes in new york city net of settlements, a 0.2% increase as a result of regulatory investigation charges and a 0.3% increase relating to unrecognized tax benefits. the remainder of the rate movement was primarily due to changes in the mix of pre-tax income.
schedule of non-gaap information we utilize the following non-gaap performance measures: net revenue (and by calculation, net revenue yield on aum), adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd. and adjusted diluted earnings per share (eps). the company believes the adjusted measures provide valuable insight into the company's ongoing operational performance and assist in comparisons to its competitors. these measures also assist the company's management with the establishment of operational budgets and forecasts and assist the board of directors and management of the company in determining incentive compensation decisions. the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measures are operating revenues (and by calculation, gross revenue yield on aum), operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to invesco ltd. and diluted eps. each of these measures is discussed more fully below.
the following are reconciliations of operating revenues, operating income (and by calculation, operating margin), and net income attributable to invesco ltd. (and by calculation, diluted eps) on a u.s. gaap basis to a non-gaap basis of net revenues, adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin), and adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd. (and by calculation, adjusted diluted eps). these non-gaap measures should not be considered as substitutes for any u.s. gaap measures and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. additional reconciling items may be added in the future to these non-gaap measures if deemed appropriate. the tax effects related to the reconciling items have been calculated based on the tax rate attributable to the jurisdiction to which the transaction relates. notes to the reconciliations follow the tables.

(1)   proportional share of net revenues and operating income from joint venture investments the company has two joint venture investments in china. the invesco great wall joint venture is one of the largest sino-foreign managers of equity products in china, with aum of approximately $17.4 billion as of december 31, 2017. the company has a 49% interest in invesco great wall. the company also has a 50% joint venture with huaneng capital services to access private equity investment opportunities in power generation in china through huaneng invesco wlr investment consulting company ltd. enhancing our operations in china is one effort that we believe could improve our competitive position over time. accordingly, we believe that it is appropriate to evaluate the contribution of these joint venture investments to the operations of the business.
management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues, net of distribution expenses, from our chinese joint venture investments in the computation of net revenues and the addition of our proportional share of operating income in the related computations of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin also provide useful information to investors and other users of the company's consolidated financial statements, as management considers it appropriate to evaluate the contribution of its joint ventures to the operations of the business. it is also consistent with the presentation
56
of aum and net flows (where our proportional share of the ending balances and related activity are reflected) and therefore provides a more meaningful calculation of net revenue yield on aum.
(2)   third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses include renewal commissions, management fee rebates and distribution costs (12b-1 and marketing support) paid to brokers and independent financial advisors and other service and administrative fees paid to third parties. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 1, "accounting policies - revenue recognition" for additional details. while the terms used for these types of expenses vary by geography, they are all expense items that are closely linked to the value of aum and the revenue earned by invesco from aum; although, from time-to-time, distribution expenses may include commissions paid in connection with the launch of closed-end funds for which there is no corresponding revenue in the period. since the company has been deemed to be the principal in the third-party arrangements, the company must reflect these expenses gross of operating revenues under u.s. gaap.
management believes that the deduction of third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses from operating revenues appropriately reflects the nature of these expenses as being passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of, and distribute, the company's managed funds. further, these expenses vary extensively by geography due to the differences in distribution channels. the net presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the business, removing distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and allowing for a fair comparison with u.s. peer investment managers and within invesco's own investment units. additionally, management evaluates net revenue yield on aum, which is equal to net revenues divided by average aum during the reporting period. this financial measure is an indicator of the basis point net revenues we receive for each dollar of aum we manage and is useful when evaluating the company's performance relative to industry competitors and within the company for capital allocation purposes.
(3)   cip see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, note 19 - "consolidated investment products" for a detailed analysis of the impact to the company's consolidated financial statements from the consolidation of cip. the reconciling items add back the management and performance fees earned by invesco from the consolidated products and remove the revenues and expenses recorded by the consolidated products that have been included in the u.s. gaap consolidated statements of income.
management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader's analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. accordingly, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues, operating income and net income for the impact of cip in calculating the respective net revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted net income.

(4)   business combination related adjustments business combination related adjustments are comprised of amounts incurred by the company in connection with business combinations. management believes it is useful to investors and other users of our consolidated financial statements to adjust for the transaction and integration charges, the reversal of business combination-related deferred tax liabilities recorded under u.s. gaap, currency gains recognized on revaluation of foreign currencies held in anticipation of payment for acquisition and other acquisition/disposition related adjustments in arriving at adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted eps, as this will aid comparability of our results period to period, and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisition and disposition related income or charges.

____________
a.   employee compensation expenses of $5.8 million incurred in 2017 are related to our european etf acquisition, while $7.0 million incurred in 2016 are associated with the acquisition of jemstep, a market-leading provider of advisor-focused digital solutions. expenses in 2013 are related to employee severance expenses associated with the cessation of activities from a previous acquisition.
b.   transaction and integration expenses reflect the legal, regulatory, advisory, valuation, integration-related employee incentive awards, other professional or consulting fees and general and administrative costs, which includes travel costs related to transactions and the costs of temporary staff involved in executing the transaction, and the post-closing costs of integrating the acquired business into the company's existing operations, including incremental costs associated with achieving synergy savings.
c.   intangible amortization expense is associated with intangible assets that are identified from acquisition of a business and are amortized on a straight-line basis over useful lives. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, note 5 - "intangible assets" for detail.
d.   during 2015, the company acquired investment management contracts from deutsche bank and the purchase price was solely comprised of contingent consideration payable in future periods. adjustment to the fair value of contingent consideration liability is a decrease of $7.6 million in 2017, an increase of $7.4 million in 2016 and a decrease of $27.1 million in 2015. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, note 2 - "fair value of assets and liabilities" for detail.
e.   other gains and losses for 2017 includes a realized gain of $12.1 million related to revaluation of euros held in the u.k. in anticipation of payment for the european etf business acquisition.
f.   other-than-temporary impairment includes an impairment charge of $17.8 million in 2016 that is related to the acquisition of invesco asset management (india) private limited.
g.   while finite-lived intangible assets are amortized under u.s. gaap, there is no amortization charge on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. in certain qualifying situations, these can be amortized for tax purposes, generally over a 15-year period, as is the case in the u.s. these deferred tax liabilities represent tax benefits that are not included in the consolidated statements of income absent an impairment charge or the disposal of the related business. the company receives these tax benefits but does not anticipate a sale or impairment of these assets in the foreseeable
58
future, and therefore the deferred tax liabilities recognized under u.s. gaap are not expected to be used either through a credit in the consolidated statements of income or through settlement of tax obligations.
h.   the results of the discontinued operations of atlantic trust have been excluded in arriving at adjusted net income attributable to invesco ltd., which is the basis of calculating adjusted diluted eps. accordingly, the company's non-gaap financial measures reflect only the continuing business of invesco.
(5)   market movement on deferred compensation plan liabilities certain deferred compensation plan awards are linked to the appreciation (depreciation) of specified investments, typically managed by the company. invesco hedges economically the exposure to market movements by holding these investments on its balance sheet and through a total return swap financial instrument. u.s. gaap requires the appreciation (depreciation) in the compensation liability to be expensed over the award vesting period in proportion to the vested amount of the award as part of compensation expense. the full value of the investment and financial instrument appreciation (depreciation) are immediately recorded below operating income in other gains and losses. this creates a timing difference between the recognition of the compensation expense and the investment gain or loss impacting net income attributable to invesco ltd. and diluted eps which will reverse over the life of the award and net to zero at the end of the multi-year vesting period. during periods of high market volatility these timing differences impact compensation expense, operating income and operating margin in a manner which, over the life of the award, will ultimately be offset by gains and losses recorded below operating income on the consolidated statements of income. the non-gaap measures exclude the mismatch created by differing u.s. gaap treatments of the market movement on the liability and the investments.
since these plans are hedged economically, management believes it is useful to reflect the offset ultimately achieved from hedging the investment market exposure in the calculation of adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin) and adjusted net income (and by calculation, adjusted diluted eps), to produce results that will be more comparable period to period. the related fund shares will have been purchased on or around the date of grant, eliminating any ultimate cash impact from market movements that occur over the vesting period.
additionally, dividend income from investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans is recorded as dividend income and as compensation expense on the company's consolidated statements of income on the record dates. this dividend income is passed through to the employee participants in the plan and is not retained by the company. the non-gaap measures exclude this dividend income and related compensation expense.

____________
a.   during the year ended december 31, 2013, the company reduced a management fee revenue accrual by $4.3 million to reflect a multi-year true-up. inclusion of this true-up in the company's non-gaap financial information would depress the derived metric of net revenue yield on aum from continuing operations, an important metric calculated
60
from a non-gaap financial measure which is often contemplated by users of the company's financial information to evaluate the company with industry peers.  the true-up is not indicative of a trend in future net revenue yield on aum; therefore, it is not included in management's evaluation of the results of the business.  on this basis, the amount is added back to management fees to arrive at net revenue.
b.   european infrastructure transformational initiative: the company outsourced its european transfer agency and made certain structural changes to product and distribution platforms. expenses incurred related to the european infrastructure activities are excluded in arriving at the non-gaap financial information. in connection with the initiative, operational process changes resulted in an accounting adjustment recognizing additional distribution expense in the year ended and december 31, 2013.
c.   business optimization: operating expenses for 2017 include costs associated with a business transformation initiative that include severance costs of $30.0 million, and consulting and temporary labor costs of $25.3 million (2016 : $26.4 million and $21.8 million, 2015: $12.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively).
a separate business optimization location strategy initiative incurred property related charges and/or credits of the following: 2014: charges of $33.1 million associated with vacating leased properties and severance costs of $7.2 million related to the initiative; 2015: property related charges of $2.0 million and lease credit of $6.4 million; 2016: property related charges of $1.7 million and lease credit of $3.2 million; and 2017: property related charges of $2.7 million.
d.   employee benefit plan termination: operating expenses for 2016 include an incremental credit of $8.6 million related to an employee benefit plan termination.
e.   general and administrative expenses for 2015 include a provision of $12.6 million pertaining to regulatory actions and related legal fees of $0.5 million (2017: none; 2016 :$1.0 million). this includes $7.6 million associated with our private equity business.
operating expenses for 2014 include a charge of $31.1 million (in respect of the penalty under a settlement of an enforcement proceeding reached with the u.k. financial conduct authority (fca) pertaining to the company's compliance with certain fca rules and regulations for the period from may 2008 to november 2012). this charge, together with settlement-related legal costs of $0.5 million, has been recorded in general and administrative expense.
f.   operating expenses for 2017 reflect the cost of multiple senior executive retirements, including, among others, the former senior managing director of emea and the chairman of our private equity business, which resulted in expenses of $19.7 million related to accelerated vesting of deferred compensation and other separation costs. the number of senior executive retirements and magnitude of their retirement costs incurred in one quarter was unprecedented for invesco. the company deemed it appropriate to adjust these costs from u.s. gaap total compensation expenses in an effort to isolate and evaluate our level of ongoing compensation expenses and to allow for more appropriate comparisons to internal metrics and with the level of compensation expenses incurred by industry peers.
g.   general and administrative expenses for 2014 and 2015 include charges of $31.1 million and $4.7 million, respectively, in respect of a multi-year fund reimbursement expense associated with historical private equity management fees. the charge resulted primarily from using a more appropriate methodology regarding the calculation of offsets to management fees.
h.   included within general and administrative expenses for 2014 is a credit of $4.7 million related to the partial refund of a $15.3 million levy in 2010 from the u.k. financial services compensation scheme. an additional $3.0 million charge was recorded in the year ended december 31, 2013 reflecting revised estimates of the levy.
i.   property, office and technology expenses includes a charge of $11.7 million in the year ended december 31, 2013 related to the write-off of capitalized it software development costs.
j.   included within other gains and losses, net is the mark-to-market of foreign exchange put option contracts intended to provide protection against the impact of a significant decline in the pound sterling/u.s. dollar and the euro/u.s. dollar foreign exchange rates. the pound sterling contracts provide coverage through december 31, 2018 and the euro contracts provided coverage through december 27, 2017. the adjustment from u.s. gaap to non-gaap earnings removes the impact of market volatility; therefore, the company's non-gaap results include only the amortization of the cost of the contracts during the contract period.
61
k.   on december 31, 2013, at the time of creating a new trust company subsidiary to continue operating the company's institutional trust activities immediately following the disposition of atlantic trust, the company made a $31.9 million payment to a managed investment trust, which resulted in the subsequent termination of an outstanding support agreement. this expense was recorded in other gains/(losses) in the company's consolidated statement of income during the year ended december 31, 2013.
l.   the income tax provision for 2017 includes a retroactive state tax expense of $12.2 million related to 2016 and prior open tax years caused by changes in state tax regulations. 2017 also included a $130.7 million tax benefit as a result of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities following the 2017 tax act enacted in the united states.

balance sheet discussion cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents increased by $678.4 million from $1,328.0 million at december 31, 2016 to $2,006.4 million at december 31, 2017. see "cash flows discussion" in the following section within this management's discussion and analysis for additional discussion regarding the movements in cash flows during the periods. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 1, "accounting policies - cash and cash equivalents," regarding requirements to retain liquid resources in certain jurisdictions.
unsettled fund receivables and payables unsettled fund receivables increased by $120.9 million from $672.9 million at december 31, 2016 to $793.8 million at december 31, 2017, due primarily to higher transaction activity between funds and investors in late december 2017 when compared to late december 2016 in our u.k. and cross-border funds, offset by lower uit activity. in our u.k. and cross-border operations, unsettled fund receivables are created by the normal settlement periods on transactions initiated by certain clients. in the company's capacity as sponsor of uits, the company records receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations for unsettled sell trades of securities and uits in addition to receivables from customers for unsettled sell trades of uits. the presentation of the unsettled fund receivables and substantially offsetting payables ($783.8 million at december 31, 2017 up from $659.3 million at december 31, 2016) at trade date reflects the legal relationship between the underlying investor and the company.
investments as of december 31, 2017 we had $674.6 million in investments (december 31, 2016: $795.3 million). included in investments are $243.0 million of seed money investments in affiliated funds used to seed funds as we launch new products, and $92.3 million of investments related to assets held for deferred compensation plans, which are also held primarily in affiliated funds. seed investments decreased by $6.8 million during the year ended december 31, 2017. the decrease in the period reflects redemptions of $172.3 million, partially offset by purchases of $58.0 million, a non-cash increase of $80.9 million due to the deconsolidation of certain cip in the period (restoring the company's formerly eliminated investment balances) as well as an increase of $24.3 million driven by market valuation changes and foreign exchange movements. investments related to deferred compensation awards decreased by a net $78.2 million during the period, primarily related to the disposition of certain investments held to hedge economically one of the company's deferred compensation plans. such disposition occurred in conjunction with the entrance by the company into a one-year renewable total return swap to more efficiently hedge this deferred compensation plan. this transaction did not have a material impact to the company's operations or financial position.
included in investments are $277.3 million in equity method investments in our chinese joint ventures and in certain of the company's private equity partnerships, real estate partnerships and other co-investments (december 31, 2016: $279.0 million). the decrease of $1.7 million in equity method investments was driven by capital returns and the consolidation of certain investments during the current period. this decreases were partially offset by current period earnings, capital calls into certain partnership investments and increases due to the changes in foreign exchange rates.
assets held for policyholders and policyholder payables one of our subsidiaries, invesco perpetual life limited, is an insurance company that was established to facilitate retirement savings plans in the u.k. the entity holds assets that are managed for its clients on its balance sheet with an equal and offsetting liability. the increase in the balance of these accounts from $8,224.2 million at december 31, 2016, to $12,444.5 million at december 31, 2017, was the result of new business net inflows of $3,209.5 million and an increase in the market values of these assets and liabilities of $51.1 million and foreign exchange movements of $959.7 million. the new business inflows can be primarily attributed to pension and retirement funds investing into multi-asset products via this insurance company.
intangible assets, net intangible assets reflect a net increase of $159.3 million from $1,399.4 million at december 31, 2016, to $1,558.7 million at december 31, 2017. the increase includes $167.1 million related to the acquisition of the european etf business, foreign exchange movements of $9.6 million, offset by amortization of $17.4 million.
63
goodwill goodwill increased from $6,129.2 million at december 31, 2016, to $6,590.7 million at december 31, 2017. the increase consists of $193.3 million related to the acquisition of the european etf business and foreign exchange movements of $268.2 million. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 6, "goodwill," for an analysis of the change in goodwill balances between periods. the company's annual goodwill impairment review is performed as of october 1 of each year. as a result of that analysis, the company determined that no impairment existed at that date. see "critical accounting policies - goodwill" for additional details of the company's goodwill impairment analysis process.
long-term debt long-term debt decreased from $2,102.4 million at december 31, 2016, to $2,075.8 million at december 31, 2017, a decrease of $26.6 million. as of december 31, 2017, there was zero outstanding on the credit facility (at december 31, 2016: $28.7 million).
liquidity and capital resources our capital structure, together with available cash balances, cash flows generated from operations, existing capacity under our credit facility and further capital market activities, if necessary, should provide us with sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs, including operating, debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements. material changes in the company's capital structure over the last three years include:
2017: during 2017, invesco entered into a definitive agreement to acquire guggenheim investments' etf business. the acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018 for an anticipated purchase price of $1.2 billion. the company expects approximately 80% of the purchase price will be funded through the use of the company's existing credit facility with the remainder paid in cash. the company plans to repay the amount borrowed over the course of 2018, returning leverage ratios to pre-acquisition levels, through the curtailment of open market share repurchases. as such, the company has not repurchased common shares in the open market during 2017. separately, on august 11, 2017 the company amended and restated the existing credit facility agreement increasing the borrowing limit to $1.5 billion and extending the expiration date to august 11, 2022.
on december 22, 2017, the 2017 tax act, was signed into law. the 2017 tax act, among other items, reduces the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018. our intention is to use the additional cash flow generated from the lower tax rate first to reduce the anticipated future outstanding balance on the credit facility resulting from the guggenheim acquisition. after the acquisition is complete and the credit facility balance is reduced, any residual excess will follow our capital management priorities.
2016: during 2016, we repurchased 18.1 million common shares in open market transactions utilizing $535.0 million in cash under the company's board-approved open market share repurchase program.
2015: during 2015, we repurchased 15.5 million common shares in open market transactions utilizing $548.8 million in cash under the company's board-approved open market share repurchase program. on october 14, 2015, the company completed the issuance of senior notes with aggregate principal amounts of $500 million at 3.750% due january 15, 2026. the proceeds were used, in part, to repay the outstanding balance on the credit facility at that date. separately, on august 7, 2015, the company amended the existing $1.25 billion credit facility to extend its maturity to august 7, 2020.
our capital management priorities have evolved with the growth and success of our business and include:
•   reinvestment in the business;
•   moderate annual growth of dividends (as further discussed in the "dividends" section below);
•   share repurchase; and
•   target an approximate $1 billion cash buffer in excess of european regulatory and liquidity requirements.
these priorities are executed in a manner consistent with our desire to maintain a strong, investment-grade credit rating. as of the filing of this report, invesco held credit ratings of a2/stable, a/negative and a-/stable from moody's, s&p, and fitch ratings fitch, respectively. our ability to continue to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors, including our credit ratings, the condition of the global economy, investors' willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates,
64
credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner, our business could be adversely impacted. see also item 1a - "risk factors," for more detailed discussion on reliance on credit ratings.
certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital. such requirements may change from time-to-time as additional guidance is released based on a variety of factors, including balance sheet composition, assessment of risk exposures and governance, and review from regulators. these and other similar provisions of applicable laws and regulations may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital, repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities. all of our regulated eu subsidiaries are subject to consolidated capital requirements under eu directives, including those arising from the eu's capital requirements directive and the u.k.'s internal capital adequacy assessment process (icaap), and capital is maintained within this sub-group to satisfy these regulations. we meet these requirements in part by holding cash and cash equivalents. this retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the european sub-group in the countries where it is located. due to the capital restrictions, the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited. in addition, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences. we are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. as of december 31, 2017, the company's minimum regulatory capital requirement was $761.4 million (december 31, 2016: $590.8 million); the increase was driven primarily by the european etf business acquisition as well the strengthening of the pound sterling against the u.s. dollar. the total amount of non-u.s. cash and cash equivalents was $1,595.6 million at december 31, 2017 (december 31, 2016: $1,168.4 million).
in addition, the company is required to hold cash deposits with clearing organizations or to otherwise segregate cash to maintain compliance with federal and other regulations in connection with its uit broker dealer entity. at december 31, 2017, these cash deposits totaled $11.4 million (december 31, 2016: $11.4 million).
the consolidation of $6.3 billion and $4.8 billion of total assets and long-term debt of cip as of december 31, 2017, respectively, did not impact the company's liquidity and capital resources. the majority of cip balances related to consolidated clos.the collateral assets of the clos are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the clos. the company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the clos, beyond the company's direct investments in, and management and performance fees generated from, these products, which are eliminated upon consolidation. if the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. likewise, if the clos were to liquidate, their investors would have no recourse to the general credit of the company. the company therefore does not consider this debt to be an obligation of the company. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 19, "consolidated investment products," for additional details.
cash flows discussion the ability to consistently generate free cash flow from operations in excess of dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures, and ongoing operating expenses is one of our company's fundamental financial strengths. operations continue to be financed from current earnings and borrowings. our principal uses of cash, other than for operating expenses, include dividend payments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, purchase of our shares in the open market and investments in certain new investment products.
cash flows of cip (discussed in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 19, "consolidated investment products") are reflected in invesco's cash provided by or used in operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. cash held by cip is not available for general use by invesco, nor is invesco cash available for general use by its cip. accordingly, the table below presents the consolidated total cash flows of the company and separately presents the impact to the cash flows from cip. the impact is illustrated in the tables immediately below by a column which shows the dollar-value change in the consolidated figures, as caused by the consolidation of cip. for example, the impact of cip on net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2017 reflects cash used of $61.2 million; however, this was not used as part of the company's corporate cash activities. excluding the impact of cip, cash provided by operations was $1,431.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2017.
also as illustrated in the table below, the sum of the operating, investing and financing cash flows of cip offsets to a zero impact to the company's change in cash and cash equivalent balances from period to period. the cash flows of cip do not form part of the company's cash flow management processes, nor do they form part of the company's significant liquidity evaluations and decisions for the reasons noted. the discussion that follows the table focuses on the company's cash flows.

**   ebitda and adjusted debt are non-gaap financial measures; however management does not use these measures for anything other than these debt covenant calculations. the calculation of ebitda above (a reconciliation from net income attributable to invesco ltd.) is defined by our credit agreement, and therefore net income attributable to invesco ltd. is the most appropriate gaap measure from which to reconcile to ebitda. the calculation of adjusted debt is defined in our credit facility and equals total debt of $2,075.8 million plus $10.6 million in letters of credit.
the discussion that follows identifies risks associated with the company's liquidity and capital resources. the item 1. business -- risk management section contains a broader discussion of the company's overall approach to risk management.
credit and liquidity risk capital management involves the management of the company's liquidity and cash flows. the company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit, liquidity and market risks, such as interest rate and foreign currency risks (as discussed in item 7a, "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk"), through measurement and analysis. the company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits, which are held by external firms. the company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products, as well as with external high credit-quality financial institutions. these arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk.
credit risk credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to meet an obligation. all cash and cash equivalent balances are subject to credit risk, as they represent deposits made by the company with external banks and other institutions. as of december 31, 2017, our maximum exposure to credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalent balances is $2,006.4 million. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 20, "related parties," for information regarding cash and cash equivalents invested in affiliated money market funds.
the company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk. the company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations.
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities as the same become due. the company is exposed to liquidity risk through its $2,075.8 million in total debt. the company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods, reviewing them regularly with senior management, maintaining a committed credit facility, scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialogue.
effects of inflation inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways. first, inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure, especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted. to the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment, our profitability could be negatively impacted. secondly, the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment. declines in the values of these aum could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of aum.

____________
(1)   long-term debt includes $2,075.8 million of fixed rate debt. fixed interest payments are reflected in the table above in the periods they are due, and include any issuance discounts. the table above includes the company's debt; debt of cip is excluded from the table above, as the company is not obligated for these amounts. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 19, "consolidated investment products," for additional information.
(2)   operating leases reflect obligations for leased building space and other assets. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 13, "operating leases" for sublease information.
(3)   in the ordinary course of business, invesco enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of invesco. purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent fixed-price contracts, which are either non-cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. at december 31, 2017, the company's obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data, office-related services and third-party marketing and promotional services. in addition, the company is a party to certain variable-price contractual arrangements (e.g. contingent future payments based on aum levels, number of accounts, transaction volume, etc.) for which the company is reimbursed by affiliated funds and as such are not included in the table above. purchase obligations are recorded as liabilities in the company's consolidated financial statements when services are provided. purchase obligations also include contingent consideration liabilities.
(4)   the company has capital commitments into co-invested funds that are to be drawn down over the life of the partnership as investment opportunities are identified. at december 31, 2017, the company's undrawn capital and purchase commitments were $292.8 million. these are not included in the above table. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 18, "commitments and contingencies" for additional details.
(5)   due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with unrecognized tax benefits at december 31, 2017, the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. therefore, $19.6 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, note 15 - "taxation" for a discussion regarding income taxes.
(6)   in addition to the contractual obligations in the table above, we periodically make contributions to defined benefit pension plans. for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 we contributed $11.8 million and $14.2 million, respectively, to these plans. in 2018, we expect to contribute $24.5 million to our defined benefit pension plans. see item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 12, "retirement benefit plans" for detailed benefit pension plan information. the company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above.

critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are disclosed in item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - note 1, "accounting policies." the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made. these accounting policies and estimates are discussed below; however, the additional accounting policy detail in the footnote previously referenced is important to the discussion of each of the topics. different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these consolidated financial statements, and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from period-to-period in the future.
taxation we operate in several countries and several states and other taxing jurisdictions through our various subsidiaries, and must allocate our income, expenses, and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions. accordingly, our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations. annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions within each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities. each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations. because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates, it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our consolidated financial statements. as a result, it is likely that additions to, or reductions of, income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled.
deferred tax assets, net of any associated valuation allowance, have been recognized based on management's belief that taxable income of the appropriate character, more likely than not, will be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time. in the event that actual results differ from our expectations, or if our historical trends of positive operating income changes, we may be required to record a valuation allowance on some or all of these deferred tax assets, which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations. in assessing whether a valuation allowance should be established against a deferred income tax asset, the company considers the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, among other factors.
the company utilizes a specific recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the consolidated financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. the prescribed two-step process for evaluating a tax position involves first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities. if it is, the second step then requires a company to measure this tax position benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. the company recognizes any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the consolidated statements of income as components of income tax expense.
the company recognized a provisional income tax benefit of $130.7 million which is included as a component of the provision for income taxes related to the 2017 tax act. see also item 8, financial statements and supplementary data - in note 15, "taxation," for further details and additional discussion on estimated amounts recorded as of december 31, 2017 for the 2017 tax act.
goodwill our goodwill impairment testing conducted during 2017 and 2016 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, indicating that step two of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary; however, the company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled $6,590.7 million and $6,129.2 million at december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, respectively. such events include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on the company's aum, or any other material negative change in aum and related management fees.
the october 1, 2017 annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a consistent methodology to that used for the 2016 annual impairment test. fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount. the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment, including aum growth rates, product mix, effective fee rates, pre-tax profit margins, effective tax rates and discount rates. the 2017 annual goodwill impairment test includes assumptions updated for current market conditions, including the company's updated forecasts for changes in aum due to market gains and long-term net flows and the corresponding changes in revenue and expenses. market gains are based upon historical returns of the s&p 500 index, treasury bond returns and treasury bill returns, as applicable to the company's aum mix on the testing date. the most sensitive of these assumptions are the estimated cash flows and the use of a weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate to determine present value. the most significant
72
change in assumptions from 2016 related to a change in cost of equity, which resulted in a discount rate of 11.68% for the october 1, 2017 analysis (2016: 13.0%).
the discount rates used are estimates of the weighted average cost of capital for the investment management sector reflecting the overall industry risks associated with future cash flows and have been calculated consistently from period to period. while the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate, changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different goodwill impairment assessments.
intangible assets where evidence exists that the underlying arrangements have a high likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost to the company, the intangible asset is assigned an indefinite life and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable (i.e. the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset). in addition, management's judgment is required to estimate the period over which definite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the company's cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a definite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the company's amortization expense, which was $17.4 million, $13.9 million and $10.6 million for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount. if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. fair value is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount. the income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment, including aum growth rates, product mix, effective fee rates, pre-tax profit margins, effective tax rates and discount rates. the most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of the estimated fair value are the aum growth rate and discount rate, which is a weighted average cost of capital including consideration of company size premiums. changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different impairment conclusions. in 2017 and 2016, annual impairment reviews of indefinite-lived intangible assets determined that no impairment existed at the respective review dates, the classifications of indefinite-lived and definite-lived remain appropriate, and no changes to the expected lives of the definite-lived intangible assets were required.
investments a significant portion of our investments are carried at fair value on our balance sheet with the periodic mark-to-market recorded either in accumulated other comprehensive income in the case of available-for-sale investments, or directly to earnings, in the case of trading assets. since assumptions are made in determining the fair values of investments for which active markets do not exist, the actual value that may be realized upon the sale or other disposition of these investments could differ from the current carrying values. fair value calculations are also required in association with our quarterly impairment testing of investments. the accuracy of our other-than-temporary impairment assessments is dependent upon the extent to which we are able to accurately determine fair values. seed money investments are held in invesco managed funds with the purpose of providing capital to the funds during their development periods. these investments are recorded at fair value using quoted market prices in active markets; there is no modeling or additional information needed to arrive at the fair values of these investments.
the value of investments may decline for various reasons. the market price may be affected by general market conditions which reflect prospects for the economy as a whole or by specific information pertaining to an industry or individual company. such declines require further investigation by management, which considers all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of the investment, including, but not limited to, the following factors:
•   the probability that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a debt security not impaired at acquisition;
•   the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost;
•   the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer;
•   the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value;
•   the decline in the security's value due to an increase in market interest rates or a change in foreign exchange rates since acquisition;
•   determination that the security is not realizable; or
73
•   an adverse change in estimated cash flows of a beneficial interest.
our other-than-temporary impairment analysis of available for sale seed money holdings includes a review of the market returns required for each fund portfolio to enable us to recover our original investment. as part of the review, we analyze the absolute amount of any loss to date, the trend of the losses, and percent declines in values of the seed money investments. along with intent and ability to hold, all of these scenarios are considered as part of our other-than-temporary impairment analysis of seed money holdings.
we also assess our equity method and other investments for impairment. if circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, a more detailed impairment analysis is performed which includes assessing many of the factors listed above.
cip assessing if an entity is a variable interest entity (vie) or voting interest entity (voe) involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. factors included in this assessment include the legal organization of the entity, the company's contractual involvement with the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the company's involvement with the entity. a vie, in the context of the company and its managed funds, is a fund that does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support, or a fund for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests. if the company is deemed to have the power to direct the activities of the fund that most significantly impact the fund's economic performance, and the obligation to absorb losses/right to receive benefits from the fund that could potentially be significant to the fund, then the company is deemed to be the fund's primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the fund.
determining if the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie also requires significant judgment judgment involved to assess if the company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the fund's economic results and to assess if the company's interests could be deemed significant. if current financial statements are not available for consolidated vies or voes, estimation of investment valuation is required, which includes assessing available quantitative and qualitative data. significant changes in these estimates could impact the reported value of the investments held by cip and the related offsetting equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the consolidated balance sheets and the other gains and losses of cip, net, and related offsetting gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, net, amounts on the consolidated statements of income.
as of december 31, 2017, the company consolidated vies that held investments of $5,658.0 million (december 31, 2016: $5,066.3 million). as of december 31, 2016 the company consolidated voes that held fund investments of $49.8 million. as circumstances supporting estimates and factors change, the determination of vie and primary beneficiary status may change, as could the determination of the necessity of consolidation of voes. estimation is involved when determining investment and debt valuation for certain cip; however, changes in the fair values of these amounts are largely offset by noncontrolling interests.
contingencies contingencies arise when we have a present obligation as a result of a past event that is both probable and reasonably estimable. we must from time to time make material estimates with respect to legal and other contingencies. the nature of our business requires compliance with various laws and regulations, as well as various contractual obligations, and exposes us to a variety of legal proceedings and matters in the ordinary course of business. while the outcomes of matters such as these are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict, we maintain reserves reflected in accounts payable and accrued expenses, as appropriate, for identified losses that are, in our judgment, probable and reasonably estimable. we expense any related legal fees as they are incurred. management's judgment is based on the advice of legal counsel, ruling on various motions by the applicable court, review of the outcome of similar matters, if applicable, and review of guidance from governmental and other regulatory authorities, if applicable. contingent consideration payable in relation to a business acquisition is recorded as of the acquisition date as part of the fair value transferred in exchange for the acquired business.

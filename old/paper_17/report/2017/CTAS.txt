item 1a.  risk factors the statements in this section describe the most significant risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operation and the trading price of our debt or equity securities.
in addition, this section sets forth statements which constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking statements. the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements.  forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as "estimates," "anticipates," "predicts," "projects," "plans," "expects," "intends," "target," "forecast," "believes," "seeks," "could," "should," "may" and "will" or the negative versions thereof and similar words, terms and expressions and by the context in which they are used.  such statements are based upon current expectations of cintas and speak only as of the date made.  you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement.  we cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized.  these statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties, potentially inaccurate assumptions and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in or implied by this annual report. factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, risks inherent with the g&k transaction in the achievement of cost synergies and the timing thereof, including whether the g&k transaction will be accretive and within the expected timeframe; the possibility of greater than anticipated operating costs including energy and fuel costs; lower sales volumes; loss of customers due to outsourcing trends; the performance and costs of integration of acquisitions, including g&k; fluctuations in costs of materials and labor including increased medical costs; costs and possible effects of union organizing activities; failure to comply with government regulations concerning employment discrimination, employee pay and benefits and employee health and safety; the effect on operations of exchange rate fluctuations, tariffs and other political, economic and regulatory risks; uncertainties regarding any existing or newly-discovered expenses and liabilities related to environmental compliance and remediation; the cost, results and ongoing assessment of internal controls for financial reporting required by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002; costs of our sap system implementation; disruptions caused by the inaccessibility of computer systems data, including cybersecurity risks; the initiation or outcome of litigation, investigations or other proceedings; higher assumed sourcing or distribution costs of products; the disruption of operations from catastrophic or extraordinary events; the amount and timing of repurchases of our common stock, if any; changes in federal and state tax and labor laws; and the reactions of competitors in terms of price and service. cintas undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any forward-looking statements or to otherwise update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information or to reflect events, circumstances or any other unanticipated developments arising after the date on which such statements are made, except otherwise as required by law. the risks and uncertainties described herein are not the only ones we may face. additional risks and uncertainties presently not known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also harm our business.
negative global economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance.
negative economic conditions, in north america and our other markets, may adversely affect our financial performance. higher levels of unemployment, inflation, tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could adversely affect the demand for cintas' products and services. increases in labor costs, including the cost to provide employee-partner related healthcare benefits, minimum wages, labor shortages or shortages of skilled labor, regulations regarding the classification of employees and/or their eligibility for overtime wages, higher material costs for items such as fabrics and textiles, the inability to obtain insurance coverage at cost-effective rates, higher interest rates, inflation, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws and other economic factors could increase our costs of rental uniforms and facility services, cost of other services and selling and administrative expenses. as a result, these factors could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations.
increased competition could adversely affect our financial performance.
we operate in highly competitive industries and compete with national, regional and local providers. product, design, price, quality, service and convenience to the customer are the competitive elements in these industries. if existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices, cintas may be required to lower prices, which would hurt its results of operations. cintas' competitors also generally compete with cintas for acquisition candidates, which can increase the price for acquisitions and reduce the number of available acquisition candidates. in addition, our customers and prospects may decide to perform certain services in-house instead of outsourcing these services to us. these competitive pressures could adversely affect our sales and consolidated results of operations.
5
an inability to open new, cost effective operating facilities may adversely affect our expansion efforts.
we plan to expand our presence in existing markets and enter new markets. the opening of new operating facilities is necessary to gain the capacity required for this expansion. our ability to open new operating facilities depends on our ability to identify attractive locations, negotiate leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms, identify and obtain adequate utility and water sources and comply with environmental regulations, zoning laws and other similar factors. any inability to effectively identify and manage these items may adversely affect our expansion efforts, and, consequently, adversely affect our financial performance.
risks associated with our acquisition practice could adversely affect our results of operations.
historically, a portion of our growth has come from acquisitions. we continue to evaluate opportunities for acquiring businesses that may supplement our internal growth. however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate and purchase suitable acquisitions. in addition, the success of any acquisition, including the ability to realize anticipated cost synergies, depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired company. the process of integrating acquired businesses, including g&k and zee, may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management's attention and our financial and other resources. if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, we may not be able to realize anticipated cost synergies resulting from acquisitions and our business could suffer. although we conduct due diligence investigations prior to each acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will discover or adequately protect against all material liabilities of an acquired business for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator. the failure to identify suitable acquisitions and successfully integrate these acquired businesses, or to discover liabilities associated with such businesses in the diligence process, could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.
our indebtedness may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business.
our outstanding indebtedness, including indebtedness incurred to consummate the g&k transaction, may have negative consequences on our business, such as requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend increases, stock buybacks and other general corporate purposes, as well as increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions. in addition, it may limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to enable us to react to changes in our business or industry or place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt.
changes in the fuel and energy industry could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
the price of fuel and energy needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for fuel and other energy related products, actions by energy producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries, regional production patterns, limits on refining capacities, natural disasters and environmental concerns. increases in fuel and energy costs could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.
failure to preserve positive labor relationships with our employees could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.
following the g&k transaction, more of our labor force is unionized. while we believe that our employee relations are good, we have been and could continue to be the target of a unionization campaign by several unions. these unions have attempted to pressure cintas into surrendering its employees' rights to a government-supervised election by unilaterally accepting union representation. we will continue to vigorously oppose any unionization campaign and defend our employees' rights to a government-supervised election. unionization campaigns could be materially disruptive to our business and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.
risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could adversely affect our results of operations.
the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. we require all of our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor and environmental laws, and otherwise be certified as meeting our required supplier standards of conduct. our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the united states. political and economic stability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located, the financial stability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet our supplier standards, labor problems experienced by our suppliers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost,
6
inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control. in addition, u.s. and foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
we earn revenue, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the u.s. dollar, including the canadian dollar, british pound, and the euro. in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, revenue denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar represented less than 10% of our consolidated revenue. because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, we must translate revenue, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into u.s. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. therefore, fluctuations in the value of the u.s. dollar against other major currencies, particularly in the event of significant increases in foreign currency revenue, will impact our revenue and operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. this impact could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.
failure to comply with federal and state regulations to which we are subject could result in penalties or costs that could adversely affect our results of operations.
our business is subject to complex and stringent state and federal regulations, including employment laws and regulations, minimum wage requirements, overtime requirements, working condition requirements, citizenship requirements, transportation and other laws and regulations.  in particular, we are subject to the regulations promulgated by the u.s. department of transportation, or usdot, and under the occupational safety and health act of 1970, as amended, or osha.  we have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with the usdot, osha and other laws and regulations to which we are subject.  changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations, including any laws or regulations that may be enacted by the current u.s. presidential administration and congress, may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business. the impact of new laws and regulations cannot be predicted. compliance with new laws and regulations may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures. any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines by government authorities, payment of damages to private litigants, or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations, which could adversely affect our ability to service customers and our consolidated results of operations.
we are subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
we are subject to various litigation claims and legal proceeding arising from the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. certain of these lawsuits or potential future lawsuits, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in liability and expense material to our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.
compliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs that adversely affect our results of operations.
our operating locations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing discharges of pollutants to the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the clean-up of contaminated sites. the operation of our businesses entails risks under environmental laws and regulations. we could incur significant costs, including clean-up costs, fines and sanctions and claims by third parties for property damage and personal injury, as a result of violations of or liabilities under these laws and regulations. we are currently involved in a limited number of remedial investigations and actions at various locations. while based on information currently known to us, we believe that we maintain adequate reserves with respect to these matters, our liability could exceed forecasted amounts, and the imposition of additional clean-up obligations or the discovery of additional contamination at these or other sites could result in significant additional costs which could adversely affect our results of operations. in addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with environmental laws and regulations, including requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future.
7
under applicable environmental laws, an owner or operator of real estate may be required to pay the costs of removing or remediating hazardous materials located on or emanating from property, whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials. while we regularly engage in environmental due diligence in connection with acquisitions, we can give no assurance that locations that have been acquired or leased have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations during prior periods or that future uses or conditions will not make us liable under these laws or expose us to third-party actions, including tort suits.
we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, maintain information and manage our businesses. disruptions in the availability of computer systems due to implementation of a new system or otherwise, or privacy breaches involving computer systems, could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales, results of operations and reputation and expose us to litigation risk.
our businesses rely on our computer systems to provide customer information, process customer transactions and provide other general information necessary to manage our businesses. we have an active disaster recovery plan in place that is frequently reviewed and tested. however, our computer systems, including the systems inherited from g&k, are subject to damage or interruption due to system conversions, such as our current conversion to sap enterprise system, power outages, computer or telecommunication failures, catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees. although we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technology-related and other potential disruptions, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays and interruptions in our ability to provide products and services to our customers. any disruption caused by the unavailability of our computer systems could adversely affect our sales, could require us to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and, therefore, could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations. in addition, cyber-security attacks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. if the network of security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems to address these threats to our technology fails, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected company, customer, or employee information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, or other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks could result in financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability and damage to our reputation.
failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our business and stock price.
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the consolidated financial statement preparation and presentation. while we continue to evaluate our internal controls, including those related to the acquired g&k business, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to discover material weaknesses in our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002. failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause us to be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud. this may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.
we may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining competent personnel in key positions.
we believe that a key component of our success is our corporate culture, which has been imparted by management throughout our corporate organization. this factor, along with our entire operation, depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees. competitive pressures within and outside our industry may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain key employees which could adversely affect our businesses.
unexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations.
unexpected events, including fires or explosions at facilities, natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes, war or terrorist activities, unplanned outages, supply disruptions, failure of equipment or systems or changes in laws and/or regulations impacting our businesses, could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations. these events could result in customer disruption, physical damage to one or more key operating facilities, the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems.
8
we may recognize impairment charges, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
we assess our goodwill and other intangible assets and our long-lived assets for impairment when required by u.s. gaap. these accounting principles require that we record an impairment charge if circumstances indicate that the asset carrying values exceed their estimated fair values. the estimated fair value of these assets is impacted by general economic conditions in the locations in which we operate. deterioration in these general economic conditions may result in: declining revenue, which can lead to excess capacity and declining operating cash flow; reductions in management's estimates for future revenue and operating cash flow growth; increases in borrowing rates and other deterioration in factors that impact our weighted average cost of capital; and deteriorating real estate values. if our assessment of goodwill, other intangible assets or long-lived assets indicates an impairment of the carrying value for which we recognize an impairment charge, this may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.
the effects of credit market volatility and changes in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.
our operating cash flows, combined with access to the credit markets, provide us with significant discretionary funding capacity. however, deterioration in the global credit markets may limit our ability to access credit markets, which could adversely affect our liquidity and/or increase our cost of borrowing. in addition, credit market deterioration and its actual or perceived effects on our results of operations and financial condition, along with deterioration in general economic conditions, may increase the likelihood that the major independent credit agencies will downgrade our credit ratings, which could increase our cost of borrowing. increases in our cost of borrowing could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.
item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business strategy cintas helps more than one million businesses of all types and sizes, primarily in north america, as well as latin america, europe and asia, get readytm to open their doors with confidence every day by providing a wide range of products and services that enhance our customers' image and help keep their facilities and employees clean, safe and looking their best. with products and services including uniforms, floor care, restroom supplies, first aid and safety products, fire extinguishers and testing, and safety and compliance training, cintas helps customers get ready for the workdaytm.
we are north america's leading provider of corporate identity uniforms through rental and sales programs, as well as a significant provider of related business services, including entrance mats, restroom cleaning services and supplies, carpet and tile cleaning services, first aid and safety services and fire protection products and services.
cintas' principal objective is "to exceed customers' expectations in order to maximize the long-term value of cintas for shareholders and working partners," and it provides the framework and focus for cintas' business strategy. this strategy is to achieve revenue growth for all of our products and services by increasing our penetration at existing customers and by broadening our customer base to include business segments to which we have not historically served. we will also continue to identify additional product and service opportunities for our current and future customers.
to pursue the strategy of increasing penetration, we have a highly talented and diverse team of service professionals visiting our customers on a regular basis. this frequent contact with our customers enables us to develop close personal relationships. the combination of our distribution system and these strong customer relationships provides a platform from which we launch additional products and services.
we pursue the strategy of broadening our customer base in several ways. cintas has a national sales organization introducing all of our products and services to prospects in all business segments. our broad range of products and services allows our sales organization to consider any type of business a prospect. we also broaden our customer base through geographic expansion, especially in our first aid and safety and fire protection businesses. finally, we evaluate strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise.
results of operations on march 21, 2017, cintas completed the acquisition of g&k services, inc. (g&k) for consideration of approximately $2.1 billion. g&k is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of cintas that will operate within the uniform rental and facility services operating segment. to finance the g&k acquisition, cintas used a combination of new senior notes, a term loan, other borrowings under its existing credit facility and cash on hand. g&k's results of operations are included in cintas' consolidated financial statements as of and from the date of acquisition.
u. s. gaap requires companies to evaluate their reportable operating segments periodically and when certain events occur. as a result of our evaluation in fiscal 2016, effective june 1, 2015, cintas realigned its organizational structure and updated its reportable operating segments in light of certain changes in its business, including the acquisition of zee medical inc. (zee) in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. cintas' updated reportable operating segments are uniform rental and facility services and first aid and safety services. the uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment, which includes g&k, consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing, mats, mops and shop towels and other ancillary items. in addition to these rental items, restroom cleaning services and supplies, carpet and tile cleaning services and the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route are included within this reportable operating segment. the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment, which includes zee, consists of first aid and safety products and services. the remainder of cintas' business, which consists of fire protection services and its uniform direct sale business, is included in all other. cintas evaluates operating segment performance based on revenue and income before income taxes. revenue and income before income taxes for each of these reportable operating segments for the years ended may 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are presented in note 14 entitled operating segment information of "notes to consolidated financial statements." the company regularly reviews its operating segments for reporting purposes based on the information its chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance and makes changes when appropriate.
15
at may 31, 2017, cintas has classified a significant business, referred to as discontinued services, as held for sale.  prior to meeting the held for sale criteria, discontinued services was primarily included in all other. in fiscal 2014, cintas completed its partnership transaction with the shareholders of shred-it international inc. to combine shredding with the shredding business of shred-it international inc. pursuant to the shredding transaction, the shred-it partnership was owned 42% by cintas and 58% by the shareholders of shred-it international inc. cintas' investment in shred-it and the results of shredding are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented as a result of selling the investment during fiscal 2016. during fiscal 2015, cintas sold storage and, as a result, its operations are also classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets and discontinued operations, the results of discontinued services, shredding and storage have been excluded from both continuing operations and operating segment results for all periods presented. please see note 16 entitled discontinued operations of "notes to consolidated financial statements" for additional information.

fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
fiscal 2017 total revenue was $5.3 billion, an increase of 11.0% over the prior fiscal year. revenue increased organically by 6.7% as a result of increased sales volume. organic growth adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, workday differences and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. total revenue was positively impacted by 4.8% due to acquisitions, primarily through the acquisition of g&k. revenue growth was negatively impacted by 0.1% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and 0.4% due to one less workday in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.
organic growth by quarter is shown in the table below.
organic growth first quarter ending august 31, 2016                6.0%
second quarter ending november 30, 2016             6.0%
third quarter ending february 28, 2017              6.6%
fourth quarter ending may 31, 2017                  8.1%
for the fiscal year ending may 31, 2017             6.7%
uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment revenue consists predominantly of revenue derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms and other garments, including flame resistant clothing, and the rental and/or sale of mats, mops, shop towels, restroom supplies and other rental services. revenue from the uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment increased 11.8% compared to fiscal 2016. the increase resulted from an organic growth increase in revenue of 6.9%. the amount of new business grew, resulting from an increase in the number and productivity of sales representatives. generally, sales productivity improvements are the result of increased tenure and improved training, which result in a higher number of products and services sold. revenue growth was negatively impacted by 0.1% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and 0.4% due to one less workday in fiscal 2017 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. revenue was positively impacted by 5.4% due to acquisitions, primarily g&k.
other revenue, consisting of revenue from the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment and all other, increased 8.2% compared to fiscal 2016. revenue increased organically by 6.1% due primarily to improved sales representative productivity. revenue growth was negatively impacted by 0.1% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and 0.4% due to one less workday in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. acquisitions positively impacted revenue by 2.6%.
cost of uniform rental and facility services increased 10.3% compared to fiscal 2016. cost of uniform rental and facility services consists primarily of production expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory, including uniforms, mats, shop towels and other ancillary items. the cost of uniform rental and facility services increase compared to fiscal 2016 was due to increased uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment sales volume from internal growth and the acquired g&k sales volume.
cost of other consists primarily of cost of goods sold (predominantly first aid and safety products, uniforms and fire protection products), delivery expenses and distribution expenses in the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment and all other. cost of other increased 5.6% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. the increase was primarily related to the increased sales volumes in the first aid and safety services reportable operating segment and all other.
selling and administrative expenses increased $195.0 million, or 14.6%, compared to fiscal 2016 due primarily to increases in labor and other employee-partner related expenses. as a result of the acquisition of g&k in fiscal 2017, the company incurred various transaction and integration expenses which relate primarily to asset impairment charges, legal and professional fees, employee termination expenses, the write-off of excess inventory and other miscellaneous expenses. in fiscal 2017, g&k transaction and integration expenses were $79.2 million or 1.5% of total revenue.
net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) was $86.3 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $63.6 million in fiscal 2016. the increase in net interest expense is primarily due to the additional debt issued to finance the g&k acquisition and $17.1 million of short-term debt financing fees incurred in connection with the acquisition.

income before income taxes was $687.4 million, a decrease of $17.9 million, or 2.5%, compared to fiscal 2016. the decrease in income before income taxes was due to the g&k transaction and integration expenses and the increase in interest expense previously mentioned. these impacts were partially offset by the increase in gross margin.
cintas' effective tax rate on continuing operations was 33.5% for fiscal 2017 compared to 36.4% in fiscal 2016. the decrease was primarily due to the adoption of accounting standard update (asu) 2016-09, "improvements to employee share-based payment accounting." the effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 included a benefit of $29.4 million as a result of the adoption of asu 2016-09. this benefit was partially offset by the election to recognize forfeitures as they occur, which resulted in additional stock compensation expense of $8.3 million when compared to our historical practice of estimating forfeiture for expense purposes. the adoption of asu 2016-09 also resulted in an increase in the effect of dilutive securities in fiscal 2017 of 0.8 million shares. for fiscal 2017, the net impact on diluted earnings per share from the adoption of asu 2016-09 was an increase of $0.19 per share over what diluted earnings per share would have been if asu 2016-09 was not adopted in the current year.
net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2017 of $457.3 million was a 1.9% increase compared to fiscal 2016. diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.17 was a 3.7% increase compared to fiscal 2016. diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased due to the lower effective tax rate combined with the decrease in weighted average common shares outstanding. the decrease in weighted average common shares outstanding resulted from purchasing 8.8 million shares of common stock under the january 13, 2015 and august 4, 2015 share buyback programs since the beginning of fiscal 2016.

(merger sub), a wholly-owned subsidiary of cintas. the term loan was funded upon the consummation of the merger. the credit agreement has an accordion feature that provides cintas the ability to request increases to the borrowing commitments under either the revolving credit facility or the term loan of up to $250.0 million in the aggregate, subject to customary conditions. the maturity date of the agreement is september 15, 2021. as of may 31, 2017, there was $50.5 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 1.24% and maturity dates less than 30 days and no borrowings on our revolving credit facility. no commercial paper or borrowings on our revolving credit facility were outstanding at may 31, 2016.
cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements. these covenants limit cintas' ability to incur certain liens, to engage in sale-leaseback transactions and to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of cintas' assets. these covenants also require cintas to maintain certain debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda) and interest coverage ratios. cross-default provisions exist between certain debt instruments. if a default of a significant covenant were to occur, the default could result in an acceleration of the
22
maturity of the indebtedness, impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital. cintas was in compliance with all of the debt covenants for all periods presented.
our access to the commercial paper and long-term debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity.  we do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past. our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and long-term debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend, to a significant degree, on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness. as of may 31, 2017, our ratings were as follows:
rating agency               outlook   commercial paper   long-term debt standard &amp; poor's       stable    a-2                bbb+
moody's investors service   stable    p-2                a3
in the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding long-term debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason, or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of long-term debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above, particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings, our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected. in addition, in such a case, our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and long-term debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above. the rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.
to monitor our credit rating and our capacity for long-term financing, we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors. one such factor is the ratio of our total debt to ebitda. for the purpose of this calculation, debt is defined as the sum of short-term borrowings, long-term debt due within one year, obligations under capital leases due in one year, long-term debt and long-term obligations under capital leases.

cintas also makes payments to defined contribution plans. the amount of contributions made to the defined contribution plans are at the discretion of the board of directors of cintas. future contributions are expected to be $51.7 million in the next year, $111.2 million in the next two to three years, and $122.6 million in the next four to five years. cintas may make payments to defined benefit plans to satisfy minimum funding requirements. currently, cintas does not expect to make any such payments during the next five years.

inflation and changing prices changes in wages, benefits and energy costs have the potential to materially impact cintas' consolidated financial results. management believes inflation has not had a material impact on cintas' consolidated financial condition or a negative impact on consolidated results of operations.
litigation and other contingencies cintas is subject to legal proceedings, insurance receipts, legal settlements and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. in the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary course of business actions will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows of cintas.
new accounting standards in april 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standard update (asu) 2014-08, "reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity," which amended accounting guidance related to the reporting of discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity. the amended guidance changes the thresholds for disposals to qualify as discontinued operations and requires additional disclosures. this guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2014 and is required to be applied prospectively. cintas adopted asu 2014-08 during the quarter ended august 31, 2015 and applied the amended accounting guidance to shred-it and will apply it to future transactions, as appropriate.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606)," to clarify revenue recognition principles. this guidance is intended to improve disclosure requirements and enhance the comparability of revenue recognition practices. improved disclosures under the amended guidance relate to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized from contracts with customers. this guidance will be effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017 and will be required to be applied retrospectively. early application of the amendments in this update is not permitted. a cross-functional implementation team has been established consisting of representatives from all of our operating segments. the implementation team is working to analyze the impact of the standard on the cintas' contract portfolio by reviewing current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that would result from applying the requirements of the new standard to revenue contracts. in addition, we are in the process of identifying and implementing the appropriate changes to business processes and controls to support recognition and disclosure under the new standard. cintas plans to adopt the standard as of the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 using the modified retrospective approach and will record a cumulative adjustment to equity for open contracts as of june 1, 2018. cintas is continuing to evaluate the impact of asu 2014-09 and an estimate of the impact to the consolidated financial statements cannot be made at this time.
in april 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-17, "balance sheet classifications of deferred taxes," which amended accounting guidance related to the presentation of deferred tax liabilities and assets. the amended guidance requires that all deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. this guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016; however, early adoption is permitted. this guidance can also be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. cintas adopted asu 2015-17 during the quarter ended november 30, 2015 and has applied this amended accounting guidance to its deferred tax liabilities and assets for all periods presented.
24
in april 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-03, "interest - imputation of interest (subtopic 835-30), simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs." asu 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the consolidated condensed balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. this guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15, 2015. the guidance is applied retrospectively and early adoption is permitted. cintas adopted asu 2015-03 during the quarter ended august 31, 2016 and has applied this amended accounting guidance to its long-term debt and other assets for all periods presented. the impact of this change in accounting principle on balances previously reported as of may 31, 2016 was a reclassification of $5.6 million from other assets to debt due after one year within long-term liabilities.
in september 2015, the fasb issued asu 2015-16, "business combinations (topic 805), simplifying the accounting for measurement-period adjustments." this amendment eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. this amendment became effective for cintas beginning june 1, 2016, and was adopted prospectively in accordance with the standard. the adoption of this amendment did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended may 31, 2017.
in february 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-02, "leases (topic 842)," which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). the new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. this classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. a lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. topic 842 supersedes the previous leases standard, asc 840, leases. this guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2018; however, early adoption is permitted. entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. cintas is currently evaluating the impact that asu 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements.
in march 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-09, "improvements to employee share-based payment accounting." asu 2016-09 is intended to simplify accounting for share-based payments. upon adoption, asu 2016-09 requires that excess tax benefits for share-based payments be recorded as a reduction of income tax expense and reflected within operating cash flows rather than being recorded within equity and reflected within financing cash flows. the standard also permits the repurchase of more of an employee's shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting, clarifies that all cash payments made on an employee's behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing activity on our cash flows statement, and provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. this update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15, 2016; however, early adoption is permitted. cintas adopted asu 2016-09 during the quarter ended august 31, 2016 and elected to make an accounting policy change to recognize forfeitures as they occur. the adoption impact on the consolidated balance sheet was a cumulative-effect adjustment of $26.7 million, increasing opening retained earnings and decreasing paid-in capital.
in march 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-07, "improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit costs." asu 2017-07 continues to require the service component of pension and other postretirement benefit costs to be presented in the same line item as other employee compensation costs on the consolidated statement of income and changes the presentation of other components of net benefit cost so that these items will be presented outside of operating income within the consolidated statements of income. cintas plans to adopt asu 2017-07 in fiscal 2018 and apply it prospectively. cintas does not expect the adoption of asu 2017-07 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
no other new accounting pronouncement recently issued or newly effective had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
25
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of cintas' consolidated financial statements in conformity with u. s. gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. these critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with note 1 entitled significant accounting policies of "notes to consolidated financial statements." significant changes, estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies could possibly have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition rental revenue, which is recorded in the uniform rental and facility services reportable operating segment, is recognized when services are performed. other revenue, which is recorded in the first aid and safety services reportable operating segments and all other, is recognized when either services are performed or when products are shipped and the title and risks of ownership pass to the customer.
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply variances between actual and standard costs to the inventory balances. the judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventories at the lower of cost or market. an inventory obsolescence reserve is determined by specific identification, as well as an estimate based on the company's historical rates of obsolescence.
uniforms and other rental items in service uniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization, calculated using the straight-line method. uniforms in service (other than cleanroom and flame resistant clothing) are amortized over their useful life of 18 months. uniforms acquired in the g&k acquisition will be amortized over 12 months. other rental items, including shop towels, mats, mops, cleanroom garments, flame resistant clothing, linens and restroom dispensers, are amortized over their useful lives, which range from 8 to 60 months. the amortization rates used are based on industry experience, cintas' specific experience and wear tests performed by cintas. these factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory and related cost of uniforms and ancillary products that are presented in the consolidated financial statements.
property and equipment depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets based on industry and cintas specific experience, which is typically 30 to 40 years for buildings, 5 to 20 years for building improvements, 3 to 10 years for equipment and 2 to 15 years for leasehold improvements. when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are compared to the carrying amount of the assets. if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss is recorded based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. fair value is generally determined by discounted cash flows or based on prices of similar assets, as appropriate. as a result of the identification of certain g&k plants and branches for future closure, an indicator of potential impairment was identified. cintas recognized an impairment loss of $23.3 million during the year ended may 31, 2017, based on the excess of the carrying amount of asset over their respective fair values. the undiscounted cash flows were estimated, using level 2 inputs based on both the cost and market approaches, at the lowest discernible level, which is at the location level. cintas did not identify any indicators of impairment for the years ended may 31, 2016 and 2015.
goodwill goodwill, obtained through acquisitions of businesses, is valued at cost less any impairment. cintas completes an annual impairment test, which may include an assessment of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance. the test may also include the determination of the estimated fair value of cintas' reporting units via comparisons to current market values, where available, and discounted cash flow analyses. significant assumptions may include growth rates based on historical trends and margin improvement leveraged from such growth, as well as discount rates. we determine discount rates separately for each reporting unit using the weighted average cost of capital, which includes a calculation of cost of equity, which is developed using the capital asset pricing model and comparable company betas (a measure of systemic risk), and cost of debt. we also use comparable market earnings
26
multiple data and our market capitalization to corroborate our reporting unit valuations. we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. as a result of cintas' operating segment realignment in fiscal 2016 and the acquisition of g&k in fiscal 2017, the composition of cintas' reporting units for the evaluation of goodwill impairment has changed. cintas has identified six reporting units for purposes of evaluating goodwill impairment: uniform rental and facility services, g&k services uniform rental and facility services, first aid and safety services, and three reporting units within all other. given the proximity of the g&k acquisition date to the consolidated balance sheet date, the company performed a high level qualitative analysis for its g&k reporting unit, which considered indicators of impairment to evaluate whether the fair value was more-likely-than-not in excess of its carrying value. the key indicators considered include macroeconomic conditions, industry/market considerations, financial performance, cash flow, changes in management, and composition of net assets. based on the results of the annual impairment tests, cintas was not required to recognize an impairment of goodwill for the fiscal years ended may 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015. cintas will continue to perform impairment tests as of march 1 in future years and when indicators of impairment exist.
service contracts and other assets service contracts and other assets, which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses, are amortized by use of the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the agreements, which are generally 5 to 10 years. the g&k service contract asset will be amortized over a period of 15 years, which represents the estimated life of the economic benefit and the asset amortization is based on the annual economic value of the underlying asset which generally decreases over the 15-year term. certain noncompete agreements, as well as all service contracts, require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model. the assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates, among other factors. because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets, actual results over time could vary from original estimates. impairment of service contracts and other assets is accomplished through specific identification. no impairment has been recognized by cintas for the fiscal years ended may 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015.
business combinations accounting for acquisitions requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. while we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. as a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income. see note 9 entitled acquisitions and divestitures of the "notes to consolidated financial statements" for a discussion of the g&k and zee acquisitions.
general insurance liabilities general insurance liabilities represent the estimated ultimate cost of all asserted and unasserted claims incurred, primarily related to worker's compensation, auto liability and other general liability exposure through the consolidated balance sheet dates. our reserves are estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions, adjusted for specific expectations based on our claims history. cintas records an increase or decrease in selling and administrative expenses related to development of prior claims, higher claims activity and other environmental factors in the period in which it becomes known. these changes in estimates may be material to the consolidated financial statements.
stock-based compensation compensation expense is recognized for all share-based payments to employees, including stock options and restricted stock awards, in the consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of the awards that are granted. the fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the black-scholes option-pricing model. measured compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the related share-based compensation award. see note 12 entitled stock-based compensation of "notes to consolidated financial statements" for further information.
27
litigation and other contingencies cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. u.s. gaap requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability, as well as the amount to be recorded. while a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities, cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements.
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. see note 8 entitled income taxes of "notes to consolidated financial statements" for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities. deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes. cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets, as adjusted for valuation allowances, will be realized.
accounting for uncertain tax positions requires the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. companies may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions, cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate. based on cintas' evaluation of current tax positions, cintas believes its tax related accruals are appropriate.

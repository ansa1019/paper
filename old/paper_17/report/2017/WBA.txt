item 1a.  risk factors in addition to the other information in this report and our other filings with the sec, you should carefully consider the risks described below, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. these risks are not the only risks that we face. our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial.
reductions in third party reimbursement levels, from private or governmental agency plans, and potential changes in industry pricing benchmarks for prescription drugs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
the substantial majority of the prescriptions we fill are reimbursed by third party payers, including private and governmental agency payers. the continued efforts of health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations, pbm companies, governmental agencies, and other third party payers to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates, as well as litigation and other legal proceedings relating to how drugs are priced, may adversely impact our results of operations. in the united states, plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in january and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term. in addition, in an environment where some pbm clients utilize narrow or restricted pharmacy provider networks, some of these entities may offer pricing terms that we may not be willing to accept or otherwise restrict our participation in their networks of pharmacy providers.
changes in political, economic and regulatory influences also may significantly affect healthcare financing and prescription drug reimbursement practices. in the united states, for example, there have been multiple attempts through legislative action and legal challenges to repeal or amend the aca, in whole and in part. we cannot predict whether current or future efforts to repeal or amend these laws will be successful, nor can we predict the impact that such a repeal or amendment and any subsequent legislation would have on our business and reimbursement levels. there have also been a number of other proposals and enactments by the federal government and various states to reduce medicare part d and medicaid reimbursement levels in response to budget deficits, and we expect additional proposals in the future. there can be no assurance that recent or future changes in prescription drug reimbursement policies and practices will not materially and adversely affect our results of operations. in many countries where we have operations, the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. efforts to control healthcare costs, including prescription drug costs, are continuous and reductions in third party reimbursement levels could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
in addition, many payers in the united states are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, average manufacturer price, and actual acquisition cost. it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate and/or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price, which is the pricing reference used for many of our contracts. in addition, many state medicaid fee-for-service programs moved to establish pharmacy network payments on the basis of actual acquisition cost by april 1, 2017, which potentially could have an impact on reimbursement practices in other commercial and government arrangements. future changes to the pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing, including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by third party payers, could adversely affect us.
a shift in pharmacy mix toward lower margin plans and programs could adversely affect our results of operations.
our retail pharmacy usa division seeks to grow prescription volume while operating in a marketplace with continuous reimbursement pressure. a shift in the mix of pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates could adversely affect our results of operations. for example, our retail pharmacy usa division has experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90-day at retail in recent years. our 90-day at retail offering for patients with chronic prescription
- 9 -
needs typically is at a lower margin than comparable 30-day prescriptions. our retail pharmacy usa division also experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards medicare part d prescriptions in fiscal 2017, and that trend may continue. preferred medicare part d networks have increased in number in recent years; however, we do not participate in all such networks. we have accepted lower reimbursement rates in order to secure preferred relationships with medicare part d plans serving senior patients with significant pharmacy needs. we also have worked to develop and expand our relationships with commercial third party payers to enable new and/or improved market access via participation in the pharmacy provider networks they offer. if we are not able to generate additional prescription volume and other business from patients participating in these programs that is sufficient to offset the impact of lower reimbursement, or if the degree or terms of our participation in such preferred networks declines from current levels in future years, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
we could be adversely affected by a decrease in the introduction of new brand name and generic prescription drugs as well as increases in the cost to procure prescription drugs.
the profitability of our pharmacy businesses depends upon the utilization of prescription drugs. utilization trends are affected by, among other factors, the introduction of new and successful prescription drugs as well as lower-priced generic alternatives to existing brand name drugs. inflation in the price of drugs also can adversely affect utilization, particularly given the increased prevalence of high-deductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes. new brand name drugs can result in increased drug utilization and associated sales, while the introduction of lower priced generic alternatives typically results in relatively lower sales, but relatively higher gross profit margins. accordingly, a decrease in the number or magnitude of significant new brand name drugs or generics successfully introduced, delays in their introduction, or a decrease in the utilization of previously introduced prescription drugs, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
in addition, if we experience an increase in the amounts we pay to procure pharmaceutical drugs, including generic drugs, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. our gross profit margins would be adversely affected to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increases. any failure to fully offset any such increased prices and costs or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. additionally, any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our expectations.
we derive a significant portion of our sales in the united states from prescription drug sales reimbursed by a limited number of pharmacy benefit management companies.
we derive a significant portion of our sales in the united states from prescription drug sales reimbursed through prescription drug plans administered by a limited number of pbm companies. pbm companies typically administer multiple prescription drug plans that expire at various times and provide for varying reimbursement rates, and often limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication. there can be no assurance that we will continue to participate in any particular pbm company's pharmacy provider network in any particular future time period. if our participation in the pharmacy provider network for a prescription drug plan administered by one or more of the large pbm companies is restricted or terminated, we expect that our sales would be adversely affected, at least in the short-term. if we are unable to replace any such lost sales, either through an increase in other sales or through a resumption of participation in those plans, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. if we exit a pharmacy provider network and later resume participation, there can be no assurance that we will achieve any particular level of business on any particular pace, or that all clients of the pbm company will choose to include us again in the pharmacy network for their plans, initially or at all. in addition, in such circumstances we may incur increased marketing and other costs in connection with initiatives to regain former patients and attract new patients covered by such plans.
consolidation and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business operations, competitive positioning, financial condition and results of operations.
many organizations in the healthcare industry, including pbm companies, have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power, which has resulted in greater pricing pressures. if this consolidation trend continues, it could give the resulting enterprises even greater bargaining power, which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services. if these pressures result in reductions in our prices, our businesses would become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in costs or develop profitable new revenue streams.
new partnerships and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry also can alter market dynamics and impact our businesses and competitive positioning. for example, following the entry into our strategic relationship with amerisourcebergen providing for, among other things, generic drug purchasing through our global sourcing enterprise, some of our retail pharmacy competitors subsequently established relationships with other pharmaceutical drug wholesalers and others relating to generic drug procurement. changes in the participants in such global sourcing enterprises, whether as a result of mergers, acquisitions
- 10 -
or other transactions, can have a similar effect. in addition, further consolidation among generic drug manufacturers could lead to generic drug inflation in the future. we expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements, and other pressures will continue to cause the healthcare industry to evolve, potentially resulting in further business consolidations and alliances and increased vertical integration among the industry participants we engage with, and which could, if we are not able to successfully anticipate and respond to evolving industry conditions in a timely and effective manner, materially and adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
our growth strategy is partially dependent upon our ability to identify and successfully complete acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic alliances.
a significant element of our growth strategy is to identify, pursue and successfully complete acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic alliances that either expand or complement our existing operations. we have grown significantly through acquisitions in recent years and expect to continue to acquire, partner with or invest in businesses that build on or are deemed complementary to our existing businesses or further our strategic objectives. due in part to consolidation in the industries in which we compete, there is significant competition for attractive targets and opportunities when available. there can be no assurance that attractive acquisition or other strategic relationship opportunities will be available, that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating and consummating favorable transaction opportunities, or that any such transactions we complete will be successful and justify our investment of financial and other resources therein.
acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in successfully integrating the operations and personnel, distraction of management from overseeing, and disruption of, our existing operations, difficulties in entering markets or lines of business in which we have no or limited direct prior experience, the possible loss of key employees and customers, and difficulties in achieving the synergies we anticipated. any failure to select suitable opportunities at fair prices, conduct appropriate due diligence and successfully integrate the acquired company, including particularly when acquired businesses operate in new geographic markets or areas of business, could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. these transactions may also cause us to significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition or investment, issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders' percentage ownership, or incur asset write-offs and restructuring costs and other related expenses that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments also involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to assumed litigation and unknown environmental and other liabilities, as well as undetected internal control, regulatory or other issues, or additional costs not anticipated at the time the transaction was completed. no assurance can be given that our acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic alliances will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operations, financial condition or results of operations. if we are unable to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments in a timely and effective manner, our business operations and growth strategies could be negatively affected.
our strategic relationships include outsourcing and similar relationships. we outsource certain business and administrative functions and rely on third parties to perform certain services on our behalf. for example, in july 2017 we announced a binding offer from fareva for a 10-year global agreement for the manufacture and supply of own beauty brands and private label products. under the terms of the proposed agreement, fareva will take ownership of bcm, walgreens boots alliance's contract manufacturing business, which operates factories in the united kingdom, france and germany. the proposed agreement, which is subject to certain closing conditions, is expected to be completed by the end of calendar year 2017. we rely on these third parties to meet our quality and performance requirements and to timely perform as expected. we periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. if our continuing relationship with certain third-party providers is interrupted, or if such third-party providers experience disruptions or do not perform as anticipated, or we experience problems with any transition, we may experience operational difficulties, reputational harm, and increased costs that could materially and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations.
we may not be able to successfully or timely complete the acquisition of certain rite aid assets.
risks and uncertainties related to our acquisition of 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from rite aid pursuant to the amended and restated asset purchase agreement include, among others, the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could impact our ability to complete the closing conditions set forth in the amended and restated asset purchase agreement, including that litigation may be filed which could prevent or delay completion of the transaction, and that uncertainty regarding the transaction may adversely affect relationships with suppliers, payers, customers and other third parties. while we have completed the acquisition of the first few rite aid stores pursuant to the amended and restated asset purchase agreement as of the date of this report, ownership of stores is expected to be transferred in phases, with the
- 11 -
goal being to complete the store transfers in spring 2018. completion of the remaining asset acquisition transactions is subject to the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in the amended and restated asset purchase agreement. we will be unable to complete the acquisition of these rite aid assets until each of the conditions to closing is either satisfied or waived. we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the transaction, as well as the diversion of management resources, for which we will receive little or no benefit if the closing of the remaining asset acquisitions do not occur.
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of certain rite aid assets pursuant to the amended and restated asset purchase agreement, which could adversely impact our results of operations.
we entered into the amended and restated asset purchase agreement to acquire certain rite aid stores and distribution centers with the expectation that the transaction will result in various benefits, including, among other things, cost savings and operating efficiencies. the achievement of the anticipated benefits of the transaction is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the acquired assets can be integrated into our business in an efficient and effective manner, the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process, unforeseen expenses or delays, and competitive factors in the marketplace. we can provide no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the transaction, including cost savings and synergies, will be fully realized in the time frame anticipated or at all; the costs or difficulties related to the integration of the acquired assets into our business and operations will not be greater than expected; unanticipated costs, charges and expenses will not result from the transaction; litigation relating to the transaction will not be filed; and the transaction will not cause disruption to the parties' business and operations and relationships with employees and suppliers, payers, customers and other third parties. if one or more of these risks are realized, it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.
we could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integration-related costs or other circumstances, such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues resulting from the transaction. many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention, which could adversely impact our agility to respond to market opportunities and our ability to timely identify and implement other strategic actions. if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, we have incurred significant transaction costs related to the transaction and expect to continue to incur significant integration and related costs as we integrate the acquired rite aid assets. these integration and acquisition-related costs, including legal, accounting, financial and tax advisory and other fees and costs, may be higher than expected and some of these costs may be material.
our substantial international business operations subject us to a number of operating, economic, political, regulatory and other international business risks.
our substantial international business operations are important to our growth and prospects, including particularly those of our retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale divisions, and are subject to a number of risks, including:
•   compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including retail and wholesale pharmacy, licensing, tax, foreign trade, intellectual property, privacy and data protection, immigration, currency, political and other business restrictions and requirements and local laws and regulations, whose interpretation and enforcement vary significantly among jurisdictions and can change significantly over time;
•   additional u.s. and other regulation of non-domestic operations, including regulation under the foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act and other anti-corruption laws;
•   potential difficulties in managing foreign operations, mitigating credit risks in foreign markets, enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;
•   price controls imposed by foreign countries;
•   tariffs, duties or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade sanctions and other trade barriers imposed by foreign countries that restrict or prohibit business transactions in certain markets;
•   potential adverse tax consequences, including tax withholding laws and policies and restrictions on repatriation of funds to the united states;
- 12 -
•   fluctuations in currency exchange rates;
•   impact of recessions and economic slowdowns in economies outside the united states, including foreign currency devaluation, higher interest rates, inflation, and increased government regulation or ownership of traditional private businesses;
•   the instability of foreign economies, governments and currencies and unexpected regulatory, economic or political changes in foreign markets; and
•   developing and emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of instability and unexpected changes, and consumers in those markets may have relatively limited resources to spend on products and services.
these factors can also adversely affect our payers, vendors and customers in international markets, which in turn can negatively impact our businesses. we cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operation and financial condition.
many of these factors are subject to change based on changes in political, economic and regulatory influences. for example:
•   our retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale divisions have substantial operations in the united kingdom and other member countries of the european union. on june 23, 2016, voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union, which proposed exit (and the political, economic and other uncertainties it has raised) has exacerbated and may further exacerbate many of the risks and uncertainties described above. negotiations on withdrawal and post-exit arrangements likely will be complex and protracted, and there can be no assurance regarding the terms, timing or consummation of any such arrangements. the proposed withdrawal could, among other potential outcomes, adversely affect the tax, tax treaty, currency, operational, legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses in the region are subject. the withdrawal could also, among other potential outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the united kingdom and the european union and significantly disrupt trade between the united kingdom and the european union and other parties. further, uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the united kingdom and the other economies in which we operate.
•   many of the products we sell are manufactured in whole or in part outside of the united states. in some cases, these products are imported by others and sold to us. following the november 2016 election in the united states, the new administration has discussed or sought to implement changes with respect to certain tax and trade policies, tariffs and other government regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries. while it is not possible to predict whether or when any such changes will occur or what form they may take, significant changes in tax or trade policies, tariffs or trade relations between the united states and other countries could result in significant increases in our costs, restrict our access to certain suppliers and adversely impact economic activity. in addition, other countries may change their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in united states trade policy and regulations.
there can be no assurance that any or all of these developments will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations and financial condition.
we are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
our significant operations outside of the united states expose us to currency exchange rate fluctuations and related risks, including transaction currency exposures relating to the import and export of goods in currencies other than businesses' functional currencies as well as currency translation exposures relating to profits and net assets denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. we present our financial statements in u.s. dollars and have a significant proportion of net assets and income in non-u.s. dollar currencies, primarily the british pound sterling and the euro, as well as a range of other foreign currencies. our results of operations and capital ratios can therefore be sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates. due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future results of operations. in addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the u.s. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. a depreciation of non-u.s. dollar currencies relative to the u.s. dollar could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations.
- 13 -
we may from time to time, in some instances, enter into foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency fluctuation risks, which subjects us to additional risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations to us, that could materially and adversely affect us. additionally, we may (and currently do) use foreign currency borrowings to hedge some of our foreign currency fluctuation risks. the periodic use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. we cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including particularly the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, will not materially affect our consolidated financial results.
our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change and business transformation and achieve cost savings and operating efficiency initiatives.
our board of directors approved the plan to implement the store optimization program described in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii, item 7 below as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. there can be no assurance that we will realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits of this program. our financial goals assume a level of productivity improvement, including those reflected in the store optimization program and other business optimization initiatives. if we are unable to deliver these expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, or if the volume and nature of change overwhelms available resources, our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted. our ability to successfully manage and execute these initiatives and realize expected savings and benefits in the amounts and at the times anticipated is important to our business success. any failure to do so, which could result from our inability to successfully execute organizational change and business transformation plans, changes in global or regional economic conditions, competition, changes in the industries in which we compete, unanticipated costs or charges, loss of key personnel and other factors described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.
disruption in our global supply chain could negatively impact our businesses.
the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors, and any future disruption in our supply chain or inability to find qualified vendors and access products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our businesses. the loss or disruption of such supply arrangements for any reason, including for issues such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, inability to procure sufficient raw materials, quality control issues, ethical sourcing issues, a supplier's financial distress, natural disasters, civil unrest or acts of war or terrorism, trade sanctions or other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
we use a single wholesaler of branded and generic pharmaceutical drugs as our primary source of such products for our retail pharmacy usa division.
in march 2013, walgreens, alliance boots and amerisourcebergen announced various agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between walgreens and amerisourcebergen pursuant to which we source branded and generic pharmaceutical products from amerisourcebergen in the u.s. and an agreement which provides amerisourcebergen the ability to access generics pharmaceutical products through our global sourcing enterprise. in may 2016, certain of these agreements were extended for three years to now expire in 2026. in addition, in march 2013, walgreens, alliance boots and amerisourcebergen entered into agreements and arrangements pursuant to which we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in amerisourcebergen and gain associated representation on amerisourcebergen's board of directors in certain circumstances. as of the date of this report, amerisourcebergen distributes for our retail pharmacy usa division substantially all branded and generic pharmaceutical products. consequently, our business in the united states may be adversely affected by any operational, financial or regulatory difficulties that amerisourcebergen experiences. for example, if amerisourcebergen's operations are seriously disrupted for any reason, whether due to a natural disaster, labor disruption, regulatory action, computer or operational systems or otherwise, it could adversely affect our business in the united states and our results of operations.
our distribution agreement with amerisourcebergen is subject to early termination in certain circumstances and, upon the expiration or termination of the agreement, there can be no assurance that we or amerisourcebergen will be willing to renew the agreement or enter into a new agreement, on terms favorable to us or at all. if such expiration or termination occurred, we believe that alternative sources of supply for most generic and brand-name pharmaceuticals are readily available and that we could obtain and qualify alternative sources, which may include self-distribution in some cases, for substantially all of the prescription drugs we sell on an acceptable basis, such that the impact of any such expiration or termination would be
- 14 -
temporary. however, there can be no assurance we would be able to engage alternative supply sources or implement self-distribution processes on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us, or effectively manage these transitions, any of which could adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with amerisourcebergen may not be realized.
we entered into the arrangement with amerisourcebergen with the expectation that the transactions contemplated thereby would result in various benefits including, among other things, procurement cost savings and operating efficiencies, innovation and sharing of best practices. the processes and initiatives needed to achieve these potential benefits are complex, costly and time-consuming. many of the anticipated synergies and expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. achieving the anticipated benefits from the arrangement is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties, including the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations, processes or initiatives, or the inability to realize and/or delays in realizing potential benefits and synergies, whether unique corporate cultures of separate organizations will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner, unforeseen expenses or delays, and competitive factors in the marketplace.
as of august 31, 2017, we beneficially owned approximately 26% of the outstanding amerisourcebergen common stock and had designated one member of amerisourcebergen's board of directors. in addition, we have the right, but not the obligation, under the transactions contemplated by the framework agreement dated as of march 18, 2013 by and among the company, alliance boots and amerisourcebergen (the "framework agreement") to acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 amerisourcebergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another member of amerisourcebergen's board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements. there can be no assurance that we will complete any specific level of such potential equity investments in amerisourcebergen, or that our existing investment, or any future investment if completed, will ultimately be profitable. if the price of amerisourcebergen common stock subsequently declines substantially, we could experience a loss on or impairment of such investment, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. further, our ability to transact in amerisourcebergen securities is subject to certain restrictions set forth in our agreements with amerisourcebergen and arising under applicable laws and regulations, which in some circumstances could adversely our ability to transact in amerisourcebergen securities in amounts and at the times desired. we could also encounter unforeseen costs, circumstances or issues existing or arising with respect to the transactions and collaboration we anticipate resulting from the framework agreement. many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention. if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
from time to time, we make investments in companies over which we do not have sole control. some of these companies may operate in sectors that differ from our current operations and have different risks.
from time to time, we make debt or equity investments in companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole control. for example, while we have a significant equity investment in amerisourcebergen and have a designee serving on the board of directors of amerisourcebergen as of the date of this report, we do not have the ability to control day-to-day operations of that company. although the businesses in which we have made non-controlling investments often have a significant health and daily living or prescription drug component, some of them operate in businesses that are different from our primary lines of business and/or operate in different geographic markets than we do. investments in these businesses, among other risks, subject us to the operating and financial risks of the businesses we invest in and to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operations of these businesses. we rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may materially and adversely affect us. investments in entities over which we do not have sole control, including joint ventures and strategic alliances, present additional risks such as having differing objectives from our partners or the entities in which we are invested, becoming involved in disputes, or competing with those persons. from time to time, we may make additional investments in or acquire other entities that may subject us to similar risks.
changes in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer buying practices.
our performance has been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by changes in global, national, regional or local economic conditions and consumer confidence. these conditions can also adversely affect our key vendors and customers. external factors that affect consumer confidence and over which we exercise no influence include unemployment rates, inflation, levels of personal disposable income, levels of taxes and interest and global, national, regional or local economic conditions, as well as acts of war or terrorism. changes in economic conditions and consumer confidence could adversely
- 15 -
affect consumer preferences, purchasing power and spending patterns, which could lead to a decrease in overall consumer spending as well as in prescription drug and health services utilization and which could be exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of high-deductible health insurance plans and related plan design changes. in addition, reduced or flat consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to offer additional products at promotional prices. all of these factors could materially and adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
economic conditions in europe and certain emerging market countries, together with austerity measures being taken by certain governments, could adversely affect us.
we have significant assets and operations within europe and certain emerging market countries in our retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale divisions. an economic slowdown within any such markets could adversely affect our businesses in affected regions by reducing the prices our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products and services or by reducing the demand for our products and services, either of which could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in recent years, in response to the economic environment, a number of governments, including the government in the united kingdom, have announced or implemented austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending for the government-sponsored healthcare systems and constrain overall government expenditures. these measures, which include efforts aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare costs, continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceutical drugs. countries with existing austerity measures may impose additional laws, regulations, or requirements on the healthcare industry. in addition, governments that have not yet imposed austerity measures may impose them in the future. any new austerity measures may be similar to or vary in scope and nature from existing austerity measures and could have a material adverse effect on our international business operations and results of operations.
the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and constantly evolving. new entrants to the market, existing competitor actions, or other changes in market dynamics could adversely impact us.
the level of competition in the retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries is high. changes in market dynamics or actions of competitors or manufacturers, including industry consolidation and the emergence of new competitors and strategic alliances, could materially and adversely impact us. disruptive innovation by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively. our retail pharmacy businesses face intense competition from local, regional, national and global companies, including other drugstore and pharmacy chains, independent drugstores and pharmacies, mail-order pharmacies and various other retailers such as grocery stores, convenience stores, mass merchants, online and omni-channel pharmacies and retailers, warehouse clubs, dollar stores and other discount merchandisers, some of which are aggressively expanding in markets we serve. businesses in our pharmaceutical wholesale division face intense competition from direct competitors, including national and regional cooperative wholesalers, and alternative supply sources such as importers and manufacturers who supply directly to pharmacies. competition may also come from other sources in the future. as competition increases in the markets in which we operate, a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur, which could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive. for example, if we are not able to anticipate and successfully respond to changes in market conditions in our pharmaceutical wholesale division, including changes driven by competitors, suppliers or manufacturers and increased competition from national and regional cooperative wholesalers, it could result in a loss of customers or renewal of contracts or arrangements on less favorable terms.
we also could be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to changes in market dynamics. for example, specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the united states, a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies. because our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and high-cost medications, many of which are made available by manufacturers to a limited number of pharmacies (so-called limited distribution drugs), that serve a relatively limited universe of patients, the future growth of this business depends to a significant extent upon expanding our ability to access key drugs and successfully penetrate key treatment categories. to better serve this evolving market, on march 31, 2017, we and prime therapeutics llc, a pbm, closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company, alliancerx walgreens prime, using an innovative model that seeks to align pharmacy, pbm and health plans to coordinate patient care, improve health outcomes and deliver cost of care opportunities. if this joint venture does not successfully implement its model or is not able to compete effectively in this evolving market, our business operations, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
if we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omni-channel experience for our customers, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted.
- 16 -
our business has evolved from an in-store experience to interaction with customers across numerous channels, including in-store, online, mobile and social media, among others. omni-channel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors. our customers are increasingly using computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other devices to comparison shop, determine product availability and complete purchases, as well as to provide immediate public reactions regarding various facets of our operations. we must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of the ultimate sales channel and by investing in, providing and maintaining digital tools for our customers that have the right features and are reliable and easy to use. if we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant customer-facing technology in a timely manner that keeps pace with technological developments and dynamic customer expectations, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. in addition, if our online activities or our other customer-facing technology systems do not function as designed, we may experience a loss of customer confidence, data security breaches, lost sales, or be exposed to fraudulent purchases, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, reputation and results of operations.
if the merchandise and services that we offer fail to meet customer needs, our sales may be adversely affected.
we could be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending levels and shopping habits and preferences, including attitudes towards our retail and product brands. the success of our retail pharmacy businesses depends on our ability to offer a superior shopping experience, engaging customer service and a quality assortment of available merchandise that differentiates us from other retailers, including enhanced health and beauty product offerings. we must identify, obtain supplies of, and offer to our customers attractive, innovative and high-quality merchandise on a continuous basis. our products and services must satisfy the needs and desires of our customers, whose preferences may change in the future. it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand. if we misjudge either the demand for products and services we sell or our customers' purchasing habits and tastes, we may be faced with excess inventories of some products and missed opportunities for products and services we chose not to offer. in addition, our sales may decline or we may be required to sell the merchandise we have obtained at lower prices. failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and spending patterns and evolving demographic mixes in the markets we serve could negatively affect our relationship with our customers and the demand for our products and services, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations.
our private brand offerings expose us to various additional risks.
in addition to brand name products, we offer our customers private brand products that are not available from other retailers. we seek to continue to grow our exclusive private brand offerings as part of our growth strategy, including through the expanded offering of no7 and other brands owned or licensed on an exclusive basis, as well as through selective acquisitions. maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of our private brand offerings for our customers, as well as the timely development and introduction of new products, is important in differentiating us from other retailers and developing and maintaining customer loyalty. although we believe that our private brand products offer value to our customers and typically provide us with higher gross margins than comparable national brand products we sell, the expansion of our private brand offerings also subjects us to additional risks, such as potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls; our ability to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties; our ability to successfully administer and comply with applicable contractual obligations and regulatory requirements; and other risks generally encountered by entities that source, sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail. an increase in sales of our private brands may also adversely affect sales of our vendors' products, which, in turn, could adversely affect our relationship with certain of our vendors. any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business operations, results of operations and financial condition.
we may experience a significant disruption in our computer systems.
we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage our ordering, pricing, point-of-sale, pharmacy fulfillment, inventory replenishment, customer loyalty programs, finance and other processes. our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, facility damage, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches including credit card or personally identifiable information breaches, vandalism, natural disasters, catastrophic events, human error and potential cyber threats, including malicious codes, worms, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, ransomware and other sophisticated cyber attacks, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. if any of our systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or disruptions and delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could materially and adversely affect our businesses and results of operations. in addition, we are currently making, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in our information technology systems and
- 17 -
infrastructure, some of which are significant. upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. implementing new systems carries significant potential risks, including failure to operate as designed, potential loss or corruption of data or information, cost overruns, implementation delays, disruption of operations, and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements. while we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems and believe we are taking reasonable action to mitigate known risks, there can be no assurance that we will not experience significant issues with our existing systems prior to implementation, that our technology initiatives will be successfully deployed as planned or that they will be timely implemented without significant disruption to our operations. we also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties we interact with, including key payers and vendors.
if we or the businesses we interact with do not maintain the privacy and security of sensitive customer and business information, it could damage our reputation and we could suffer a loss of revenue, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation and regulatory scrutiny.
the protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to our businesses. cybersecurity and other information technology security risks, such as a significant breach of customer, employee, or company data, could attract a substantial amount of media attention, damage our customer relationships and reputation, and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. throughout our operations, we receive, retain and transmit certain personal information that our customers and others provide to purchase products or services, fill prescriptions, enroll in promotional programs, participate in our customer loyalty programs, register on our websites, or otherwise communicate and interact with us. in addition, aspects of our operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. although we deploy a layered approach to address information security threats and vulnerabilities designed to protect confidential information against data security breaches, a compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with whom we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. in addition, a security breach could require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of information systems and disrupt our businesses.
the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses. we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy regulations in the united states and in other countries in which we operate that regulate the collection, use and transfer of personal data, including the transfer of personal data between or among countries. some foreign data privacy regulations are more stringent than those in the united states and continue to change. for example, in may 2018, the general data protection regulation will supersede current european union data protection legislation, impose more stringent european union data protection requirements, and provide for greater penalties for noncompliance. complying with these and other changing requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs and require us to change our business practices in certain jurisdictions, any of which could materially adversely affect our business operations and operating results. we may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations. compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. if we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach, our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to additional litigation and regulatory risks. our security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information. any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and potentially have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
we are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business operations.
we accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, gift cards and mobile payment technologies such as apple paytm, and we may offer new payment options over time. acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. these requirements and related interpretations may change over time, which could make compliance more difficult or costly. for certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which could increase over
- 18 -
time and raise our operating costs. we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. if these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could disrupt our business. the payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by persons who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. if we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements, or if data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data relating to our payment systems, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments could be impaired. in addition, our reputation could suffer and our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which could result in higher costs and/or reduced sales and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
changes in healthcare regulatory environments may adversely affect our businesses.
political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to significant changes that could adversely affect our results of operations. in recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending. these changes include an increased reliance on managed care; cuts in certain medicare and medicaid funding in the united states and the funding of governmental payers in foreign jurisdictions; consolidation of competitors, suppliers and other market participants; and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups. we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. some of these potential changes, such as a reduction in governmental funding for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing, healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause customers to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services. we expect continued governmental and private payer pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing. changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers' pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability.
in the united states, the results of the november 2016 elections have generated uncertainty with respect to, and could result in, significant changes in legislation, regulation and government policy that could significantly impact our businesses and the health care and retail industries. there have been multiple attempts to repeal, amend or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the aca, which was enacted in 2010 to provide health insurance coverage to millions of previously uninsured americans through a combination of insurance market reforms, an expansion of medicaid, subsidies and health insurance mandates. even if the aca remains in effect, significant provisions of aca have not yet been finalized (e.g., nondiscrimination in health programs and activities and the excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage) and it is uncertain whether or in what form these provisions will be finalized. we cannot predict whether current or future efforts to repeal, amend or otherwise invalidate these laws and adopt new healthcare legislation will be successful, nor can we predict the impact that such a development would have on our business and operating results. future legislation or rulemaking or other regulatory actions or developments under the aca or otherwise could adversely impact the number of americans with health insurance and, consequently, prescription drug coverage, increase regulation of pharmacy services, result in changes to pharmacy reimbursement rates, and otherwise change the way we do business. we cannot predict the timing or impact of any future legislative, rulemaking or other regulatory actions, but any such actions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
a significant change in, or noncompliance with, governmental regulations and other legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and profitability.
we operate in complex, highly regulated environments in the united states and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations. businesses in our pharmaceutical wholesale division are subject to a range of regulations relating to such things as product margins, product traceability and the conditions under which products must be stored. our retail pharmacy and health and wellness services businesses are subject to numerous country, state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements for pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements. the regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: country and state registration and regulation of pharmacies and drug discount card programs; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including medicare and medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including hipaa; the aca or any successor thereto; laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the u.s. food and drug administration ("fda") and drug enforcement administration ("dea"), trade regulations including those of the u.s. federal trade commission, and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the consumer product safety commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell as well as our loyalty and drug discount card programs; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; laws against the
- 19 -
corporate practice of medicine; and foreign, national and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse and the practice of the profession of pharmacy. for example, in the united states the dea, fda and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. we are required to hold valid dea and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal, holding and distribution of controlled substances. the dea, fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. we are also governed by foreign, national and state laws of general applicability, including laws regulating matters of working conditions, health and safety and equal employment opportunity and other labor and employment matters as well as employee benefit, competition and antitrust matters. in addition, we could have significant exposure if we are found to have infringed another party's intellectual property rights.
changes in laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may alter the landscape in which we do business and may significantly affect our cost of doing business. the impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs and require significant capital expenditures. untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including:  suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the medicare and medicaid programs in the united states and the national health service in the united kingdom; loss of licenses; and significant fines or monetary penalties. any failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the united states or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
we could be adversely affected by product liability, product recall, personal injury or other health and safety issues.
we could be adversely impacted by the supply of defective or expired products, including the infiltration of counterfeit products into the supply chain, errors in re-labelling of products, product tampering, product recall and contamination or product mishandling issues. through our pharmacies and specialist packaging sites, we are also exposed to risks relating to the services we provide. errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals, including related counseling, and in the provision of other healthcare services could lead to serious injury or death. product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide. our healthcare clinics also increase our exposure to professional liability claims related to medical care. should a product or other liability issue arise, the coverage limits under our insurance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us may not be adequate to protect us against claims and judgments. we also may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future. we could suffer significant reputational damage and financial liability if we, or any affiliated entities, experience any of the foregoing health and safety issues or incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
we have significant outstanding debt; our debt and associated payment obligations could significantly increase in the future if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt.
we have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. as of august 31, 2017, we had approximately $13 billion of outstanding indebtedness, including short-term borrowings. our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including:
•   requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on our debt, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends;
•   making it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes;
•   reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industry and market conditions;
•   making us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business operations; and
- 20 -
•   exposing us to interest rate risk given that a portion of our debt obligations is at variable interest rates.
we may incur or assume significantly more debt in the future, including in connection with acquisitions, strategic investments or joint ventures. if we add new debt and do not retire existing debt, the risks described above could increase. we also could be adversely impacted by any failure to renew or replace, on terms acceptable to us or at all, existing funding arrangements when they expire, and any failure to satisfy applicable covenants.
our long-term debt obligations include covenants that may adversely affect our ability, and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, to incur certain secured indebtedness or engage in certain types of transactions. in addition, our existing credit agreements require us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed a certain level. our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. if we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. this could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition.
we could be adversely affected by downgrades to our credit ratings or disruptions in our ability to access well-functioning capital markets.
historically, we have relied on the public debt capital markets to fund portions of our capital investments and access to the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities as part of our working capital management strategy. our continued access to these markets, and the terms of such access, depend on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and our credit ratings. the major credit rating agencies have assigned us and our corporate debt investment grade credit ratings. these ratings are based on a number of factors, which include their assessment of our financial strength and financial policies. we benefit from investment grade ratings as they serve to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate our access to a variety of lenders and other creditors, including landlords for our leased stores, on terms that we consider advantageous to our businesses. however, there can be no assurance that any particular rating assigned to us will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency, if in that rating agency's judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. incurrence of additional debt by us could adversely affect our credit ratings. we depend on banks and other financial institutions to provide credit to our business and perform under our agreements with them. defaults by one or more of these counterparties on their obligations to us could materially and adversely affect us. any disruptions or turmoil in the capital markets or any downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets and increase the cost of and counterparty risks associated with existing facilities, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations.
we may be unable to keep existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places on favorable terms, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores. local land use and zoning regulations, environmental regulations and other regulatory requirements may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing, renovating and operating our stores. in addition, real estate, zoning, construction and other delays may adversely affect store openings and renovations and increase our costs. further, changing local demographics at existing store locations may adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores. the termination or expiration of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores. if we determine to close or relocate a store subject to a lease, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for the balance of the lease term. if we are unable to maintain our existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places and on favorable terms, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
as a holding company, walgreens boots alliance is dependent on funding from its operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and other obligations.
walgreens boots alliance is a holding company with no business operations of its own. its assets primarily consist of direct and indirect ownership interests in, and its business is conducted through, subsidiaries which are separate legal entities. as a result, it is dependent on funding from its subsidiaries, including walgreens and alliance boots, to meet its obligations. additionally, walgreens boots alliance's subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions to walgreens boots alliance, which may limit the payment of cash dividends or other distributions to the holders of walgreens boots alliance common stock. credit facilities and other debt obligations of walgreens boots alliance, as well as statutory provisions, may further limit the ability of walgreens boots alliance and its subsidiaries to pay dividends. payments to walgreens boots alliance by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon its subsidiaries' earnings and business considerations.

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly.
our operating results have historically varied on a quarterly basis and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. factors that may affect our quarterly operating results, some of which are beyond the control of management, include, but are not limited to the timing of the introduction of new generic and brand name prescription drugs; inflation, including with respect to generic drug procurement costs; the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season; changes in payer reimbursement rates and terms; fluctuations in inventory, energy, transportation, labor, healthcare and other costs; significant acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and other strategic initiatives; asset impairment charges; the relative magnitude of our lifo provision in any particular quarter; foreign currency fluctuations; seasonality; prolonged severe weather in key markets; and many of the other risk factors discussed herein. accordingly, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and investors should not rely on the results of any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance.
our businesses are seasonal in nature, and adverse events during the holiday and cough, cold and flu seasons could adversely impact our operating results.
our businesses are seasonal in nature, with the second fiscal quarter (december, january and february) typically generating a higher proportion of retail sales and earnings than other fiscal quarters. we purchase significant amounts of seasonal inventory in anticipation of the holiday season. adverse events, such as deteriorating economic conditions, higher unemployment, higher gas prices, public transportation disruptions, or unanticipated adverse weather, could result in lower-than-planned sales during key selling seasons. for example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms, windstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and increase our snow removal and other costs. this could lead to lower sales or to unanticipated markdowns, negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations. in addition, both prescription and non-prescription drug sales are affected by the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season, which can vary considerably from year to year.
we could be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters.
generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our businesses, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, equity method investments, vendor rebates and other vendor consideration, lease obligations, self-insurance liabilities, pension and postretirement benefits, tax matters, unclaimed property laws and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. for example, changes in accounting standards and the application of existing accounting standards particularly related to the measurement of fair value as compared to carrying value for the company's reporting units, including goodwill, intangible assets and investments in equity interests, including investments held by our equity method investees, may have an adverse effect on the company's financial condition and results of operations. factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include significant adverse changes in the business climate and declines in the financial condition of a reporting unit. factors that could lead to impairment of investments in equity interests of the companies in which we invested or the investments held by those companies include a prolonged period of decline in their operating performance or adverse changes in the economic, regulatory and legal environments of the countries in which they operate in.
new accounting guidance also may require systems and other changes that could increase our operating costs and/or significantly change our financial statements. for example, in february 2016, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") 2016-02, leases (topic 842), which supersedes topic 840, leases. this asu, which is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2018 (fiscal 2020), seeks to increase the transparency and comparability of organizations by recognizing operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. see, "new accounting pronouncements," within note 2, summary of major accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements. implementing this asu, as well as other new accounting guidance may require us to make significant upgrades to and investments in our lease administration systems and other accounting systems, and could result in significant adverse changes to our financial statements.
we have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets which could, in the future, become impaired and result in material non-cash charges to our results of operations.
- 22 -
as of august 31, 2017, we had $25.8 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets. we evaluate this goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. as part of this impairment analysis, we determine fair value for each reporting unit using both the income and market approaches. definite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. estimated fair values could change if, for example, there are changes in the business climate, changes in the competitive environment, adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments, changes in capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditure levels, operating cash flows, or market capitalization. because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could require material non-cash charges to our results of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
we are exposed to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings.
we operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment. we are involved in litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings and subject to investigations, inspections, audits, inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities arising in the course of our businesses, including those contained in note 11, commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k. legal proceedings, in general, and securities and class action litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. in addition, under the qui tam or "whistleblower" provisions of the federal and various state false claims acts, persons may bring lawsuits alleging that a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute or similar laws has resulted in the submission of "false" claims to federal and/or state healthcare programs, including medicare and medicaid. from time to time, we are also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust, tax, contract, intellectual property and other matters. we cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings do sometimes occur. as a result, we could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. the outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations. additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management's attention and resources.
we could be adversely affected by violations of anti-bribery, anti-corruption and/or international trade laws.
we are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business. for example, we are subject to the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (the "fcpa"), u.s. export control, anti-money laundering and trade sanction laws, and similar anti-corruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries, such as the u.k. bribery act, any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also harm our reputation. the fcpa generally prohibits u.s. companies and their officers, directors, employees, and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. the fcpa also requires that u.s. public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. if we are found to have violated the fcpa, or any other anti-bribery, anti-corruption or international trade laws, we may face sanctions including civil and criminal fines, disgorgement of profits, and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with governmental agencies or receive export licenses. in addition, new initiatives may be proposed from time to time that impact the trading conditions in certain countries or regions, and may include retaliatory duties or trade sanctions which, if enacted, could adversely impact our trading relationships with vendors or other parties in such locations and have a material adverse effect on our operations. from time to time, we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign governmental agencies relating to our international business activities, compliance with which could be costly and time-consuming, and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could damage our reputation and subject us to fines or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations.
we could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions.
we are a large corporation with operations in the united states and numerous other jurisdictions around the world. as such, we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the united states federal, state and local governments as well as various foreign jurisdictions. we compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. as the
- 23 -
tax rates vary among jurisdictions, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. any changes in corporate income tax laws or any implementation of tax laws relating to corporate tax reform, could significantly impact our overall tax liability. from time to time, legislative and regulatory initiatives are proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions, effective tax rate, tax payments or financial condition. in addition, tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations and any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities. any change in enacted tax laws, rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations, any adverse outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments and results of operations.
our insurance strategies may expose us to unexpected costs.
we use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers' compensation; automobile and general liability; property, director and officers' liability; and employee healthcare benefits. provisions for losses related to self-insured risks generally are based upon actuarially determined estimates. any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. substantial, unanticipated losses or liabilities, including those due to natural disasters or otherwise, as well as changes in legal claims, trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
we could be adversely impacted by changes in assumptions used in calculating pension assets and liabilities.
we operate certain defined benefit pension plans in the united kingdom, which were closed to new entrants in 2010, as well as smaller plans in other jurisdictions. the valuation of the pension plan's assets and liabilities depends in part on assumptions, which are primarily based on the financial markets as well as longevity and employee retention rates. this valuation is particularly sensitive to material changes in the value of equity, bond and other investments held by the pension plans, changes in the corporate bond yields which are used in the measurement of the liabilities, changes in market expectations for long-term price inflation, and new evidence on projected longevity rates. funding requirements and the impact on the statement of earnings relating to these pension plans are also influenced by these factors. adverse changes in the assumptions used to calculate the value of pension assets and liabilities, including lower than expected pension fund investment returns and/or increased life expectancy of plan participants, or regulatory change could require us to increase the funding of its defined benefit pension plans or incur higher expenses, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.
certain stockholders may have significant voting influence over matters requiring stockholder approval.
as of august 31, 2017, affiliates of stefano pessina, our executive vice chairman and chief executive officer (the "sp investors"), had sole or shared voting power, directly or indirectly, over an aggregate of approximately 14% of our outstanding common stock. the sp investors have agreed to, for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee for election to the board, to vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the board's recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of the company's stockholders (including with respect to the election of directors). the sp investors' significant interest in our common stock potentially could determine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote by our stockholders. the influence of the sp investors could result in the company taking actions that other stockholders do not support or failing to take actions that other stockholders support. as a result, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.
shares issued to former alliance boots stockholders in connection with our strategic combination with alliance boots are eligible for future sale.
the shares issued to the sp investors and certain other former alliance boots stockholders in connection with our strategic combination with alliance boots generally may now be sold pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"), subject to restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates and to certain obligations pursuant to a shareholders agreement (as amended, the "company shareholders agreement") with certain of the sp investors. in addition, the company shareholders agreement also contains registration rights that would obligate us, in certain instances, to file future registration statements under the securities act covering resales of shares issued to former alliance boots stockholders or to permit a "piggyback" on a future registration statement. a sale, or the perception that a sale may occur, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock.
conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also owners or directors of companies we may have dealings with.
- 24 -
conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, could arise between our interests and the interests of the other entities and business activities in which our directors or officers are involved. for example, potential conflicts of interest could arise if a dispute were to arise between the company and other parties to the company shareholders agreement, including the sp investors. mr. pessina, our executive vice chairman and chief executive officer, indirectly controls alliance santé participations s.a. ("asp"), a privately-held company which is a party to the company shareholders agreement, and he and his partner ornella barra, our co-chief operating officer, serve as directors of asp. similar issues could arise in connection with other transactions in the future. while our contractual arrangements place restrictions on the parties' conduct in certain situations, and related party transactions are subject to independent review and approval in accordance with our related party transaction approval procedures and applicable law, the potential for a conflict of interest exists and such persons may have conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, with respect to matters involving or affecting both companies.
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, delaware law and/or our agreements with certain stockholders may impede the ability of our stockholders to make changes to our board or impede a takeover.
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of the delaware general corporation law (the "dgcl"), could make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board or discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, consolidation, or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable. these provisions include the authorization of the issuance of "blank check" preferred stock that could be issued by the board, limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings, and advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. we are also subject to the provisions of section 203 of the dgcl, which prohibits us, except under specified circumstances, from engaging in any mergers, significant sales of stock or assets, or business combinations with any stockholder or group of stockholders who own 15% or more of our common stock.
under the company shareholders agreement, the sp investors are entitled to designate one nominee to the board (currently stefano pessina) for so long as the sp investors continue to meet certain beneficial ownership thresholds and subject to certain other conditions. pursuant to the company shareholders agreement, the sp investors have agreed that, for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee to the board, they will vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the board's recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders (including with respect to the election of directors).
while these provisions do not make us immune from takeovers or changes in the composition of the board, and are intended to protect our stockholders from, among other things, coercive or otherwise unfair tactics, these provisions could have the effect of making it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board or discouraging, delaying, or preventing a merger, consolidation, or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable. see also the risk factor captioned "certain stockholders may have significant voting influence over matters requiring stockholder approval" above.
the market price of our common stock may be volatile.
the market price of shares of our common stock may be volatile. broad general economic, political, market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of the shares, regardless of our actual operating performance. in addition to the other risk factors identified in this item 1a, factors that could cause fluctuations in the price of the shares include:
•   actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results and the results of competitors;
•   changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts that might cover us;
•   conditions or trends in the industry, including regulatory changes or changes in the securities marketplace;
•   announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures;
•   announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;
•   additions or departures of key personnel;
•   issuances or sales of our common stock, including sales of shares by our directors and officers or key investors, including the sp investors; and
•   various other market factors or perceived market factors, including rumors or speculation, whether or not correct, involving or affecting us or our industries, vendors, customers, strategic partners or competitors.
- 25 -
there are a number of additional business risks that could materially and adversely affect our businesses and financial results.
many other factors could materially and adversely affect our businesses and financial results, including:
•   if we are unsuccessful in establishing effective advertising, marketing and promotional programs, our sales or sales margins could be negatively affected.
•   our operating costs may be subject to increases outside the control of our businesses, whether due to inflation, new or increased taxes, adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in market conditions or otherwise.
•   our success depends on our ability to attract, engage and retain store, professional and management personnel, including in executive and other key strategic positions, and the loss of key personnel could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations, financial condition or cash flow.
•   natural disasters, civil unrest, severe weather conditions, terrorist activities, global political and economic developments, war, health epidemics or pandemics or the prospect of these events can interrupt or otherwise adversely impact our operations or damage our facilities or those of our strategic partners, vendors and customers and have an adverse impact on consumer confidence levels and spending on our products and services.
•   if we or our affiliates were to incur significant liabilities or expense relating to the protection of the environment, related health and safety matters, environmental remediation or compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
•   the long-term effects of climate change on general economic conditions and the pharmacy industry in particular are unclear, and changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy and the regulatory and other costs associated with energy production and delivery may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our businesses.
•   if negative publicity, even if unwarranted, related to safety or quality, human and workplace rights, or other issues damage our brand image and corporate reputation, or that of our vendors or strategic allies, our businesses may suffer.
item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein and the description of the company's business and reportable segments in item 1 above. this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements. factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements below and in risk factors in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k. references herein to the "company," "we," "us," or "our" refer to walgreens boots alliance, inc. and its subsidiaries from and after the effective time of the reorganization on december 31, 2014 and, prior to that time, to its predecessor walgreen co. and its subsidiaries, and in each case do not include unconsolidated partially-owned entities, except as otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires.
introduction on march 31, 2017, walgreens boots alliance and pharmacy benefit manager prime therapeutics llc closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company, alliancerx walgreens prime, as part of a strategic alliance. alliancerx walgreens prime is consolidated by walgreens boots alliance and reported within the retail pharmacy usa division in its financial statements. see note 6, acquisitions for further information.
on december 31, 2014, walgreens boots alliance became the successor of walgreens pursuant to a merger to effect a reorganization of walgreens into a holding company structure, with walgreens boots alliance becoming the parent holding company. pursuant to the reorganization, walgreens became a wholly owned subsidiary of walgreens boots alliance, which was formed for the purposes of the reorganization, and each issued and outstanding share of walgreens common stock converted on a one-to-one basis into walgreens boots alliance common stock. also on december 31, 2014, following the completion of the reorganization, walgreens boots alliance completed the acquisition of the remaining 55% of alliance boots gmbh ("alliance boots") that walgreens did not previously own (the "second step transaction") in exchange for £3.133 billion in cash and 144.3 million shares of walgreens boots alliance common stock. alliance boots became a consolidated subsidiary and ceased being accounted for under the equity method immediately upon completion of the second step transaction. for financial reporting and accounting purposes, walgreens boots alliance was the acquirer of alliance boots. the consolidated financial statements (and other data, such as prescriptions filled) reflect the results of operations and financial position of walgreens and its subsidiaries for periods prior to december 31, 2014 and of walgreens boots alliance and its subsidiaries for periods from and after the effective time of the reorganization on december 31, 2014.
in addition, we have undertaken a number of additional acquisitions, divestitures and strategic initiatives in recent years designed to grow our businesses and enhance our competitive position. please refer to note 3, exit and disposal activities, note 5, equity method investments and note 6, acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 below for additional information.
terminated acquisition of rite aid corporation ("rite aid") and related matters on october 27, 2015, walgreens boots alliance entered into an agreement and plan of merger with rite aid and victoria merger sub, inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of walgreens boots alliance (as amended as described below, the "merger agreement"), pursuant to which the company agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to acquire rite aid, a drugstore chain in the united states. the merger agreement was amended by amendment no. 1 thereto on january 29, 2017.
in connection with regulatory review of the merger contemplated by the merger agreement, on december 20, 2016, walgreens boots alliance and rite aid announced that they had entered into an agreement (the "fred's asset purchase agreement"), subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to sell certain rite aid stores and certain assets related to store operations to fred's, inc. ("fred's") for $950 million in an all-cash transaction. the transaction was subject to the approval and completion of the acquisition of rite aid by walgreens boots alliance pursuant to the merger agreement.
on june 28, 2017, walgreens boots alliance and rite aid entered into a mutual termination agreement (the "termination agreement") pursuant to which the parties agreed to terminate the merger agreement, including all schedules and exhibits thereto, and all ancillary agreements contemplated thereby, or entered pursuant thereto (other than as expressly specified) (collectively with the merger agreement, the "transaction documents"), effective as of june 28, 2017. pursuant to the termination agreement, the company paid rite aid the termination fee of $325 million, in full satisfaction of any amounts required to be paid by the company under the merger agreement and other transaction documents. the parties also agreed to release each other from, among other things, any and all liability, claims, rights, actions, causes of action, damages, expenses and fees, however arising, in connection with, arising out of or related to the transaction documents, the transactions contemplated therein or thereby or certain related matters.
- 33 -
on june 28, 2017, following the termination of the merger agreement, the fred's asset purchase agreement was terminated. in connection with the termination of the fred's asset purchase agreement, the company reimbursed $25 million of fred's transaction costs in full satisfaction of any amounts required to be paid by the company under the fred's asset purchase agreement.
see note 8, borrowings to the consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to the termination of the merger agreement and related matters.
acquisition of certain rite aid assets on june 28, 2017, the company entered into an asset purchase agreement (the "asset purchase agreement") with rite aid, pursuant to which the company agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to acquire 2,186 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from rite aid.
on september 19, 2017, the company announced it had secured regulatory clearance for an amended and restated asset purchase agreement (the "amended and restated asset purchase agreement") to purchase 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from rite aid for $4.375 billion in cash and other consideration. as of the date of this report, the first few rite aid stores have been acquired. ownership of stores is expected to be transferred in phases, with the goal being to complete the store transfers in spring 2018. these transfers remain subject to closing conditions set forth in the amended and restated asset purchase agreement.
the company expects to complete integration of the acquired stores and related assets within the next three years, at an estimated cost of approximately $750 million, which will be reported as acquisition-related costs. in addition, the company plans to spend approximately $500 million of capital on store conversions and related activities. the company intends to treat charges related to acquisition integration activities as special items impacting comparability of results in its quarterly earnings disclosures.
the company expects to realize annual synergies from the transaction of more than $300 million, which are expected to be fully realized within four years of the initial closing of this transaction and derived primarily from procurement, cost savings and other operational matters.
the amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. the actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. see "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" below.
exit and disposal activities store optimization program on october 24, 2017, the company's board of directors approved a plan to implement a program (the "store optimization program") as part of an initiative to optimize store locations within the company's retail pharmacy usa division upon completion of the acquisition of certain stores and related assets from rite aid. the store optimization program includes plans to close approximately 600 stores across the u.s. and is expected to result in cost savings of $300 million per year to be delivered by the end of fiscal 2020. the actions under the store optimization program are expected to take place over an 18 month period beginning in spring 2018.
the company currently estimates that it will recognize cumulative pre-tax charges to its gaap financial results of approximately $450 million, including costs associated with lease obligations and other real estate costs, employee severance and other exit costs. the company expects to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $270 million for lease obligations and other real estate costs and approximately $180 million for employee severance and other exit costs. the company estimates that substantially all of these cumulative pre-tax charges will result in future cash expenditures.
as the store optimization program is implemented, charges will be recognized as the costs are incurred over time in accordance with gaap. the company intends to treat charges related to the store optimization program as special items impacting comparability of results in its quarterly earnings disclosures.
the amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. the actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. see "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" below.
cost transformation program on april 8, 2015, the walgreens boots alliance board of directors approved a plan to implement a restructuring program (the "cost transformation program") as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. the cost
- 34 -
transformation program implemented and built on the planned three-year, $1.0 billion cost-reduction initiative previously announced by walgreens on august 6, 2014 and included a number of elements designed to help achieve profitable growth through increased cost efficiencies. in april 2015, the company announced that it had identified additional opportunities for cost savings that increased the total expected cost savings of the cost transformation program by $500 million to a targeted $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2017, with significant areas of focus including plans to close approximately 200 stores across the u.s.; reorganize divisional and field operations; drive operating efficiencies; and streamline information technology and other functions. the actions under the cost transformation program focused primarily on our retail pharmacy usa segment. the company achieved $1.5 billion in savings from its previously announced cost transformation program ahead of schedule. as announced in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the company expected to close a total of approximately 260 stores.
the company completed the cost transformation program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, and over the duration of the program, 255 stores were closed. full program benefits will be recognized in subsequent periods. the company recognized cumulative pre-tax charges to our financial results in accordance with gaap of $1.8 billion. these charges included $743 million for asset impairment charges relating primarily to asset write-offs from store closures, information technology, inventory and other non-operational real estate asset write-offs; $665 million for real estate costs, including lease obligations (net of estimated sublease income); and $393 million for employee severance and other business transition and exit costs. the company estimates that approximately 60% of the cumulative pre-tax charges will result in cash expenditures over time, primarily related to historical and future lease and other real estate payments and employee separation costs. see note 3, exit and disposal activities, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. the actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. see "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" below.
comparability as a result of the completion of the second step transaction on december 31, 2014, there are a number of items that affect comparability of reported results. prior to december 31, 2014, our operations were within one reportable segment that included the results of the retail pharmacy usa division and corporate costs, along with the fully consolidated results of walgreens boots alliance development gmbh ("wbad"), a global sourcing enterprise formed by walgreens and alliance boots, and equity earnings from alliance boots. following the completion of the reorganization and the second step transaction on december 31, 2014, we report results in three segments. segmental reporting includes the allocation of procurement benefits, including wbad's results, and the combined corporate costs for periods subsequent to december 31, 2014. we have determined that it is impracticable to allocate historical results to the current segmental presentation. accordingly, our retail pharmacy usa segment results for fiscal 2015 for months prior to december 31, 2014 include all corporate costs of walgreens, the full consolidated results of wbad and equity income from walgreens' pre-merger 45% interest in alliance boots.
the completion of the second step transaction on december 31, 2014 also means that results for the twelve month periods ended august 31, 2017 and 2016 include the results of alliance boots on a fully consolidated basis, while the twelve month period ended august 31, 2015 includes the results of alliance boots for eight months (january through august 2015) on a fully consolidated basis and as equity income from walgreens' pre-merger 45% interest in alliance boots for four months (september through december 2014).
twelve month period-over-period comparisons of results require consideration of the foregoing factors and are not directly comparable.
in addition, our sales results are affected by a number of factors, including our sales performance during holiday periods and during the cough, cold and flu season; foreign currency fluctuations; significant weather conditions; timing of our own or competitor discount programs and pricing actions; levels of reimbursement from governmental agencies and other third party payers; and general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate.
amerisourcebergen corporation relationship in march 2013, walgreens, alliance boots and amerisourcebergen announced various agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between walgreens and amerisourcebergen pursuant to which branded and generic pharmaceutical products are sourced from amerisourcebergen in the united states and an agreement which provides amerisourcebergen the ability to access generics pharmaceutical products through wbad. in may 2016, certain of these agreements were extended for three years to now expire in 2026.
in addition, in march 2013, walgreens, alliance boots and amerisourcebergen entered into agreements and arrangements pursuant to which we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in amerisourcebergen over time through open market purchases and pursuant to warrants to acquire amerisourcebergen common stock and gain

associated representation on amerisourcebergen's board of directors in certain circumstances. please refer to our form 8-k filed on march 20, 2013 for more detailed information regarding these agreements and arrangements.
on march 18, 2016, we exercised warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of amerisourcebergen common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.17 billion. on august 25, 2016, we exercised additional warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of amerisourcebergen common stock at an exercise price of $52.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.19 billion. as of august 31, 2017, we owned 56,854,867 amerisourcebergen common shares representing approximately 26% of the outstanding amerisourcebergen common stock and had designated one member of amerisourcebergen's board of directors. as of august 31, 2017, we can acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 amerisourcebergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another member of amerisourcebergen's board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements. the amount of permitted open market purchases is subject to increase or decrease in certain circumstances.
effective march 18, 2016, we began accounting for our investment in amerisourcebergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag, with the net earnings attributable to our investment being classified within the operating income of our pharmaceutical wholesale segment. see note 5, equity method investments, to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information. due to the march 18, 2016 effective date and the two-month reporting lag, our results for the 12 month period ended august 31, 2016 include approximately three and a half months of equity method income relating to our investment in amerisourcebergen. similarly, our results for the 12 month period ended august 31, 2017 include approximately ten and a half months of equity income reflecting our increased ownership following the exercise on august 25, 2016 of the second tranche of warrants.
recent hurricanes the company currently estimates that it will recognize cumulative pre-tax charges to its fiscal 2018 gaap financial results of approximately $90 million for the cost of storm damages and store closures. the majority of these charges will be incurred in puerto rico. the company intends to treat these charges as special items impacting comparability of results in its quarterly earnings disclosures.
the amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. the actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. see "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" below.

walgreens boots alliance results of operations fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
fiscal 2017 net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance decreased 2.3 percent to $4.1 billion, while diluted net earnings per share decreased 1.0 percent to $3.78 compared with the prior year. the decreases reflect rite aid related costs, the phasing of the company's cost transformation program and the impact in the prior year of the change in accounting method for our investment in amerisourcebergen, largely offset by the reduction in the fair value of the company's amerisourcebergen warrants, improvements in selling, general and administration expenses before cost transformation expenses and a lower effective tax rate.
other expense for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 was $11 million and $261 million, respectively. in fiscal 2016 the change in fair value of our amerisourcebergen warrants resulted in a loss of $517 million, and additionally, we recognized income of $268 million related to the change in accounting method for our investment in amerisourcebergen.
interest was a net expense of $693 million and $596 million in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. the increase mainly reflects the prefunded acquisition financing costs relating to the rite aid transaction.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 and 2016 was 15.7% and 19.4%, respectively. the net decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to changes in the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings, favorable changes in permanent differences between our financial statement earnings and taxable profits as well as incremental discrete tax benefits. our mix of pre-tax earnings was notably impacted by our cost transformation program and costs associated with the termination of the rite aid merger agreement, both of which reduced our u.s. pre-tax earnings. for fiscal 2017, net discrete tax benefits resulted primarily from deferred tax benefits related to a change in the u.k. tax rate, adopting asu 2016-09 and net tax benefits associated with prior tax years.
adjusted diluted net earnings per share (non-gaap measure) fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
adjusted net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance in fiscal 2017 increased 9.9 percent to $5.5 billion compared with the prior year. adjusted diluted net earnings per share in fiscal 2017 increased 11.1 percent to $5.10 compared with the prior year. adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by 1.7 percentage points and 1.8 percentage points, respectively, as a result of currency translation.
excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase in equity earnings from amerisourcebergen and a lower effective tax rate. see "--non-gaap measures" below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure.

fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
fiscal 2016 net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance decreased 1.1 percent to $4.2 billion, while diluted net earnings per share decreased 4.5 percent to $3.82 compared with the prior year. the decreases reflect fluctuations in the fair value adjustments of the company's amerisourcebergen warrants and the prior year gain on the previously held equity interest in alliance boots, which was largely offset by the inclusion of alliance boots consolidated results for the entire period and an increase in operating income at retail pharmacy usa.
other income (expense) for fiscal 2016 was an expense of $261 million as compared to income of $685 million in fiscal 2015. the change in fair value of our amerisourcebergen warrants, excluding deferred income amortization, resulted in a loss of $546 million for fiscal 2016, as compared to income of $759 million for fiscal 2015. additionally, we recognized income of $268 million for fiscal 2016 related to the change in accounting method for our investment in amerisourcebergen.
interest was a net expense of $596 million and $605 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. fiscal 2016 included interest expense on notes issued during june 2016. fiscal 2015 included interest expense of $99 million related to the repayment of a portion of our long-term debt in advance of its maturity.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 and 2015 was 19.4% and 19.9%, respectively. the net decrease in the effective tax rate is attributable to several factors. first, our fiscal 2016 effective tax rate benefited from having a full-year of foreign sourced pre-tax earnings taxed at lower rates as compared to fiscal 2015, when the company had only eight months of those earnings after the second step transaction. further, in fiscal 2016 our domestic pre-tax earnings were reduced as a result of the amerisourcebergen warrants then held by the company. in addition, during fiscal 2016 the company benefited from enacted tax law changes (tax rate reductions) in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions, most notably the united kingdom, which generated a $178 million tax benefit. the company also had fewer non-deductible expenses in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.  these items were partly offset by the facts that in fiscal 2015 the company had a non-taxable gain on its previously held equity investment in alliance boots and recognized the benefit of a capital loss deferred tax asset, neither of which recurred in fiscal 2016.
adjusted diluted net earnings per share (non-gaap measure) fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
adjusted net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance in fiscal 2016 increased 22.6 percent to $5.0 billion compared with the prior year. adjusted diluted net earnings per share in the fiscal year increased 18.3 percent to $4.59 compared with the prior year. the increase in adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to inclusion of alliance boots consolidated results for the entire period and an increase in operating income at retail pharmacy usa. see "--non-gaap measures" below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure.
results of operations by segment retail pharmacy usa as a result of the completion of the second step transaction, the company ceased recording equity earnings in alliance boots as of december 31, 2014. as such, the fiscal year ended august 31, 2015 includes equity income from walgreens' pre-merger 45% interest in alliance boots for four months (september through december 2014).

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were $3.3 billion (including $1.8 billion in non-u.s. jurisdictions) as of august 31, 2017, compared to $9.8 billion (including $1.6 billion in non-u.s. jurisdictions) at august 31, 2016. short-term investment objectives are primarily to minimize risk and maintain liquidity. to attain these objectives, investment limits are placed on the amount, type and issuer of securities. investments are principally in u.s. treasury money market funds and aaa-rated money market funds.
our long-term capital policy is to maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, reinvest in our core strategies, invest in strategic opportunities that reinforce our core strategies and meet return requirements, and return surplus cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the long term.
cash provided by operations and the issuance of debt are the principal sources of funds for expansion, investments, acquisitions, remodeling programs, dividends to stockholders and stock repurchases. net cash provided by operating activities was $7.3 billion in fiscal 2017 compared to $7.8 billion in fiscal 2016 and $5.7 billion in fiscal 2015. the $596 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to lower cash inflows from changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities and accounts receivable, net partially offset by higher cash inflows from changes in inventories. decreases in cash inflows on accrued expenses and other liabilities resulted primarily from the timing and payment of expense related accruals. decreases in cash inflows on accounts receivable, net are primarily due to the timing of collections in retail pharmacy usa. increases in cash inflows on inventories resulted primarily from retail pharmacy usa inventory management initiatives related to simplified retail product offering, promotional efficiencies and lower brand name drug inflation.
net cash used for investing activities was $0.8 billion in fiscal 2017 compared to $3.5 billion in fiscal 2016 and $4.3 billion in fiscal 2015. business acquisitions in fiscal 2017 were $88 million compared to $126 million for the year-ago period. business acquisitions in the current year primarily relate to the purchase of prescription files. business acquisitions in the comparable prior year period include the acquisition of an international beauty brand and prescription files. fiscal 2016 also included an investment in amerisourcebergen of $2.4 billion as a result of the exercise of warrants.
additions to property, plant and equipment in fiscal 2017 were $1.4 billion compared to $1.3 billion in fiscal 2016 and $1.3 billion in fiscal 2015. capital expenditures by reporting segment were as follows:

1   our retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale segments were acquired as part of the second step transaction in which we acquired the 55% of alliance boots that we did not already own on december 31, 2014. as a result of the timing of the acquisition, only eight months of capital expenditures (january through august 2015) were reported for these divisions in fiscal 2015.
significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 primarily relate to investments in our stores and information technology projects.

additionally, investing activities for fiscal 2017 included proceeds related to sale leaseback transactions of $444 million, compared to $60 million in the comparable prior year period.
net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2017 was $12.9 billion compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $2.6 billion in fiscal 2016. net cash used for financing activities was $0.9 billion in fiscal 2015. we repurchased shares as part of the $1 billion and $5 billion stock repurchase programs described below and to support the needs of the employee stock plans totaling $457 million in fiscal 2017, compared to $1.0 billion in fiscal 2016 and $500 million in fiscal 2015. proceeds related to employee stock plans were $217 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $235 million in fiscal 2016 and $503 million in fiscal 2015. cash dividends paid were $1.7 billion in fiscal 2017 compared to $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. in fiscal 2017, there were no public debt offerings compared to $6 billion proceeds received from u.s. dollar denominated debt in fiscal 2016 (described below). we currently intend to continue to maintain a long-term dividend payout ratio target of approximately 30 to 35 percent of adjusted net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance.
we believe that cash flow from operations, availability under our existing credit facilities and arrangements, current cash and investment balances and our ability to obtain other financing, if necessary, will provide adequate cash funds for our foreseeable working capital needs, capital expenditures at existing facilities, acquisitions (including the acquisition of rite aid assets), dividend payments and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. our cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. the timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that we may complete may also impact our cash requirements.
see item 7a (qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk) below for a discussion of certain financing and market risks.

on february 1, 2017, walgreens boots alliance entered into a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility (as amended, the "february 2017 revolving credit agreement") with the lenders from time to time party thereto and, on august 1, 2017, walgreens boots alliance entered into an amendment agreement thereto. the terms and conditions of the february 2017 revolving credit agreement were unchanged by the amendment other than the extension of the facility termination date to the earlier of (a) january 31, 2019 and (b) the date of termination in whole of the aggregate commitments provided by the lenders thereunder. borrowings under the february 2017 revolving credit agreement will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at walgreens boots alliance's option, the alternate base rate or the reserve adjusted eurocurrency rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin calculated based on walgreens boots alliance's credit ratings. in connection with the february 2017 revolving credit agreement, walgreens boots alliance paid upfront fees of $0.5 million and additional extension fees of $0.5 million in respect of the amendment to the february 2017 revolving credit agreement. in addition, walgreens boots alliance
- 49 -
has agreed to pay to the lenders under the february 2017 revolving credit agreement certain customary fees. as of august 31, 2017, there were no borrowings under the february 2017 revolving credit agreement.
on august 24, 2017, walgreens boots alliance entered into a $1.0 billion revolving credit agreement (the "august 2017 revolving credit agreement") with the lenders from time to time party thereto and a $1.0 billion term loan credit agreement (the "2017 term loan credit agreement" and together with the august 2017 revolving credit agreement, the "august 2017 credit agreements") with sumitomo mitsui banking corporation. the august 2017 revolving credit agreement is an unsecured revolving credit facility with a facility termination date of the earlier of (a) january 31, 2019, subject to any extension thereof pursuant to the terms of the august 2017 revolving credit agreement and (b) the date of termination in whole of the aggregate commitments provided by the lenders thereunder. the 2017 term loan credit agreement is an unsecured "multi-draw" term loan facility maturing on march 30, 2019. the aggregate commitments of sumitomo mitsui banking corporation under the 2017 term loan credit agreement are initially equal to $1.0 billion, which shall be reduced on june 1, 2018 to the lesser of $500 million and the aggregate remaining undrawn commitments thereunder. any remaining undrawn commitments thereunder and the ability of walgreens boots alliance to request loans under such commitments shall terminate on september 1, 2018.
borrowings under the august 2017 credit agreements will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at walgreens boots alliance's option, the alternate base rate or the eurocurrency rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin calculated based on walgreens boots alliance's credit ratings. upfront fees paid to date in connection with the august 2017 credit agreements totaled $1.25 million. in addition, walgreens boots alliance has agreed to pay to the lenders under the august 2017 credit agreements certain customary fees. as of august 31, 2017, there were no borrowings under either of the august 2017 credit agreements.
debt covenants each of the company's credit facilities described above contain a covenant to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed 0.60:1.00. the credit facilities contain various other customary covenants. in the case of the 2017 term loan credit agreement, such covenants are only effective after the date of initial funding. as of august 31, 2017, the company was in compliance with all such applicable covenants.
terminated rite aid transaction in connection with the merger agreement with rite aid, which was terminated on june 28, 2017, we entered into various financing arrangements and facilities, none of which were drawn upon and all of which have been terminated. see note 8, borrowings to the consolidated financial statements.
as described above, because the merger with rite aid was not consummated on or prior to june 1, 2017, the 2018 notes, the 2021 notes and the 2023 notes issued on june 1, 2016 were redeemed on june 5, 2017 under the special mandatory redemption terms of the indenture governing such notes. walgreens boots alliance was required to redeem all of such notes then outstanding, at a special mandatory redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest of approximately $1 million to, but excluding, the date of redemption.
pursuant to the termination agreement, the company paid rite aid the termination fee of $325 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, in full satisfaction of any amounts required to be paid by the company under the merger agreement and other transaction documents. in connection with the termination of the fred's asset purchase agreement, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the company reimbursed $25 million of fred's transaction costs in full satisfaction of any amounts required to be paid by the company under the fred's asset purchase agreement.

amerisourcebergen relationship pursuant to our arrangements with amerisourcebergen, we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in amerisourcebergen over time as described under "--amerisourcebergen corporation relationship" above. as of august 31, 2017, the company owned 56,854,867 amerisourcebergen common shares representing approximately 26% of the outstanding amerisourcebergen common stock. this includes a total of approximately 11.5 million shares of amerisourcebergen that we purchased in the open market. subject to applicable legal and contractual requirements, share purchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions or pursuant to instruments and plans complying with rule 10b5-1.
on march 18, 2016, we exercised warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of amerisourcebergen common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.17 billion. on august 25, 2016, we exercised additional warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of amerisourcebergen common stock at an exercise price of $52.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.19 billion. the transactions were funded using existing cash on hand. see note 5, equity method investments, to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further information.
commitments and contingencies the information set forth in note 11, commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k is incorporated herein by reference.
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and include amounts based on management's prudent judgments and estimates. actual results may differ from these estimates. management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. to the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the statement of earnings and corresponding balance sheet accounts would be necessary. these adjustments would be made in future periods. some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes. we use the following methods to determine our estimates:
business combinations - we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. the determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.
for intangible assets, we generally use the income approach to determine fair value. the income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: discount rates, terminal growth rates, royalty rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. the discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections.
although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired.
judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset's useful life.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment - goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. as part of our impairment analysis for each reporting unit, we determine fair value for each reporting unit. this determination includes estimating the fair value using both the income and market approaches. the income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. the market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping.
- 51 -
the determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, discount rates, terminal growth rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both.
we also compared the sum of the estimated fair values of the reporting units to the company's fair value as implied by the market value of the company's equity and debt securities. this comparison indicated that, in total, our assumptions and estimates were reasonable. however, future declines in the overall market value of the company's equity securities may indicate that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.
our reporting units' fair values exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 9% to more than 400%. due to the negative impact of reductions in pharmacy funding in the united kingdom, the fair value of our boots reporting unit, within our retail pharmacy international division, was impacted and is in excess of its carrying value by approximately 9%. the goodwill of the boots reporting unit is not currently impaired and we will continue to monitor the u.k. industry trends and the impact it may have on the business. see note 7, goodwill and other intangible assets, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
our indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value is estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. these estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, availability of market information as well as our profitability.
cost of sales and inventory - cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and services sold, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence, manufacturing costs, certain direct product design and development costs and supplier rebates. in addition to product costs, cost of sales includes manufacturing costs, warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts and vendor allowances. cost of sales for our retail pharmacy usa segment is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts. inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the last-in, first-out ("lifo") method for the retail pharmacy usa segment and primarily on a first-in first-out ("fifo") basis for inventory in the retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale segments.
equity method investments  - we use the equity method to account for investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. our proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings. judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material purchase and sale transactions.
we evaluate equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. factors considered when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost, the investee's financial condition and near-term prospects, and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. an impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified.
pension and postretirement benefits - we have various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of our foreign employees. we also have postretirement healthcare plans that cover qualifying domestic employees. eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans varies depending on participants' status, date of hire and or length of service. our pension and postretirement expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating those amounts. these assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term rate of return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. in determining our long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, we consider both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the long-term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio. a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on our projected benefit obligation and pension expense. a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline of $389 million to our pension benefit
- 52 -
obligation. a 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase our pension expense by $22 million.
our policy is to fund our pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. our postretirement healthcare plans are not funded.
income taxes - we are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. u.s. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. in evaluating the tax benefits associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. adjustments are made to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we determine the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is primarily included in other long-term liabilities and current income taxes on our consolidated balance sheets and in income tax provision in our consolidated statements of earnings.
in determining our provision for income taxes, we use income, permanent differences between book and tax income and enacted statutory income tax rates. the provision for income taxes rate also reflects our assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreign-based income deemed to be taxable in the united states. discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.

item 1a. risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form 10-k, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating t-mobile. our business, financial condition, liquidity, or operating results, as well as the price of our common stock and other securities, could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.
risks related to our business and the wireless industry competition, industry consolidation, and changes in the market for wireless services could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain customers and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.
we have multiple wireless competitors, some of which have greater resources than us and compete for customers based principally on service/device offerings; price; network coverage, speed and quality; and customer service. we expect market saturation to continue to cause the wireless industry's customer growth rate to be moderate in comparison with historical growth rates, or possibly negative, leading to ongoing competition for customers. we also expect that our customers' appetite for data services will place increasing demands on our network capacity. this competition and our capacity will continue to put pressure on pricing and margins as companies compete for potential customers. our ability to compete will depend on, among other things, continued absolute and relative improvement in network quality and customer service, effective marketing and selling of products and services, innovation, attractive pricing, and cost management, all of which will involve significant expenses.
joint ventures, mergers, acquisitions and strategic alliances in the wireless sector have resulted in and are expected to result in larger competitors competing for a limited number of customers. the two largest national wireless communication providers currently serve a significant percentage of all wireless customers and hold significant spectrum and other resources. our largest competitors may be able to enter into exclusive handset, device, or content arrangements, execute pervasive advertising and marketing campaigns, or otherwise improve their cost position relative to ours. in addition, refusal of our large competitors to provide critical access to resources and inputs, such as roaming services on reasonable terms, could improve their position within the wireless broadband mobile services industry.
we face intense and increasing competition from other service providers as industry sectors converge, such as cable, telecom services and content, satellite, and other service providers. companies like comcast and at&t (and at&t's proposed acquisition of time warner, inc.) will have the scale and assets to aggressively compete in a converging industry. verizon, through the acquisitions of aol, inc. and yahoo! inc. is also a significant competitor focusing on premium content offerings to diversify outside of core wireless. further, some of our competitors now provide content services in addition to voice and
9
broadband services, and consumers are increasingly accessing video content from internet-based providers and applications, all of which create increased competition in this area. these factors, together with the effects of the increasing aggregate penetration of wireless services in all metropolitan areas and the ability of our larger competitors to use resources to build out their networks and to quickly deploy advanced technologies, could make it more difficult for us to continue to attract and retain customers, and may adversely affect our competitive position and ability to grow, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
the scarcity and cost of additional wireless spectrum, and regulations relating to spectrum use, may adversely affect our business strategy and financial condition and operating results.
we will need to acquire additional spectrum in order to continue our customer growth, expand and deepen our coverage, maintain our quality of service, meet increasing customer demands and deploy new technologies. we will be at a competitive disadvantage and possibly experience erosion in the quality of service in certain markets if we fail to gain access to necessary spectrum before reaching network capacity. as a result, we are actively seeking to make additional investment in spectrum, which could be significant.
the continued interest in, and acquisition of, spectrum by existing carriers and others may reduce our ability to acquire and/or increase the cost of acquiring spectrum in the secondary market or negatively impact our ability to gain access to spectrum through other means, including government auctions. we may need to enter into spectrum sharing or leasing arrangements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and may involve significant expenditures. gaining access to the spectrum we won in the fcc 600 mhz auction in 2017 may take up to three years or more. any material delay could adversely impact our ability to implement our plans and efforts to improve our network. in addition, our return on investment in spectrum depends on our ability to attract additional customers and to provide additional services and usage to existing customers. as a result, the return on any investment in spectrum that we make may not be as much as we anticipate or take longer than expected. additionally, we may be unable to secure the spectrum we need in any auction we may elect to participate in or in the secondary market, on favorable terms or at all.
the fcc may impose conditions on the use of new wireless broadband mobile spectrum that may negatively impact our ability to obtain spectrum economically or in appropriate configurations or coverage areas. additional conditions that may be imposed by the fcc include heightened build-out requirements, limited license terms or renewal rights, and clearing obligations that may make it less attractive or less economical to acquire spectrum. in addition, rules may be established for future government spectrum auctions that may negatively impact our ability to obtain spectrum economically or in appropriate configurations or coverage areas.
if we cannot acquire needed spectrum from the government or otherwise, if competitors acquire spectrum that will allow them to provide services competitive with our services, or if we cannot deploy services over acquired spectrum on a timely basis without burdensome conditions, at reasonable cost, and while maintaining network quality levels, then our ability to attract and retain customers and our associated financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.
if we are unable to take advantage of technological developments on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in demand for our services or face challenges in implementing or evolving our business strategy.
significant technological changes continue to impact the communications industry. in general, these technological changes enhance communications and enable a broader array of companies to offer services competitive with ours. in order to grow and remain competitive with new and evolving technologies in our industry, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, continually invest in our network, enhance our existing offerings, and introduce new offerings to address our current and potential customers' changing demands. enhancing our network, such as deploying 5g, is subject to risk from equipment changes and migration of customers from existing spectrum bands and the potential inability to secure spectrum necessary to deploy advanced technologies. adopting new and sophisticated technologies may result in implementation issues such as scheduling and supplier delays, unexpected or increased costs, technological constraints, regulatory permitting issues, customer dissatisfaction, and other issues that could cause delays in launching new technological capabilities, which in turn could result in significant costs or reduce the anticipated benefits of the upgrades. in general, the development of new services in the wireless telecommunications industry will require us to anticipate and respond to the continuously changing demands of our customers, which we may not be able to do accurately or timely. if our new services fail to retain or gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with these services are higher than anticipated, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
10
we could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches, whether directly or by way of third parties.
our business, like that of most retailers and wireless companies, involves the receipt, storage, and transmission of confidential information, including sensitive personal information and payment card information, confidential information about our employees and suppliers, and other sensitive information about our company, such as our business plans, transactions and intellectual property ("confidential information"). unauthorized access to confidential information may be difficult to anticipate, detect, or prevent, particularly given that the methods of unauthorized access constantly change and evolve. we may experience unauthorized access or distribution of confidential information by third parties or employees, errors or breaches by third party suppliers, or other breaches of security that compromise the integrity of confidential information, and such breaches can have a materially adverse effect on our business or damage our reputation.
cyber-attacks, such as denial of service and other malicious attacks, could disrupt our internal systems and applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers, and have other adverse effects on our business and that of others who depend on our services. as a telecommunications carrier, we are considered a critical infrastructure provider and therefore may be more likely to be the target of such attacks. such attacks against companies may be perpetrated by a variety of groups or persons, including those in jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are ineffective or unavailable, and such attacks may even be perpetrated by or at the behest of foreign governments.
in addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third-party service providers when it is necessary to pursue business objectives. we and our third-party service providers have been subject to unauthorized access to confidential information in the past, including a breach at one of our credit check providers in september 2015 in which a subset of records containing current and potential customer information was compromised by an external party.
our procedures and safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and to defend against attacks seeking to disrupt our services must be continually evaluated and revised to address the ever-evolving threat landscape. we cannot make assurances that all preventive actions taken will adequately repel a significant attack or prevent information security breaches or the misuses of data, unauthorized access by third parties or employees, or exploits against third-party supplier environments. if we are subject to such attacks or security breaches, we may incur significant costs, be subject to regulatory investigations, sanctions and private litigation, experience disruptions to our operations or suffer damage to our reputation. any future cyber-attacks or security breaches may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.
system failures and business disruptions may allow unauthorized use of or interference with our network and other systems which could be materially adversely affect our reputation and financial condition.
to be successful, we must provide our customers with reliable, trustworthy service and protect the communications, location, and personal information shared or generated by our customers. we rely upon both our systems and networks and the systems and networks of other providers and suppliers to provide and support our services and, in some cases, protect our customers' information and our information. failure of our or others' systems, networks, or infrastructure may prevent us from providing reliable service or may allow for the unauthorized use of or interference with our networks and other systems or for the compromise of customer information. examples of these risks include:
•   human error such as responding to deceptive communications or unintentionally executing malicious code;
•   physical damage, power surges or outages, or equipment failure, including those as a result of severe weather, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, political instability and volatility, and acts of war;
•   theft of customer and/or proprietary information offered for sale for competitive advantage or corporate extortion;
•   unauthorized access to our it and business systems or to our network and critical infrastructure and those of our suppliers and other providers;
•   supplier failures or delays; and
•   system failures or outages of our business systems or communications network.
such events could cause us to lose customers, lose revenue, incur expenses, suffer reputational damage, and subject us to litigation or governmental investigation. remediation costs could include liability for information loss, repairing infrastructure and systems, and/or costs of incentives offered to customers. our insurance may not cover, or be adequate to fully reimburse us for, costs and losses associated with such events.
11
we are in the process of implementing a new billing system, which will support a portion of our subscribers, while maintaining our legacy billing system. any unanticipated difficulties, disruption, or significant delays could have adverse operational, financial, and reputational effects on our business.
we are currently implementing a new customer billing system, which involves a new third-party supported platform and utilization of a phased deployment approach. post implementation, we plan to operate both the existing and new billing systems in parallel to aid in the transition to the new system until all phases of the conversion are complete.
the implementation may cause major system or business disruptions, or we may fail to implement the new billing system in a timely or effective manner. in addition, the third-party billing services supporting vendor may experience errors, cyber-attacks, or other operational disruptions that could negatively impact us and over which we may have limited control. interruptions and/or failure of this new billing services system could disrupt our operations and impact our ability to provide or bill for our services, retain customers, attract new customers, or negatively impact overall customer experience. any occurrence of the foregoing could cause material adverse effects on our operations and financial condition, material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and reputational damage.
we rely on third parties to provide products or services for the operation of our business, and a failure or inability by such parties to provide these products or services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.
we depend heavily on suppliers, their subcontractors, and other third parties in order for us to efficiently operate our business. due to the complexity of our business, it is not unusual for multiple vendors located in multiple locations to help us to develop, maintain, and troubleshoot products and services, such as network components, software development services, and billing and customer service support. our suppliers may provide services outside of the united states, which carries associated additional regulatory and legal obligations. we commonly rely upon the suppliers to provide contractual assurances and accurate information regarding risks associated with their provision of products or services in accordance with our expectations and standards such as our supplier code of conduct and our third party-risk management standards. failure of such suppliers to comply with our expectations and standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
there are multiple sources for the types of products and services we purchase or use. however, there are a limited number of suppliers for billing services, voice and data communications transport services, network infrastructure, equipment, handsets, other devices, and payment processing services, among other products and services. disruptions or failure of such suppliers to adequately perform could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
in the past, our suppliers, contractors, service providers and third-party retailers may not have always performed at the levels we expected or at the levels required by their contracts. our business could be severely disrupted if key suppliers, contractors, service providers, or third-party retailers fail to comply with their contracts or become unable to continue provision of services or supplies. our business could also be disrupted if we experience delays or service degradation during any transition to a new outsourcing provider or other supplier or if we are required to replace the supplied products or services with those from another source, especially if the replacement becomes necessary on short notice. any such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
economic, political, and market conditions may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results, as well as our access to financing on favorable terms or at all.
our business, financial condition, and operating results are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including interest rates, consumer credit conditions, consumer debt levels, consumer confidence, rates of inflation (or concerns about deflation), unemployment rates, economic growth, energy costs, and other macro-economic factors. difficult, or worsening, general economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
market volatility, political and economic uncertainty, and weak economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results in a number of ways. our services are available to a broad customer base, a significant segment of which may be more vulnerable to weak economic conditions. we may have greater difficulty in gaining new customers within this segment, and existing customers may be more likely to terminate service due to an inability to pay.
weak economic conditions and credit conditions may also adversely impact our suppliers and dealers, some of which have filed for or may be considering bankruptcy, or may experience cash flow or liquidity problems, or are unable to obtain or refinance
12
credit such that they may no longer be able to operate. any of these could adversely impact our ability to distribute, market, or sell our products and services.
in addition, instability in the global financial markets could lead to periodic volatility in the credit, equity, and fixed income markets. this volatility could limit our access to the credit markets, leading to higher borrowing costs or, in some cases, the inability to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.
the agreements governing our indebtedness and other financing arrangements include restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility.
the agreements governing our indebtedness and other financing arrangements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. these restrictions, subject in certain cases to customary baskets, exceptions, and incurrence-based ratio tests, may limit our or our subsidiaries' ability to engage in some transactions, including the following:
•   incurring additional indebtedness and issuing preferred stock;
•   paying dividends, redeeming capital stock, or making other restricted payments or investments;
•   selling or buying assets, properties, or licenses, including participating in future fcc auctions of spectrum or private sales of spectrum;
•   developing assets, properties, or licenses that we have or in the future may procure;
•   creating liens on assets;
•   engaging in mergers, acquisitions, business combinations, or other transactions;
•   entering into transactions with affiliates; and
•   placing restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments.
these restrictions could limit our ability to react to changes in our operating environment or the economy. any future indebtedness that we incur may contain similar or more restrictive covenants. any failure to comply with the restrictions of our debt agreements and other financing arrangements may result in an event of default under these agreements, which in turn may result in defaults or acceleration of obligations under these agreements and other agreements, giving our lenders the right to terminate any commitments they had made to provide us with further funds and to require us to repay all amounts then outstanding. any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
our significant indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
our ability to make payments on our debt, to repay our existing indebtedness when due, and to fund our capital-intensive business and operations, and significant planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is in turn subject to the operational risks described elsewhere in this report. our debt service obligations could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and operating results, including by:
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the communications industry or pursuing growth opportunities;
•   reducing the amount of cash available for other operational or strategic needs; and
•   placing us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors who are less leveraged than we are.
some of our debt also has a floating rate of interest linked to various indices. if the change in indices result in interest rate increases, debt service requirements will increase, which could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results. in addition, any agreements we have and may continue to enter into to limit our exposure to interest rate increases may not offer complete protection from this risk, and any portion not subject to such agreements would have full exposure to interest rate increases. any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act could result in a loss of investor confidence regarding our financial statements or may have a material adverse effect on our business.
under section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, we along with our independently registered public accounting firm are required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. we rely heavily on it systems as an important part of our internal controls in order to operate, transact, and otherwise manage our business, as well as provide
13
effective and timely reporting of our financial results. failure to design and maintain effective internal controls, including those over our it systems, could constitute a material weakness that could result in inaccurate financial statements, inaccurate disclosures, or failure to prevent fraud. if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, investor confidence regarding our financial statements and our business could be materially adversely affected.
our financial condition and operating results will be impaired if we experience high fraud rates related to device financing, credit cards, dealers, or subscriptions.
our operating costs could increase substantially as a result of fraud, including device financing, customer credit card, subscription, or dealer fraud. if our fraud detection strategies and processes are not successful in detecting and controlling fraud, whether directly or by way of the systems, processes, and operations of third parties such as national retailers, dealers, and others, the resulting loss of revenue or increased expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.
we rely on highly-skilled personnel throughout all levels of our business. our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel or maintain our corporate culture.
the market for highly-skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. we believe that our future success depends in substantial part on our ability to recruit, hire, motivate, develop, and retain talented and highly-skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. doing so may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions, changes to u.s. immigration policy, competitors' hiring practices, employee tolerance for the significant amount of change within and demands on our company and our industry, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to retain and motivate our existing employees and to attract new employees. if we do not succeed in retaining and motivating our existing key employees and attracting new key personnel, we may not be able to meet our business plan and, as a result, our revenue growth and profitability may be materially adversely affected.
any acquisition, investment, or merger may subject us to significant risks, any of which may harm our business.
we may pursue acquisitions of, investments in or mergers with businesses, technologies, services and/or products that complement or expand our business. some of these potential transactions could be significant relative to the size of our business and operations. any such transaction would involve a number of risks and could present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:
•   diversion of management attention from running our existing business;
•   increased costs to integrate the networks, spectrum, technology, personnel, customer base and business practices of the business involved in any such transaction with our business;
•   difficulties in effectively integrating the financial and operational reporting systems of the business involved in any such transaction into (or supplanting such systems with) our financial and operational reporting infrastructure and internal control framework in an effective and timely manner;
•   potential exposure to material liabilities not discovered in the due diligence process or as a result of any litigation arising in connection with any such transaction;
•   significant transaction expenses in connection with any such transaction, whether consummated or not;
•   risks related to our ability to obtain any required regulatory approvals necessary to consummate any such transaction;
•   acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and any such financing could significantly increase our outstanding indebtedness or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings; and
•   any business, technology, service, or product involved in any such transaction may significantly under-perform relative to our expectations, and we may not achieve the benefits we expect from our transaction, which could, among other things, also result in a write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with such transaction.
for any or all of these reasons, our pursuit of an acquisition, investment, or merger may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
14
risks related to legal and regulatory matters changes in regulations or in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
the fcc regulates the licensing, construction, modification, operation, ownership, sale, and interconnection of wireless communications systems, as do some state and local regulatory agencies. in particular, the fcc imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees, the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered, and the resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands. additionally, the ftc and other federal and state agencies have asserted that they have jurisdiction over some consumer protection, and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of wireless products and services. we are subject to regulatory oversight by various federal, state and local agencies, as well as judicial review and actions, on issues related to the wireless industry that include, but are not limited to: roaming, interconnection, spectrum allocation and licensing, facilities siting, pole attachments, intercarrier compensation, universal service fund ("usf"), net neutrality, 911 services, consumer protection, consumer privacy, and cybersecurity. we are also subject to regulations in connection with other aspects of our business, including handset financing and insurance activities.
we cannot assure you that the fcc or any other federal, state or local agencies will not adopt regulations or take enforcement or other actions that would adversely affect our business, impose new costs, or require changes in current or planned operations. for example, under the obama administration, the fcc established new net neutrality and privacy regimes that applied to our operations. both sets of rules potentially subjected some of our initiatives and practices to more burdensome requirements and heightened scrutiny by federal and state regulators, the public, edge providers, and private litigants regarding whether such initiatives or practices are compliant. while the fcc rules are now largely rolled back under the trump administration, some state legislators and regulators are seeking to replace them with state laws, perpetuating uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment around these issues.
in addition, states are increasingly focused on the quality of service and support that wireless communication providers provide to their customers and several states have proposed or enacted new and potentially burdensome regulations in this area. we also face potential investigations by, and inquiries from or actions by state public utility commissions. we also cannot assure you that congress will not amend the communications act, from which the fcc obtains its authority and which serves to limit state authority, or enact other legislation in a manner that could be adverse to our business.
failure to comply with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. we could be subject to fines, forfeitures, and other penalties (including, in extreme cases, revocation of our spectrum licenses) for failure to comply with fcc or other governmental regulations, even if any such non-compliance was unintentional. the loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.
unfavorable outcomes of legal proceedings may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
we are regularly involved in a number of legal proceedings before various state and federal courts, the fcc, the ftc, other federal agencies, and state and local regulatory agencies, including state attorneys general. such legal proceedings can be complex, costly, and highly disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and other key personnel. the assessment of the outcome of legal proceedings, including our potential liability, if any, is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events that are not within our control. the amounts ultimately received or paid upon settlement or pursuant to final judgment, order or decree may differ materially from amounts accrued in our financial statements. in addition, litigation or similar proceedings could impose restraints on our current or future manner of doing business. such potential outcomes including judgments, awards, settlements or orders could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
we offer highly regulated financial services products. these products expose us to a wide variety of state and federal regulations.
the financing of devices, through our eip and jump! on demand programs, has expanded our regulatory compliance obligations. failure to remain compliant with applicable regulations, may increase our risk exposure in the following areas:
•   consumer complaints and potential examinations or enforcement actions by federal and state regulatory agencies, including but not limited to the consumer financial protection board, state attorneys general, the fcc and the ftc; and
15
•   regulatory fines, penalties, enforcement actions, civil litigation, and/or class action lawsuits.
failure to comply with applicable regulations and the realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
we may not be able to adequately protect the intellectual property rights on which our business depends or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties.
we rely on a combination of patent, service mark, trademark, and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which offer only limited protection. the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary rights. we may not have the ability in certain jurisdictions to adequately protect intellectual property rights. moreover, others may independently develop processes and technologies that are competitive to ours. also, we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights may increase the cost of protecting these rights or reduce our revenues. we cannot be sure that any legal actions against such infringers will be successful, even when our rights have been infringed. we cannot assure you that our pending or future patent applications will be granted or enforceable, or that the rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide us with any competitive advantages. in addition, we cannot assure you that any trademark or service mark registrations will be issued with respect to pending or future applications or will provide adequate protection of our brands. we do not have insurance coverage for intellectual property losses, and as such, a charge for an anticipated settlement or an adverse ruling awarding damages represents an unplanned loss event. any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. we are a defendant in numerous intellectual property lawsuits, including patent infringement lawsuits, which exposes us to the risk of adverse financial impact either by way of significant settlement amounts or damage awards. as we adopt new technologies and new business systems, and provide customers with new products and/or services, we may face additional infringement claims. these claims could require us to cease certain activities or to cease selling relevant products and services. these claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend, and divert management resources, and expose us to significant damages awards or settlements, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. in addition to litigation directly involving our company, our vendors and suppliers can be threatened with patent litigation and/or subjected to the threat of disruption or blockage of sale, use, or importation of products, posing the risk of supply chain interruption to particular products and associated services which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
our business may be impacted by new or changing tax laws or regulations and actions by federal, state, and/or local agencies, or how judicial authorities apply tax laws.
in connection with the products and services we sell, we calculate, collect, and remit various federal, state, and local taxes, surcharges and regulatory fees ("tax" or "taxes") to numerous federal, state and local governmental authorities, including federal usf contributions and common carrier regulatory fees. in addition, we incur and pay state and local taxes and fees on purchases of goods and services used in our business.
tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. in many cases, the application of tax laws (including the recently enacted tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 in the united states) is uncertain and subject to differing interpretations, especially when evaluated against new technologies and telecommunications services, such as broadband internet access and cloud related services. changes in tax laws could also impact revenue on tax inclusive plans.
in the event that we have incorrectly described, disclosed, calculated, assessed, or remitted amounts that were due to governmental authorities, we could be subject to additional taxes, fines, penalties, or other adverse actions, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and operating results. in the event that federal, state, and/or local municipalities were to significantly increase taxes on our network, operations, or services, or seek to impose new taxes, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
our wireless licenses are subject to renewal and may be revoked in the event that we violate applicable laws.
our existing wireless licenses are subject to renewal upon the expiration of the 10-year or 15-year period for which they are granted. historically, the fcc has approved our license renewal applications. however, the communications act provides that licenses may be revoked for cause and license renewal applications denied if the fcc determines that a renewal would not serve the public interest. in addition, our licenses are subject to our compliance with the terms set forth in the agreement
16
pertaining to national security among deutsche telekom, the federal bureau of investigation, the department of justice, the department of homeland security and the company. the failure of deutsche telekom or the company to comply with the terms of this agreement could result in fines, injunctions and other penalties, including potential revocation or non-renewal of our spectrum licenses. if we fail to timely file to renew any wireless license or fail to meet any regulatory requirements for renewal, including construction and substantial service requirements, we could be denied a license renewal. many of our wireless licenses are subject to interim or final construction requirements and there is no guarantee that the fcc will find our construction, or the construction of prior licensees, sufficient to meet the build-out or renewal requirements. the fcc has pending a rulemaking proceeding to reevaluate, among other things, its wireless license renewal showings and standards and may in this or other proceedings promulgate changes or additional substantial requirements or conditions to its renewal rules, including revising license build-out requirements. accordingly, we cannot assure you that the fcc will renew our wireless licenses upon their expiration. if any of our wireless licenses were to be revoked or not renewed upon expiration, we would not be permitted to provide services under that license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
our business could be adversely affected by findings of product liability for health/safety risks from wireless devices and transmission equipment, as well as by changes to regulations/radio frequency emission standards.
we do not manufacture the devices or other equipment that we sell, and we depend on our suppliers to provide defect-free and safe equipment. suppliers are required by applicable law to manufacture their devices to meet certain governmentally imposed safety criteria. however, even if the devices we sell meet the regulatory safety criteria, we could be held liable with the equipment manufacturers and suppliers for any harm caused by products we sell if such products are later found to have design or manufacturing defects. we generally seek to enter into indemnification agreements with the manufacturers who supply us with devices to protect us from losses associated with product liability, but we cannot guarantee that we will be fully protected against all losses associated with a product that is found to be defective.
allegations have been made that the use of wireless handsets and wireless transmission equipment, such as cell towers, may be linked to various health concerns, including cancer and brain tumors. lawsuits have been filed against manufacturers and carriers in the industry claiming damages for alleged health problems arising from the use of wireless handsets. in addition, the fcc has from time to time gathered data regarding wireless handset emissions and its assessment of this issue may evolve based on its findings. the media has also reported incidents of handset battery malfunction, including reports of batteries that have overheated. these allegations may lead to changes in regulatory standards. there have also been other allegations regarding wireless technology, including allegations that wireless handset emissions may interfere with various electronic medical devices (including hearing aids and pacemakers), airbags and anti-lock brakes. defects in the products of our suppliers, such as the 2016 recall by a handset original equipment manufacturer ("oem") on one of its smartphone devices, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
additionally, there are safety risks associated with the use of wireless devices while operating vehicles or equipment. concerns over any of these risks and the effect of any legislation, rules or regulations that have been and may be adopted in response to these risks could limit our ability to sell our wireless services.
risks related to ownership of our common stock we are controlled by deutsche telekom, whose interests may differ from the interests of our other stockholders.
deutsche telekom beneficially owns and possesses majority voting power of the fully diluted shares of our common stock.
through its control of the voting power of our common stock and the rights granted to deutsche telekom in our certificate of incorporation and the stockholder's agreement, deutsche telekom controls the election of our directors and all other matters requiring the approval of our stockholders. by virtue of deutsche telekom's voting control, we are a "controlled company," as defined in the nasdaq listing rules, and are not subject to nasdaq requirements that would otherwise require us to have a majority of independent directors, a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors. accordingly, our stockholders will not be afforded the same protections generally as stockholders of other nasdaq-listed companies with respect to corporate governance for so long as we rely on these exemptions from the corporate governance requirements.
17
in addition, our certificate of incorporation and the stockholder's agreement restrict us from taking certain actions without deutsche telekom's prior written consent as long as deutsche telekom beneficially owns 30% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock, including:
•   the incurrence of debt (excluding certain permitted debt) if our consolidated ratio of debt to cash flow, as defined in the indenture dated april 28, 2013, for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which financial statements are available would exceed 5.25 to 1.0 on a pro forma basis;
•   the acquisition of any business, debt or equity interests, operations or assets of any person for consideration in excess of $1.0 billion;
•   the sale of any of our or our subsidiaries' divisions, businesses, operations or equity interests for consideration in excess of $1.0 billion;
•   the incurrence of secured debt (excluding certain permitted secured debt);
•   any change in the size of our board of directors;
•   the issuances of equity securities in excess of 10% of our outstanding shares or to repurchase debt held by deutsche telekom;
•   the repurchase or redemption of equity securities or the declaration of extraordinary or in-kind dividends or distributions other than on a pro rata basis; or
•   the termination or hiring of our chief executive officer.
these restrictions could prevent us from taking actions that our board of directors may otherwise determine are in the best interests of the company and our stockholders or that may be in the best interests of our other stockholders.
deutsche telekom effectively has control over all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election or removal of directors, changes to our certificate of incorporation, a sale or merger of our company and other transactions requiring stockholder approval under delaware law. deutsche telekom's controlling interest may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discouraging a third party from seeking to acquire, the company. deutsche telekom may have strategic, financial, or other interests different from our other stockholders, including as the holder of a substantial amount of our indebtedness and as the counter-party in a number of commercial arrangements, and may make decisions adverse to the interests of our other stockholders.
in addition, we license certain trademarks from deutsche telekom, including the right to use the trademark "t-mobile" as a name for the company and our flagship brand, under a trademark license agreement between deutsche telekom and the company.  as described in more detail in our proxy statement under the heading "transactions with related persons and approval", we are obligated under the trademark license to pay deutsche telekom a royalty in an amount equal to 0.25%, which we refer to as the royalty rate, of the net revenue (as defined in the trademark license) generated by products and services sold by the company under the licensed trademarks. however, the license agreement includes a royalty rate adjustment mechanism that will occur in early 2018 and potentially result in a new royalty rate effective in january 2019.  we also have the right to terminate the trademark license upon one year's prior notice. an increase in the royalty rate or termination of the trademark license could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
future sales or issuances of our common stock, including sales by deutsche telekom, could have a negative impact on our stock price.
we cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares or the availability of shares of our common stock will have on the prevailing trading price of our common stock from time to time. sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline and could result in dilution of your shares.
we and deutsche telekom are parties to the stockholder's agreement pursuant to which deutsche telekom is free to transfer its shares in public sales without notice, as long as such transactions would not result in the transferee owning 30% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock. if a transfer would exceed the 30% threshold, it is prohibited unless the transferee makes a binding offer to purchase all of the other outstanding shares on the same price and terms. the stockholder's agreement does not otherwise impose any other restrictions on the sales of common stock by deutsche telekom. moreover, we have filed a shelf registration statement with respect to the common stock and certain debt securities held by deutsche telekom, which would facilitate the resale by deutsche telekom of all or any portion of the shares of our common stock it holds. the sale of shares of our common stock by deutsche telekom (other than in transactions involving the purchase of all of our outstanding shares) could significantly increase the number of shares available in the market, which could cause a decrease
18
in our stock price. in addition, even if deutsche telekom does not sell a large number of its shares into the market, its right to transfer a large number of shares into the market may depress our stock price.
our stock price may be volatile, and may fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our business, financial condition and operating results.
the trading prices of the securities of communications companies historically have been highly volatile, and the trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations. our stock price may fluctuate in reaction to a number of events and factors that may include, among other things:
•   our or our competitors' actual or anticipated operating and financial results; introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors or changes in service plans or pricing by us or our competitors;
•   analyst projections, predictions and forecasts, analyst target prices for our securities and changes in, or our failure to meet, securities analysts' expectations;
•   transaction in our common stock by major investors;
•   share repurchases by us or purchases by deutsche telekom;
•   deutsche telekom's financial performance, results of operation, or actions implied or taken by deutsche telekom;
•   entry of new competitors into our markets or perceptions of increased price competition, including a price war;
•   our performance, including subscriber growth, and our financial and operational metric performance;
•   market perceptions relating to our services, network, handsets, and deployment of our lte platform and our access to iconic handsets, services, applications, or content;
•   market perceptions of the wireless communications industry and valuation models for us and the industry;
•   conditions or trends in the internet and the industry sectors we operate in;
•   changes in our credit rating or future prospects;
•   changes in interest rates;
•   changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;
•   the availability or perceived availability of additional capital in general and our access to such capital;
•   actual or anticipated consolidation, or other strategic mergers or acquisition activities involving us or our competitors, or other participants in related or adjacent industries, or market speculations regarding such activities;
•   disruptions of our operations or service providers or other vendors necessary to our network operations;
•   the general state of the u.s. and world politics and economies; and
•   availability of additional spectrum, whether by the announcement, commencement, bidding and closing of auctions for new spectrum or the acquisition of companies that own spectrum, and the extent to which we or our competitors succeed in acquiring additional spectrum.
in addition, the stock market has been volatile in the recent past and has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, which may continue for the foreseeable future. this volatility has had a significant impact on the trading price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in the communications industry. these changes frequently occur irrespective of the operating performance of the affected companies. hence, the trading price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our business, financial condition and operating results.
we have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.
we have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. our credit facilities and the indentures and supplemental indentures governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock. we currently intend to use future earnings, if any, to invest in our business and to fund our existing stock repurchase program.
19
our previously announced stock repurchase program, and any subsequent stock purchase program put in place from time to time, could affect the price of our common stock, increase the volatility of our common stock and could diminish our cash reserves. such repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.
we may have in place from time to time, a stock repurchase program. any such stock repurchase program adopted will not obligate the company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. the timing and actual number of shares repurchased under any such stock repurchase program depends on a variety of factors including the timing of open trading windows, the price of our common stock, corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions. we may effect repurchases under any stock repurchase program from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, including accelerated stock repurchase arrangements. repurchases pursuant to any such stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. the existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. there can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock. although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program's effectiveness. additionally, our share repurchase program could diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions. see item 5. market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities and note 10 - repurchases of common stock included in part ii of this form 10-k for further information.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the objectives of our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") are to provide users of our consolidated financial statements with the following:
•   a narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results;
•   context to the financial statements; and
•   information that allows assessment of the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance.
our md&a is provided as a supplement to, and should be read together with, our audited consolidated financial statements for the three years ended december 31, 2017 included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k. except as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout our md&a are those of t-mobile us, inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
business overview change in accounting principle effective january 1, 2017, the imputed discount on eip receivables, which is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and was previously recognized within interest income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income, is recognized within other revenues in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. we believe this presentation is preferable because it provides a better representation of amounts earned from the company's major ongoing operations and aligns with industry practice thereby enhancing comparability. we have applied this change retrospectively and the effect of this change for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, was a reclassification of $248 million and $414 million, respectively, from interest income to other revenues. the amortization of imputed discount on our eip receivables for the year ended december 31, 2017 was $280 million. for additional information, see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
un-carrier strategy the un-carrier is about adding value to the customer relationship by changing the rules of the industry and giving our customers more. we introduced our un-carrier strategy in 2013 with the objective of eliminating customer pain points from the unnecessary complexity of the wireless communication industry. since that time, we have continued our efforts with the launch of additional initiatives of our un-carrier strategy. during 2017, we launched the following un-carrier initiatives:
•   in january 2017, we introduced, un-carrier next, where monthly wireless service fees and sales taxes are included in the advertised monthly recurring charge for t-mobile one. we also unveiled kickback on t-mobile one, where participating customers who use 2 gb or less of data in a month, will get up to a $10 credit per qualifying line on their next month's bill. in addition, we introduced the un-contract for t-mobile one with the first-ever price guarantee on an unlimited 4g lte plan which allows current t-mobile one customers to keep their price for service until they decide to change it.
•   in september 2017, we introduced, un-carrier next: netflix on us, through an exclusive new partnership with netflix where qualifying t-mobile one customers on family plans can opt in for a standard monthly netflix service plan at no additional cost.
our ability to acquire and retain branded customers is important to our business in the generation of revenues and we believe our un-carrier strategy, along with ongoing network improvements, has been successful in attracting and retaining customers as evidenced by continued branded customer growth and improved branded postpaid phone and branded prepaid customer churn.

we believe current and future regulatory changes have made the lifeline program offered by our wholesale partners uneconomical. we will continue to support our wholesale partners offering the lifeline program, but have excluded the lifeline customers from our reported wholesale subscriber base resulting in the removal of 4,528,000 reported wholesale customers in 2017.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, a handset oem announced recalls on certain of its smartphone devices. as a result, in 2016 we recorded no revenue associated with the device sales to customers and impaired the devices to their net realizable value. the oem agreed to reimburse t-mobile for direct and indirect costs associated with the recall, as such, we recorded an amount due from the oem as an offset to the loss recorded in cost of equipment sales and the costs incurred within selling, general and administrative in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income and a reduction to accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. the reimbursement was received from the oem in 2017.

hurricane impacts during the third and fourth quarters of 2017, our operations in texas, florida and puerto rico experienced losses related to hurricanes. the impact to operating income for the year ended december 31, 2017, from lost revenue, assets damaged or destroyed and other hurricane related costs are included in the table below. we expect additional expenses to be incurred and customer activity to be impacted in the first quarter of 2018, primarily related to our operations in puerto rico. we have recognized insurance recoveries related to those hurricane losses in the amount of approximately $93 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 as an offset to the costs incurred within cost of services in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income and as an increase to other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. we continue to assess the damage of the hurricanes and work with our insurance carriers to submit claims for property damage and business interruption. we expect to record additional insurance recoveries related to these hurricanes in future periods.

results of operations highlights for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016
•   total revenues of $40.6 billion increased $3.1 billion, or 8%. the increase was primarily driven by growth in service and equipment revenues as further discussed below. on september 1, 2016, we sold our marketing and distribution rights to certain existing t-mobile co-branded customers to a current mvno partner for nominal consideration. the mvno transaction shifted branded postpaid revenues to wholesale revenues, but did not materially impact total revenues.
•   service revenues of $30.2 billion increased $2.3 billion, or 8%. the increase was primarily due to growth in our average branded customer base as a result of strong customer response to our un-carrier initiatives, promotions and the success of our metropcs brand.
•   equipment revenues of $9.4 billion increased $648 million, or 7%. the increase was primarily due to higher average revenue per device sold and an increase from customer purchases of leased devices at the end of the lease term, partially offset by lower lease revenues.
•   operating income of $4.9 billion increased $838 million, or 21%. the increase was primarily due to higher total service revenues and lower depreciation and amortization, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative, lower gains on disposal of spectrum licenses and higher cost of services expenses.
•   net income of $4.5 billion increased $3.1 billion, or 211%. the increase was primarily due to the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the "tcja"), which resulted in a net tax benefit of $2.2 billion in 2017, and higher operating income driven by the factors described above, partially offset by the negative impact from hurricanes. net income included net, after-tax spectrum gains of $174 million and $509 million, for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
•   adjusted ebitda, a non-gaap financial measure, of $11.2 billion increased $574 million, or 5%. the increase was primarily due to higher operating income driven by the factors described above, partially offset by lower gains on disposal of spectrum licenses. adjusted ebitda included pre-tax spectrum gains of $235 million and $835 million for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
•   net cash provided by operating activities of $8.0 billion increased $1.8 billion, or 30%. see "liquidity and capital resources" section for additional information.
•   free cash flow, a non-gaap financial measure, of $2.7 billion increased $1.3 billion, or 90%. see "liquidity and capital resources" section for additional information.

the following discussion and analysis is for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016 unless otherwise stated.
total revenues increased $3.1 billion, or 8%, primarily due to higher revenues from branded postpaid and prepaid customers as well as higher equipment revenues as discussed below.
branded postpaid revenues increased $1.3 billion, or 7%, primarily from:
•   a 7% increase in average branded postpaid phone customers, primarily from growth in our customer base driven by the continued strong customer response to our un-carrier initiatives and promotions for services and devices, including the growing success of our business channel, t-mobile for business; and
•   the positive impact from a decrease in the non-cash net revenue deferral for data stash; partially offset by
•   a 1% decrease in branded postpaid phone arpu primarily driven by dilution from promotions targeting families and new segments;
•   the mvno transaction; and
•   the negative impact from hurricanes of approximately $37 million.
branded prepaid revenues increased $827 million, or 10%, primarily from:
•   a 7% increase in average branded prepaid customers primarily driven by growth in the customer base; and
•   a 2% increase in branded prepaid arpu from the success of our metropcs brand and the optimization of our third-party distribution channels; partially offset by
•   the negative impact from hurricanes of approximately $11 million.
wholesale revenues increased $199 million, or 22%, primarily from the impact of the mvno transaction, growth in mvno customers and higher minimum commitment revenues.
roaming and other service revenues decreased $20 million, or 8%.
equipment revenues increased $648 million, or 7%, primarily from:
•   an increase of $445 million in device sales revenues excluding purchased lease devices, primarily due to:
•   higher average revenue per device sold due to an increase in the high-end device mix and the impacts of an oem recall of its smartphone devices in 2016, partially offset by an increase in promotions and device-related commissions spending; partially offset by
•   a 2% decrease in the number of devices sold, excluding purchased lease devices, driven by a lower branded postpaid handset upgrade rate. device sales revenue is recognized at the time of sale;
•   an increase of $395 million from customers' purchase of leased devices at the end of the lease term;
•   an increase of $231 million primarily related to proceeds from liquidation of returned customer handsets in 2017; and
•   an increase of $130 million in sim and upgrade revenue; partially offset by
•   a decrease of $539 million in lease revenues from declining jump! on demand population due to shifting focus to our eip financing option beginning in the first quarter of 2016;
•   a decrease of $18 million in accessory revenue primarily related to the decrease in device sales volume; and
•   the negative impact from hurricanes of approximately $8 million.
under our jump! on demand program, upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return or purchase their device. revenue for purchased leased devices is recorded as equipment revenues when revenue recognition criteria have been met.
gross eip device financing to our customers increased by $437 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, primarily due to growth in the gross amount of equipment financed on eip. the increase was also due to certain customers on leased devices reaching the end of lease term who financed their devices over a nine-month eip.
other revenues increased $150 million, or 16%, primarily due to higher revenue from revenue share agreements with third parties.

our operating expenses consist of the following categories:
•   cost of services primarily includes costs directly attributable to providing wireless service through the operation of our network, including direct switch and cell site costs, such as rent, network access and transport costs, utilities, maintenance, associated labor costs, long distance costs, regulatory program costs, roaming fees paid to other carriers and data content costs.
•   cost of equipment sales primarily includes costs of devices and accessories sold to customers and dealers, device costs to fulfill insurance and warranty claims, costs related to returned and purchased leased devices, write-downs of inventory related to shrinkage and obsolescence, and shipping and handling costs.
•   selling, general and administrative primarily includes costs not directly attributable to providing wireless service for the operation of sales, customer care and corporate activities. these include commissions paid to dealers and retail employees for activations and upgrades, labor and facilities costs associated with retail sales force and administrative space, marketing and promotional costs, customer support and billing, bad debt expense, losses from sales of receivables and back office administrative support activities.
operating expenses increased $2.3 billion, or 7%, primarily from higher cost of services, cost of equipment sales, selling, general and administrative and lower gains on disposal of spectrum licenses, partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization as discussed below.
cost of services increased $369 million, or 6%, primarily from:
•   higher lease, engineering and employee-related expenses associated with network expansion; and
•   the negative impact from hurricanes of $105 million, net of insurance recoveries; partially offset by
•   lower long distance and toll costs as we continue to renegotiate contracts with vendors; and
•   lower regulatory expenses.
cost of equipment sales increased $789 million, or 7%, primarily from:
•   an increase of $806 million in device cost of equipment sales, excluding purchased leased devices, primarily due to:
•   a higher average cost per device sold primarily from an increase in the high-end device mix and from the impact of an oem recall of its smartphone devices in 2016; partially offset by
•   a 2% decrease in the number of devices sold, excluding purchased lease devices, driven by a lower branded postpaid handset upgrade rate.
•   an increase of $201 million in lease device cost of equipment sales, primarily due to:
•   an increase in lease buyouts as leases began reaching their term dates in 2017; partially offset by
•   a decrease in write downs to market value of devices returned to inventory resulting from a decrease in the number of leased device upgrades.
•   these increases are partially offset by a decrease of $159 million primarily related to:
•   a decrease in insurance and warranty claims;
•   higher proceeds from liquidation of returned customer handsets under our insurance programs; and
•   lower inventory adjustments related to physical adjustments and obsolete inventory; partially offset by
•   higher costs from an increase in the volume of liquidated returned customer handsets outside of our insurance programs.
•   a decrease of $57 million in accessory cost primarily driven by the decrease in device sales volume.
under our jump! on demand program, upon device upgrade or at the end of the lease term, customers must return or purchase their device. the cost of purchased leased devices is recorded as cost of equipment sales. returned devices transferred from property and equipment, net are recorded as inventory and are valued at the lower of cost or market with any write-down to market recognized as cost of equipment sales.

selling, general and administrative increased $881 million, or 8%, primarily from higher commissions, employee-related costs, promotional and advertising costs, and costs related to outsourced functions and managed services to support our growing customer base, partially offset by lower handset repair services cost. additionally, the negative impact from hurricanes of approximately $36 million contributed to the increase.
depreciation and amortization decreased $259 million, or 4%, primarily from:
•   lower depreciation expense related to our jump! on demand program resulting from a lower number of devices under lease. under our jump! on demand program, the cost of a leased wireless device is depreciated to its estimated residual value over the period expected to provide utility to us; partially offset by
•   the continued build-out of our 4g lte network;
•   the implementation of the first component of our new billing system; and
•   growth in our distribution footprint.
cost of metropcs business combination decreased $104 million. on july 1, 2015, we officially completed the shutdown of the metropcs cdma network. network decommissioning costs primarily relate to the acceleration of lease costs for cell sites that would have otherwise been recognized as cost of services over the remaining lease term had we not decommissioned the cell sites. we do not expect to incur significant additional network decommissioning costs in 2018.
gains on disposal of spectrum licenses decreased $600 million, or 72%, primarily from gains of $636 million and $191 million on disposal of spectrum licenses with at&t and sprint during the first quarter and third quarter of 2016, respectively. these 2016 gains were partially offset by gains of $235 million from spectrum license transactions with at&t and verizon in 2017.
net income increased $3.1 billion, primarily due to the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 ("tcja") as discussed below, higher operating income and a net decrease in interest expense, partially offset by the negative impact from hurricanes of approximately $130 million, net of insurance recoveries.
•   operating income, the components of which are discussed above, increased $838 million, or 21%. the negative impact from the hurricanes for the year ended december 31, 2017 was approximately $201 million, net of insurance recoveries.
•   income tax benefit (expense) changed $2.2 billion, from an expense of $867 million in 2016 to a benefit of $1.4 billion in 2017 primarily from:
•   a lower effective tax rate. the effective tax rate was a benefit of 43.5% in 2017, compared to an expense of 37.3% in 2016. the decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the impact of the tcja, which resulted in a net tax benefit of $2.2 billion in 2017, substantially due to a re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities; and
•   a $319 million reduction in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in certain state jurisdictions in 2017; partially offset by
•   higher income before income taxes.
the tcja was enacted december 22, 2017 and is generally effective beginning january 1, 2018. the tcja includes numerous changes to existing tax law, which have been reflected in the 2017 consolidated financial statements. the state corporate income tax impact of the tcja is complex and will continue to evolve as jurisdictions evaluate conformity to the numerous federal tax law changes. as such, a re-measurement of state deferred tax assets and liabilities and the associated net tax benefit or expense may result within the next 12 months. the tcja resulted in a net tax benefit of $2.2 billion in 2017.

•   an increase from the issuance of the $1.0 billion of senior notes in april 2016.
•   interest expense to affiliates increased $248 million, or 79%, primarily from:
•   issuance of $4.0 billion secured term loan facility with deutsche telekom ag ("dt") entered into in january 2017;
•   issuance of a total of $4.0 billion in senior notes in may 2017;
•   an increase in drawings on our revolving credit facility; and
•   issuance of $500 million in senior notes in september 2017; partially offset by
•   a decrease from lower interest rates achieved through refinancing of a total of $2.5 billion of senior reset notes in april 2017.

the change to the results of operations of our non-guarantor subsidiaries was primarily from:
•   higher service revenues primarily due to the result of an increase in activity of the non-guarantor subsidiary that provides device insurance, primarily driven by growth in our customer base;
•   lower cost of equipment sales expenses primarily due to a decrease in device insurance claims and a decrease in higher cost devices used, partially offset by a decrease in device non-return fees charged to customers; and
33
•   lower selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to a decrease in device insurance program service fees, partially offset by higher costs to support our growing customer base.

the following discussion and analysis is for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 unless otherwise stated.
certain prior year amounts relating to the change in accounting principle which presents the imputed discount on eip receivables, which is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method, and was previously presented within interest income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income, is now presented within other revenues in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
total revenues increased $5.0 billion, or 15%, primarily due to:
branded postpaid revenues increased $1.8 billion, or 11%, primarily from:
•   a 13% increase in the number of average branded postpaid phone and mobile broadband customers, driven by strong customer response to our un-carrier initiatives and promotions for services and devices;
•   higher device insurance program revenues primarily from customer growth; and
•   higher regulatory program revenues; partially offset by
•   an increase in the non-cash net revenue deferral for data stash; and
•   the mvno transaction.
branded prepaid revenues increased $1.0 billion, or 13%, primarily from:
•   a 13% increase in the number of average branded prepaid customers driven by the success of our metropcs brand; and
•   continued growth in new markets.
wholesale revenues increased $211 million, or 30%, primarily from:
•   the mvno transaction;
•   growth in customers of certain mvno partners; and
•   an increase in data usage per customer.
roaming and other service revenues increased $57 million, or 30%, primarily due to higher international roaming revenues driven by an increase in inbound roaming volumes.
equipment revenues increased $2.0 billion, or 30%, primarily from:
•   an increase of $1.2 billion in lease revenues resulting from the launch of our jump! on demand program at the end of the second quarter of 2015. revenues associated with leased devices are recognized over the lease term; and
•   an increase of $570 million in device sales revenues, primarily due to a 9% increase in the number of devices sold. device sales revenue is recognized at the time of sale.
gross eip device financing to our customers increased by $923 million to $6.1 billion primarily due to an increase in devices financed due to our focus on eip sales in 2016, compared to focus on devices financed on jump! on demand after the launch of the program at the end of the second quarter of 2015.
34
other revenues decreased $9 million, or 1%, primarily due to:
•   an increase in sales of certain eip receivables pursuant to our eip receivables sales arrangement resulting from an increase in the maximum funding commitment in june 2016. interest associated with eip receivables is imputed at the time of a device sale and then recognized over the financed installment term. see note 2 - receivables and allowance for credit losses of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information; and
•   focus on devices financed on jump! on demand in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 following the launch of the program of at the end of the second quarter 2015; partially offset by
•   higher revenue from revenue share agreements with third parties; and

•   higher regulatory program costs and expenses associated with network expansion and the build-out of our network to utilize our 700 mhz a-block spectrum licenses, including higher employee-related costs; partially offset by
•   lower long distance and toll costs; and
•   synergies realized from the decommissioning of the metropcs cdma network.
cost of equipment sales increased $1.5 billion, or 16%, primarily from:
•   a 9% increase in the number of devices sold; and
•   an increase in the impact from returned and purchased leased devices.
under our jump! on demand program, the cost of the leased wireless device is capitalized and recognized as depreciation expense over the term of the lease rather than recognized as cost of equipment sales when the device is delivered to the customer. additionally, upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return or purchase their device. returned devices transferred from property and equipment, net are recorded as inventory and are valued at the lower of cost or market with any write-down to market recognized as cost of equipment sales.
selling, general and administrative increased $1.2 billion, or 12%, primarily from strategic investments to support our growing customer base including higher:
•   employee-related costs;
•   commissions driven by an increase in branded customer additions; and
•   promotional costs.
depreciation and amortization increased $1.6 billion, or 33%, primarily from:
•   $1.5 billion in depreciation expense related to devices leased under our jump! on demand program launched at the end of the second quarter of 2015. under our jump! on demand program, the cost of a leased wireless device is depreciated over the lease term to its estimated residual value. the total number of devices under lease was higher year-over-year, resulting in higher depreciation expense; and
•   the continued build-out of our 4g lte network.
cost of metropcs business combination decreased $272 million, or 72%, primarily from lower network decommissioning costs. in 2014, we began decommissioning the metropcs cdma network and certain other redundant network cell sites as part of the business combination. on july 1, 2015, we officially completed the shutdown of the metropcs cdma network. network decommissioning costs, which are excluded from adjusted ebitda, primarily relate to the acceleration of lease costs for cell sites that would have otherwise been recognized as cost of services over the remaining lease term had we not decommissioned the cell sites.
gains on disposal of spectrum licenses increased $672 million primarily from a $636 million gain from a spectrum license transaction with at&t recorded in the first quarter of 2016 and $199 million from other transactions in 2016, compared to
35
$163 million in 2015. see note 5 - goodwill, spectrum licenses and other intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
net income increased $727 million, or 99%, primarily from:
•   operating income, the components of which are discussed above, increased $1.6 billion, or 63%.
•   interest expense to affiliates decreased $99 million, or 24%, primarily from:
•   changes in the fair value of embedded derivative instruments associated with our senior reset notes issued to deutsch telekom in 2015; partially offset by

•   higher income before income taxes; and
•   a higher effective tax rate. the effective tax rate was 37.3% in 2016, compared to 25.1% in 2015. the increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to income tax benefits for discrete income tax items recognized in 2015 that did not impact 2016; partially offset by the recognition of $58 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments following the adoption of asu 2016-09 as of january 1, 2016.
•   interest expense increased $333 million, or 31%, primarily from:
•   higher average debt balances with third parties; and

(2)   we believe current and future regulatory changes have made the lifeline program offered by our wholesale partners uneconomical. we will continue to support our wholesale partners offering the lifeline program, but have excluded the lifeline customers from our reported wholesale subscriber base resulting in the removal of 4,528,000 reported wholesale customers in 2017.
(3)   the mvno transaction resulted in a transfer of branded postpaid phone customers and branded prepaid customers to wholesale customers on september 1, 2016. prospectively from september 1, 2016, net customer additions for these customers are included within wholesale customers.
branded customers total branded customers increased 4,475,000, or 8%, in 2017 primarily from:
•   higher branded postpaid phone customers driven by the continued strong customer response to our un-carrier initiatives and promotional activities, the growing success of our business channel, t-mobile for business, continued growth in existing markets and distribution expansion to new greenfield markets, and lower churn, partially offset by increased competitive activity in the marketplace with all competitors having launched unlimited rate plans in the first quarter of 2017;
•   higher branded prepaid customers driven by the continued success of our metro pcs brand and continued growth from distribution expansion, partially offset by the optimization of our third-party distribution channels; and
•   higher branded postpaid other customers primarily due to higher connected devices and digits.

•   higher branded postpaid customers driven by strong customer response to our un-carrier initiatives and promotional activities, partially offset by higher deactivations on a growing customer base.
wholesale wholesale customers decreased 3,345,000, or 19%, primarily due to lifeline subscribers, which were excluded from our reported wholesale subscriber base as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2017. this decrease was partially offset by the continued success of our m2m partnerships.
wholesale customers increased 3,259,000, or 23%, in 2016 primarily due the continued success of our m2m partnerships and the mvno transaction.

branded customers total branded net customer additions decreased 2,130,000, or 32%, in 2017 primarily from:
•   lower branded prepaid net customer additions primarily due to higher deactivations from a growing customer base, increased competitive activity in the marketplace and de-emphasis of the t-mobile prepaid brand. additional decreases resulted from the optimization of our third-party distribution channels; and

average revenue per user, average billings per user arpu represents the average monthly service revenue earned from customers. we believe arpu provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our service revenue realization per customer and assist in forecasting our future service revenues generated from our customer base. branded postpaid phone arpu excludes mobile broadband and digits customers and related revenues.
average billings per user ("abpu") represents the average monthly customer billings, including monthly lease revenues and eip billings before securitization, per customer. we believe branded postpaid abpu provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate average branded postpaid customer billings as it is indicative of estimated cash collections, including device financing payments, from our customers each month.

branded postpaid phone arpu branded postpaid phone arpu decreased $0.50, or 1%, in 2017 primarily from:
•   dilution from promotions targeting families and new segments; and
•   the negative impact from hurricanes of approximately $0.09; partially offset by
•   the mvno transaction as those customers had a lower arpu; and
•   a decrease in the non-cash net revenue deferral for data stash.
under existing revenue standards, t-mobile continues to expect that branded postpaid phone arpu in full-year 2018 will be generally stable compared to full-year 2017, with some quarterly variations.
we adopted asu 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606)" ("asu 2014-09"), as amended, on january 1, 2018. adoption of the standard will impact the timing, amount and allocation of our revenue and is expected to impact arpu. we will provide additional disclosures comparing results to previous gaap in our 2018 consolidated financial statements. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for information regarding recently issued accounting standards.
branded postpaid phone arpu decreased $0.21 in 2016 primarily from:
•   decreases due to an increase in the non-cash net revenue deferral for data stash; and
•   dilution from promotional activities; partially offset by
•   higher data attach rates;
•   the positive impact from our t-mobile one rate plans prior to the release of un-carrier next in 2017 which began including taxes and fees;
•   the transfer of customers as part of the mvno transaction as those customers had lower arpu;
•   continued growth of our insurance programs; and
•   higher regulatory program revenues.
branded postpaid abpu branded postpaid abpu decreased $2.26, or 4%, in 2017 primarily from:

•   growth in the branded postpaid other customer base with lower arpu; and
•   the negative impact from hurricanes of approximately $0.08.
branded postpaid abpu decreased $0.02 in 2016 primarily from:
•   lower eip billings due to the impact of our jump! on demand program launched at the end of the second quarter of 2015;
•   lower branded postpaid phone arpu, as described above; and
•   dilution from increased penetration of mobile broadband devices; partially offset by
•   an increase in lease revenues.
branded prepaid arpu branded prepaid arpu increased $0.77, or 2%, in 2017 primarily from:
•   continued growth of metropcs customers who generate higher arpu; and
•   the optimization of our third-party distribution channels; partially offset by
•   the negative impact from hurricanes of approximately $0.05.

adjusted ebitda is a non-gaap financial measure utilized by our management to monitor the financial performance of our operations. we use adjusted ebitda internally as a metric to evaluate and compensate our personnel and management for their performance, and as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors. management believes analysts and investors use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to evaluate overall operating performance and facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications companies because it is indicative of our ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding the impact of interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments, non-cash stock-based compensation, network decommissioning costs as they are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance and certain other nonrecurring income and expenses. adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations, net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap").
the following table illustrates the calculation of adjusted ebitda and reconciles adjusted ebitda to net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable gaap financial measure:

adjusted ebitda increased $574 million, or 5%, in 2017 primarily from:
•   an increase in branded postpaid and prepaid service revenues primarily due to strong customer response to our un-carrier initiatives, the ongoing success of our promotional activities, and the continued strength of our metropcs brand;
•   higher wholesale revenues; and
•   higher other revenues; partially offset by
•   higher selling, general and administrative expenses;
•   lower gains on disposal of spectrum licenses of $600 million; gains on disposal were $235 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to $835 million in the same period in 2016;
•   higher cost of services expense;
•   higher net losses on equipment; and
•   the negative impact from hurricanes of approximately $201 million, net of insurance recoveries.
adjusted ebitda increased $2.8 billion, or 36%, in 2016 primarily from:
•   increased branded postpaid and prepaid service revenues primarily due to strong customer response to our un-carrier initiatives and the ongoing success of our promotional activities;
•   higher gains on disposal of spectrum licenses of $672 million; gains on disposal were $835 million in 2016 compared to $163 million in 2015;
•   lower losses on equipment; and
•   focused cost control and synergies realized from the metropcs business combination, primarily in cost of services; partially offset by
•   higher selling, general and administrative.
effective january 1, 2017, the imputed discount on eip receivables, which was previously recognized within interest income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income, is recognized within other revenues in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. due to this presentation, the imputed discount on eip receivables is included in adjusted ebitda. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased $1.8 billion, or 30%, in 2017 primarily from:
•   $3.1 billion increase in net income;
•   $2.0 billion decrease in net non-cash adjustments to net income primarily due to changes in deferred income tax expense and depreciation and amortization, partially offset by gains on disposal of spectrum licenses; and
•   $757 million decrease in net cash outflows from changes in working capital primarily due to improvements in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, deferred purchase price from sales of receivables and accounts receivable, partially offset by changes in equipment installment plan receivables and other current and long-term assets and liabilities. the change in eip receivables was primarily due to a decrease in net cash proceeds from the sale of eip receivables as the year ended december 31, 2016 benefited from net cash proceeds of $361 million related to upsizing of the eip securitization facility.
cash provided by operating activities increased $721 million, or 13%, in 2016 primarily from:
•   $727 million increase in net income;
•   $1.4 billion increase in net non-cash income and expenses included in net income primarily due to changes in depreciation and amortization, deferred income tax expense and gains on disposal of spectrum licenses; partially offset by
•   $1.4 billion increase in net cash outflows from changes in working capital primarily due to changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $1.9 billion as well as the change in equipment installment plan receivables, including inflows from the sale of certain eip receivables, partially offset by the change in inventories. net cash used for accounts payable and accrued liabilities was $1.2 billion in 2016 as compared to net cash provided by accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $693 million in 2015. net cash proceeds from the sale of eip and service receivables was $536 million in 2016 as compared to $884 million in 2015.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased $5.4 billion, or 95%, in 2017 primarily from:
•   a $3.0 billion decrease in sales of short-term investments;
•   a $1.9 billion increase in purchases of spectrum licenses and other intangible assets, including deposits, primarily driven by our winning bid for 1,525 licenses in the 600 mhz spectrum auction during the second quarter of 2017; and
•   a $535 million increase in purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest primarily driven by growth in network build as we continued deployment of low band spectrum, including beginning deployment of 600 mhz.
cash used in investing activities decreased $3.9 billion, or 41%, in 2016, to a use of $5.7 billion primarily from:
•   $4.7 billion for purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest of $142 million primarily related to the build-out of our 4g lte network;
•   $4.0 billion for purchases of spectrum licenses and other intangible assets, including a $2.2 billion deposit made to a third party in connection with a potential asset purchase; partially offset by

free cash flow free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less payments for purchases of property and equipment. free cash flow is a non-gaap financial measure utilized by our management, investors and analysts of t-mobile's financial information to evaluate cash available to pay debt and provide further investment in the business.
the following table illustrates the calculation of free cash flow and reconciles free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, which we consider to be the most directly comparable gaap financial measure:

•   higher purchases of property and equipment primarily due to growth in network build as we deployed 700 mhz spectrum and began to deploy 600 mhz. cash purchases of property and equipment includes capitalized interest of $136 million and $142 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively.
free cash flow increased $743 million in 2016 primarily from:
•   higher net cash provided by operating activities, as described above; and
•   lower purchases of property and equipment from the build-out of our 4g lte network in 2016, as described above. cash purchases of property and equipment includes capitalized interest of $142 million and $246 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively.
we adopted asu 2016-15, "statement of cash flows (topic 230): classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments" on january 1, 2018. the standard will require a retrospective approach and impact the presentation of cash flows related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions, which is the deferred purchase price, resulting in a reclassification of cash

inflows from operating activities to investing activities of approximately $4.3 billion and $3.5 billion for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, in our consolidated statements of cash flows. the standard will also impact the presentation of cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, resulting in a reclassification of cash outflows from operating activities to financing activities of $188 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, in our consolidated financial statements. in the first quarter of 2018, we plan to redefine free cash flow to reflect the above changes in classification and present cash flows on a consistent basis for investor transparency. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for information regarding recently issued accounting standards.

on january 25, 2017, t-mobile usa, inc. ("t-mobile usa"), and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, entered into an agreement to borrow $4.0 billion under a secured term loan facility ("incremental term loan facility") with dt, our majority stockholder, to refinance $1.98 billion of outstanding senior secured term loans under its term loan credit agreement dated november 9, 2015, with the remaining net proceeds from the transaction used to redeem callable high yield debt. the incremental term loan facility increased dt's incremental term loan commitment provided to t-mobile usa under that certain first incremental facility amendment dated as of december 29, 2016, from $660 million to $2.0 billion and provided t-mobile usa with an additional $2.0 billion incremental term loan commitment.
on january 31, 2017, the loans under the incremental term loan facility were drawn in two tranches: (i) $2.0 billion of which bears interest at a rate equal to a per annum rate of libor plus a margin of 2.00% and matures on november 9, 2022, and (ii) $2.0 billion of which bears interest at a rate equal to a per annum rate of libor plus a margin of 2.25% and matures on january 31, 2024. in july 2017, we repriced the $2.0 billion incremental term loan facility maturing on january 31, 2024, with dt by reducing the interest rate to a per annum rate of libor plus a margin of 2.00%. no issuance fees were incurred related to this debt agreement for the year ended december 31, 2017.

the closing of the issuance and sale of the dt notes to dt, and exchange of the dt senior reset notes, is expected to occur on or about april 30, 2018.
financing arrangements we maintain a handset financing arrangement with deutsche bank ag ("deutsche bank"), which allows for up to $108 million in borrowings. under the handset financing arrangement, we can effectively extend payment terms for invoices payable to certain handset vendors. the interest rate on the handset financing arrangement is determined based on libor plus a specified margin per the arrangement. obligations under the handset financing arrangement are included in short-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. in 2016, we utilized and repaid $100 million under the financing arrangement. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, there was no outstanding balance.
we maintain vendor financing arrangements with our primary network equipment suppliers. under the respective agreements, we can obtain extended financing terms. the interest rate on the vendor financing arrangements is determined based on the difference between libor and a specified margin per the agreements. obligations under the vendor financing arrangements are included in short-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. in 2017, we utilized and repaid $300 million under the financing arrangement. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, there was no outstanding balance.
revolving credit facility we had an unsecured revolving credit facility with deutsche telekom which allowed for up to $500 million in borrowings. in december 2016, we terminated our $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility with deutsche telekom.

in january 2018, we utilized proceeds under the revolving credit facility to redeem $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% senior notes due 2022 and for general corporate purposes. as of february 5, 2018, there were no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility. the proceeds and borrowings from the revolving credit facility are presented in proceeds from borrowing on revolving credit facility and repayments of revolving credit facility within net cash (used in) provided by financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
see note 7 - debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
we could seek additional sources of liquidity, including through the issuance of additional long-term debt in 2018, to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses or other assets in private party transactions or for the refinancing of existing long-term debt on an opportunistic basis. excluding liquidity that could be needed for spectrum acquisitions or other assets, we expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for business operations for the next 12 months. our intended use of any such funds is for general corporate purposes, including for capital expenditures, spectrum purchases, opportunistic investments and acquisitions, redemption of high yield callable debt and stock purchases.
we determine future liquidity requirements, for both operations and capital expenditures, based in large part upon projected financial and operating performance, and opportunities to acquire additional spectrum. we regularly review and update these projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating results, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and other factors. there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial and operating results and capital requirements to differ materially from our projections, which could cause future liquidity to differ materially from our assessment.
the indentures and credit facilities governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding capital leases, contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the issuer and the guarantor subsidiaries (each as defined in note 16 - guarantor financial information of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form
49
10-k) to: incur more debt; pay dividends and make distributions on our common stock; make certain investments; repurchase stock; create liens or other encumbrances; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries; and merge, consolidate, or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. certain provisions of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties restrict the ability of the issuer to loan funds or make payments to the parent. however, the issuer is allowed to make certain permitted payments to the parent under the terms of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties. we were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants as of december 31, 2017.
capital lease facilities we have entered into uncommitted capital lease facilities with certain partners, which provide us with the ability to enter into capital leases for network equipment and services. as of december 31, 2017, we have committed to $2.1 billion of capital leases under these capital lease facilities, of which $887 million was executed during the year ended december 31, 2017.
capital expenditures our liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses and the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure. property and equipment capital expenditures primarily relate to our network transformation, including the build out of 700 mhz a-block and 600 mhz spectrum licenses. we expect cash purchases of property and equipment, excluding capitalized interest, to be in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion in 2018. this includes expenditures for 5g deployment. similar to 2017, cash capital expenditures will be front-end loaded in 2018 due to the build out of 600 mhz spectrum licenses. this does not include property and equipment obtained through capital lease agreements, leased wireless devices transferred from inventory or any additional purchases of spectrum licenses.
in april 2017, the fcc announced that we were the winning bidder of 1,525 licenses in the 600 mhz spectrum auction for an aggregate price of $8.0 billion. at the inception of the auction in june 2016, we deposited $2.2 billion with the fcc which, based on the outcome of the auction, was sufficient to cover our down payment obligation due in april 2017. in may 2017, we paid the fcc the remaining $5.8 billion of the purchase price using cash reserves and by issuing debt to dt, our majority stockholder, pursuant to existing debt purchase commitments. see note 7 - debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
the $5.8 billion payment of the purchase price is included in purchases of spectrum licenses and other intangible assets, including deposits within net cash used in investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. the licenses are included in spectrum licenses as of december 31, 2017, on our consolidated balance sheets. we began deployment of these licenses on our network in the third quarter of 2017. see note 5 - goodwill, spectrum licenses and other intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.

total contractual obligations                                          $8,067                 $10,712               $15,376                   $23,836                 $57,991
(1)   represents principal amounts of long-term debt to affiliates and third parties at maturity, excluding unamortized premium from purchase price allocation fair value adjustment, capital lease obligations and vendor financing arrangements. see note 7 - debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
(2)   future minimum payments, including principal and interest payments and imputed lease rental income, related to the tower obligations. see note 8 - tower obligations of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
(3)   future minimum lease payments for all cell site leases presented above to include payments due for the initial non-cancelable lease term only as they represent the payments which we cannot avoid at our option and also corresponds to our lease term assessment for new leases.
(4)   the minimum commitment for certain obligations is based on termination penalties that could be paid to exit the contracts. termination penalties are included in the above table as payments due as of the earliest we could exit the contract, typically in less than one year. for certain contracts that include fixed volume purchase commitments and fixed prices for various products, the purchase obligations are calculated using fixed volumes and contractually fixed prices for the products that are expected to be purchased. this table does not include open purchase orders as of december 31, 2017 under normal business purposes. see note 13 - commitments and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
(5)   represents future undiscounted cash flows related to decommissioned metropcs cdma network and certain other redundant cell sites as of december 31, 2017.
certain commitments and obligations are included in the table based on the year of required payment or an estimate of the year of payment. other long-term liabilities, excluding network decommissioning, have been omitted from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments, combined with the absence of historical trending to be used as a predictor of such payments. see note 14 - additional financial information of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
the purchase obligations reflected in the table above are primarily commitments to purchase handsets and accessories, equipment, software, programming and network services, and marketing activities, which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business. these amounts do not represent t-mobile's entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which t-mobile is contractually committed. where t-mobile is committed to make a minimum payment to the supplier regardless of whether it takes delivery, t-mobile has included only that minimum payment as a purchase obligation. additionally, included within purchase obligations are amounts for the acquisition of spectrum licenses, which are subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.
in january 2018, we closed on a unit purchase agreement to acquire the remaining equity in ins, a 54% owned unconsolidated subsidiary, for a purchase price of $25 million. see note 13 - commitments and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
in january 2018, we closed on our previously announced acquisition of layer3 tv, inc. ("layer3 tv") for consideration of approximately $325 million, subject to customary working capital and other post-closing adjustments. upon closing of the transaction, layer3 tv became a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary. see note 13 - commitments and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
off-balance sheet arrangements in 2015, we entered into an arrangement, as amended, to sell certain eip accounts receivable on a revolving basis as an additional source of liquidity. in august 2017, the arrangement was amended to reduce the maximum funding commitment to $1.2 billion and extend the scheduled expiration date to november 2018. in december 2017, the arrangement was again
51
amended to increase the maximum funding commitment to $1.3 billion. see note 3 - sales of certain receivables of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
in 2014, we entered into an arrangement, as amended, to sell certain service accounts receivable on a revolving basis as an additional source of liquidity. in november 2016, the arrangement was amended to increase the maximum funding commitment to $950 million and extend the scheduled expiration date to march 2018. in february 2018, the arrangement was again amended to extend the scheduled expiration date to march 2019. as of december 31, 2017, t-mobile derecognized net receivables of $2.7 billion upon sale through these arrangements. see note 3 - sales of certain receivables of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
related-party transactions during the year ended december 31, 2017, we entered into certain debt related transactions with affiliates. see note 7 - debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
we also have related party transactions associated with dt or its affiliates in the ordinary course of business, including intercompany servicing and licensing.
disclosure of iranian activities under section 13(r) of the securities exchange act of 1934
section 219 of the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 added section 13(r) to the exchange act of 1934, as amended ("exchange act"). section 13(r) requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to iran or with designated natural persons or entities involved in terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. disclosure is required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted outside the u.s. by non-u.s. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under u.s. law.
as of the date of this report, we are not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing by us or any of our affiliates for the year ended december 31, 2017, that requires disclosure in this report under section 13(r) of the exchange act, except as set forth below with respect to affiliates that we do not control and that are our affiliates solely due to their common control with dt. we have relied upon dt for information regarding their activities, transactions and dealings.
dt, through certain of its non-u.s. subsidiaries, is party to roaming and interconnect agreements with the following mobile and fixed line telecommunication providers in iran, some of which are or may be government-controlled entities: gostaresh ertebatat taliya, irancell telecommunications services company ("mtn irancell"), telecommunication kish company, mobile telecommunication company of iran, and telecommunication infrastructure company of iran. for the year ended december 31, 2017, gross revenues of all dt affiliates generated by roaming and interconnection traffic with iran were less than $4 million and estimated net profits were less than $4 million.
in addition, dt, through certain of its non-u.s. subsidiaries, operating a fixed line network in their respective european home countries (in particular germany), provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to the embassy of iran in those european countries. gross revenues and net profits recorded from these activities for the year ended december 31, 2017 were less than $0.4 million. we understand that dt intends to continue these activities.
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition as they require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
six of these policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. actual results could differ from those estimates.
management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies.
52
allowances we maintain an allowance for credit losses, which is management's estimate of such losses inherent in the receivables portfolio, comprised of accounts receivable and eip receivable segments. changes in the allowance for credit losses and, therefore, in related provision for credit losses ("bad debt expense") can materially affect earnings. credit risk characteristics are assessed for each receivable segment. in applying the judgment and review required to determine the allowance for credit losses, management considers a number of factors, including customer behavior, credit quality of the customer base and other qualitative factors such as macro-economic conditions. while our methodology attributes portions of the allowance to specific portfolio segments, the entire allowance for credit losses is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total receivables portfolio.
management also considers an amount that represents management's judgment of risks inherent in the process and assumptions used in establishing the allowance for credit losses, including process risk and other subjective factors, including industry trends and emerging risk assessments.
to the extent that actual loss experience differs significantly from historical trends or assumptions, the appropriate allowance levels for realized credit losses could differ from the estimate. we write off account balances if collection efforts are unsuccessful and the receivable balance is deemed uncollectible, based on customer credit ratings and the length of time from the original billing date.
we offer certain retail customers the option to pay for their devices and other purchases in installments over a period of up to 24 months using a zero interest eip. at the time of an installment sale, we impute a discount for interest and record the eip receivables at their present value, which is determined by discounting future payments at the imputed interest rate. the difference between the present value of the eip receivables and their face amount results in a discount which is recorded as a direct reduction to the carrying value of the eip receivable with a corresponding reduction to equipment revenue. the imputed discount rate is primarily comprised of current market interest rates and the estimated credit risk on the eip receivables. as a result, we do not recognize a separate valuation allowance at the time of issuance as the effects of uncertainty about future cash flows are included in the initial present value measurement of the eip receivable. the imputed discount on eip receivables is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and recognized as other revenues in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
subsequent to the initial determination of the imputed discount, we recognize an allowance for credit losses to the extent the amount of estimated credit losses on the gross eip receivable segment exceed the remaining unamortized imputed discount balances.
total imputed discount and allowances as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 was approximately 8.1% and 8.0%, respectively, of the total amount of gross accounts receivable, including eip receivables.
depreciation depreciation commences once assets have been placed in service. we generally depreciate property and equipment over the period the property and equipment provide economic benefit. leased wireless devices are depreciated to their estimated residual value over the period expected to provide utility to t-mobile, which is generally shorter than the lease term and considers expected losses. depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property, plant and equipment. these studies consider actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution. when these factors indicate that an asset's useful life is different from the previous assessment, the remaining book values are depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies and note 4 - property and equipment of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for information regarding depreciation of assets, including management's underlying estimates of useful lives.
evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment we assess the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our spectrum licenses, for potential impairment annually as of december 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired.
when assessing goodwill for impairment we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. if we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative
53
assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative test. we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a market approach, which is based on market capitalization. we recognize market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor changes in market capitalization to determine whether declines, if any, necessitate an interim impairment review. in the event market capitalization does decline below its book value, we will consider the length, severity and reasons for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists, including considering whether a control premium should be added to the market capitalization. we believe short-term fluctuations in share price may not necessarily reflect the underlying aggregate fair value.
we test spectrum licenses for impairment on an aggregate basis, consistent with the management of the overall business at a national level. we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying value. if we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset. if the carrying amount of spectrum licenses exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. we estimate the fair value of the spectrum licenses using the greenfield approach, which is an income approach that estimates the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. the greenfield approach values the spectrum licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the asset to be valued (in this case, spectrum licenses). the value of the spectrum licenses can be considered as equal to the present value of the cash flows of this hypothetical start-up company. we base the assumptions underlying the greenfield approach on a combination of market participant data and our historical results, trends and business plans. future cash flows in the greenfield approach are based on estimates and assumptions of market participant revenues, ebitda margin, network build-out period and a long-term growth rate for a market participant. the cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital.
the valuation approaches utilized to estimate fair value for the purposes of the impairment tests of goodwill and spectrum licenses require the use of assumptions and estimates, which involve a degree of uncertainty. if actual results or future expectations are not consistent with the assumptions, this may result in the recording of significant impairment charges on goodwill or spectrum licenses. the most significant assumptions within the valuation models are the discount rate, revenues, ebitda margins, capital expenditures and the long-term growth rate. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies and note 5 - goodwill, spectrum licenses and other intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for information regarding our annual impairment test and impairment charges.
guarantee liabilities we offer a device trade-in program, jump!, which provides eligible customers a specified-price trade-in right to upgrade their device. upon enrollment, participating customers must finance the purchase of a device on an eip and have a qualifying t-mobile monthly wireless service plan, which is treated as a single multiple-element arrangement when entered into at or near the same time. upon qualifying jump! program upgrades, the customers' remaining eip balance is settled provided they trade-in their eligible used device in good working condition and purchase a new device from us on a new eip.
for customers who enroll in jump!, we establish a liability through the reduction of revenue, for the portion of revenue which represents the estimated fair value of the specified-price trade-in right guarantee. the guarantee liability is valued based on various economic and customer behavioral assumptions, which requires judgment, including estimating the customer's remaining eip balance at trade-in, the expected fair value of the used device at trade-in, and the probability and timing of trade-in. when customers upgrade their device, the difference between the eip balance credit to the customer and the fair value of the returned device is recorded against the guarantee liabilities. all assumptions are reviewed periodically.
rent expense most of the leases on our tower sites have fixed rent escalations which provide for periodic increases in the amount of rent payable over time. we calculate straight-line rent expense for each of these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes a penalty on us in such amount that a renewal appears, at lease inception or significant modification, to be reasonably assured. we consider several factors in assessing whether renewal periods are reasonably assured of being exercised, including the continued maturation of our network nationwide, technological advances within the telecommunications industry and the availability of alternative sites. we make
54
significant assumptions at lease inception in determining and assessing the factors that constitute a "penalty." in doing so, we primarily consider costs incurred in acquiring and developing new sites, the useful life of site improvements and equipment costs, future economic conditions and the extent to which improvements in wireless technologies can be incorporated into a current assessment of whether an economic compulsion will exist in the future to renew a lease.
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these differences are realized. a valuation allowance is maintained against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions within the carryforward periods available. we consider many factors when determining whether a valuation allowance is needed, including recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future income, the carryforward periods available for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors.
we account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. we assess whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position and adjust the unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law.
